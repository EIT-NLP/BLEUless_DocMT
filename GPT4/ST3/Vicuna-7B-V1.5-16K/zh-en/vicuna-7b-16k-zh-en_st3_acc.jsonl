Lin signed the \\\"Factory Building Purchase and Sale Agreement\\\" as the recipient of the deposit, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer.

This is a trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. When I was caught up in the moment, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The quote they gave me had many problems: it did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom. These three items alone account for a significant portion of the basic renovation costs.They charge higher fees for their services compared to other companies. I lost trust in this company after they didn't disclose everything upfront and made me sign a contract.

As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount. This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn\u2019t really think it through. Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn\u2019t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation. Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies. I\u2019ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn\u2019t explain anything clearly. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me. Anyway, they just said it was the client\u2019s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it. They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don\u2019t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage. Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it\u2019s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else. So please don\u2019t choose such a swindler company. When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.

The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost. Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities. The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation. The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases. The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses. According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control."}

The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint.The chairman of this organization, Wan Yuchong, said at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three schools has basically remained the same. Many studies have shown that these top schools discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process through \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\". Wan Yuchong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate compared to all other ethnic groups.According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and request that the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions. They also hope that the schools that are being sued will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously sued Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.

As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
