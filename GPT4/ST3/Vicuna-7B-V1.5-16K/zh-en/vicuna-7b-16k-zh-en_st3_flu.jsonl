Tian Pengyu said: \\\"The objective of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, enabling Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art.\\\" It is reported that during the period of the opening of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

{"translation1": "\"In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province, from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building. In December 2020, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member Lin and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring the money through a bank. Lin signed the \\\"Factory Building Purchase and Sale Agreement\\\" as the recipient of the deposit, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agreed to sign the factory building purchase and sale agreement within a week.However, after the two parties failed to reach a consensus on issues such as the scope of the factory and the payment method in the sales contract, the house purchase contract was delayed and could not be signed. Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin decided to refund the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After finally finding a house that he liked, paid the deposit, and was ready to pay the balance, he was just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller refused to sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court. The court after reviewing the case found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not required to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract and returning double the deposit. After the first-instance ruling, the plaintiff appealed.Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment. [Legal Advice] In the trading process, it is necessary to exercise due diligence. As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence in the signing of the contract, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information, and clearly stating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is mostly fluent with proper grammar and word usage, but a few points seem slightly unnatural.

Also, the transition between sentences could be smoother to improve the overall flow of the text. Finally, 'Mr. Lin decided to refund the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu' seems to conflict with the earlier statement mentioning 'a deposit of 200,000 yuan'.

I'm not sure what kind of materials they used, as I didn't pay much attention to their materials. Their second trick is that you can just come to the store and hand over the deposit (once you've paid the deposit, you can never get your money back unless you have enough experience and know how to deal with them).When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. When I was caught up in the moment, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The quote they gave me had many problems: it did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom.

{"translation1": "\"The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control work in border cities. The notice requires that people who leave land border cities (excluding those with a border with Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test result, and after arriving in the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the border city range and announcing it in each province, autonomous region, and municipality, to March 15, 2022.In addition, it is noted that under certain conditions, cities at the border can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction. The National Health Commission's Office of Disease Prevention and Control has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent exchange between the two sides of the border. Implementing differentiated management policies based on the division of regions can turn the first line of defense from one to two lines, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.Recently, there have been several domestic cluster-type epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemic areas through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as delayed and inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, poor implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formalism in regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of cold chain items at various nodes, inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies. The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the mechanism of border city epidemic control, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control work of border cities, and to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work in a rigorous and scientifically accurate manner, to tighten the defense line against the import of epidemics.Notice emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the study and deployment of epidemic prevention and ensuring people's livelihood work, publish and publicize the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, regularly check and resolve hidden dangers in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices, and promptly respond to and proactively address prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notice, the border cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the prefecture-level cities, autonomous regions, and municipalities where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on epidemic prevention needs and announced in a timely manner.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent in English.

{"translation1": "\"A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint.The chairman of this organization, Wan Yuchong, said at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three schools has basically remained the same. Many studies have shown that these top schools discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process through \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\". Wan Yuchong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate compared to all other ethnic groups.According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and request that the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions. They also hope that the schools that are being sued will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously sued Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese American community, other groups such as the Indian American, Japanese American, Korean American, and Pakistani American education organizations have also participated in the lawsuit.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.
