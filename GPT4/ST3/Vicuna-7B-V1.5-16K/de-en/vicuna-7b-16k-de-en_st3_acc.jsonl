{"translation1": "\"Is tire choice when cycling really as safe as advertised? This morning, I woke up full of determination, wanting to at least train a little for my upcoming cycling tour next week. Well, I did it and I rode my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.The first 40km were really nice - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) happened. Glass splinters on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the route on no account.Because of the day of the week, I didn't have a real opportunity to get a spare jacket and spare tube, so I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home.

However, when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km of riding, I think I'll be in a pretty bad mood: :DNow I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform about why I don't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unrepairable. Of course, that all sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible?I have little desire to spend 40\u20ac/tire right now, only to be disappointed. Furthermore, I ask myself: when I was on the racing bike, I believed I had 25x622. Although it is also available (apparently) at the Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend other tires to me for a racing bike?

{"translation1": "\"I am bored with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased so much that I need to vent a bit with this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time.Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning put the schedule far behind schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) if necessary. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it's still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.Nonetheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule misunderstanding among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag in F1. Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were relevant radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was a possibility for Verstappen. I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules if they comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel. It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules. Both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.Generally, Roos' artificial commenting style doesn't appeal to me, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. However, I genuinely find Heiko Water from RTL better. There are constant nonsensical things that both come across as unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The latest commentator is causing a lot of commotion in the comments, which seems not to take him seriously. Not least, advertising takes over on Sky, while in the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear the German commentary without commentary after the race on F1TV. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Although these two channels show less advertising than Sky, and as free TV channels, I must say that Glock and Baumgartner deserve praise for their work. However, this does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sports F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit the F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, excluding advertising. So, the fantastic F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.I would be interested in your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Wrong Translation: The first sentence translation changed 'annoyed' in the reference text to 'bored' in the text to evaluate.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
