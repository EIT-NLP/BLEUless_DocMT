Now it wasn't too bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who rode 120km on them until 2pm on the day I picked up the bike) were also suboptimal, as he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tire after 80-90km of riding, I am really in a bad mood :DNow I have struck up a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be indestructible. Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really unbreakable?I have little desire to spend 40\u20ac/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end.

{"translation1": "\"Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \\\"Valve Reactor\\\" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.Even these amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.With the \\\"Tone Room\\\" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for here. All guitarists dream of the warmth and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.The valve reactor circuit with a 12AX7 tube in every VT+ amplifier embodies the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is mostly fluent with minor errors but doesn't impede understanding.

{"translation1": "\"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted mid-F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning had put the schedule far behind schedule, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!). Apparently, however, this is not possible for legal reasons, so that everything else has to be restricted, which is why Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it is stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race.Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was rule ignorance among the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. In my opinion, such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first puzzle-guessing, as now according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.I do not generally like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I acknowledge that it is a matter of taste. However, I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.Just the latter brings a lot of turmoil into the commentary, as he apparently does not take it seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, where in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Even these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air broadcasters. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overcome the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that covers the F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is mostly fluent, with some minor errors that do not impede understanding.

While there are a couple of phrases that sound somewhat unnatural and could be rephrased for the sake of clarity, such as 'only with a shortened light duration can be expected when the days become shorter' or 'no snow impairs the function of the solar module', they don't significantly hinder comprehension. Overall, the text is close to a highly fluent piece of English writing, but the slight awkwardness in phrasing prevents the score from being a 5.\" } }"}

I hope it will be returned and I get a full refund.This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"2\", \"Explanation\": \"The text's fluency could be improved. The phrases 'noticed it when I took the soft foam' and 'I hope it will be returned' are not grammatically incorrect, but they are vague and difficult to understand within the given context. The first sentence has incomplete thoughts which needs further elaboration for clarity. Also, the sentence 'This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.' appears to contain a placeholder (#NAME#) that hasn't been replaced by the correct content.\" } }"}
