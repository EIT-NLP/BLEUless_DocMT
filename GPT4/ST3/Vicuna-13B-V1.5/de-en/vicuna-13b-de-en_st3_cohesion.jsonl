But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not have this problem more often. Now it wasn't too bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who rode 120km on them until 2pm on the day I picked up the bike) were also suboptimal, as he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tire after 80-90km of riding, I am really in a bad mood :DNow I have struck up a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be indestructible. Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really unbreakable?I have little desire to spend 40\u20ac/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end. Furthermore, I am asking myself: I currently have on my racing bike, I believe, 25x622. This is also available (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend me to other tires for a racing bike?

The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and this also comes to the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox. Having said this, the full 500 is not received by the other DLan module, which is sending out the WiFi, but rather the more I move away from the module within the house, the less it receives (using an outlet, which is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module). That means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the second floor than it was before (\\~45 Mbit). I ordered a new Devolo Magic set as well, which is supposed to be using a new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but it still lead to similar, significant losses. Can someone please explain to me how so much internet speed is \u201cgoing lost\u201d through the power line? And is LAN really the only solution?

{"translation1": "\"Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \\\"Valve Reactor\\\" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.Even these amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.With the \\\"Tone Room\\\" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for here. All guitarists dream of the warmth and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.The valve reactor circuit with a 12AX7 tube in every VT+ amplifier embodies the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the \u201cValve Reactor\u201d circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

Nevertheless, it is stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race.Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was rule ignorance among the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. In my opinion, such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first puzzle-guessing, as now according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.I do not generally like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I acknowledge that it is a matter of taste. However, I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.Just the latter brings a lot of turmoil into the commentary, as he apparently does not take it seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, where in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Even these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air broadcasters. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overcome the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that covers the F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}

He first fought off the attacks of Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, jumping from third to the top. Then he changed something on the material settings and managed a great leap forward of 0.30 seconds on Sunday. Along with his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberb\u00e4renburg) and Alexander Sch\u00fcller (SV Halle), he pulled himself ahead of the British Brad Hall. Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier. \u201cWe took on a great risk today and we were rewarded,\u201d said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd win in the series. The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth after coming in second before. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach came in eighth place after landing in fourth in the first run. \u201cIf I knew what he was doing differently, then I would also do that,\u201d Lochner said.
