At the time, I was shocked and afraid that I would end up choosing too many).Today's photos were edited well by Lanlan and sent to me.

They didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote and say that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't even know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that once you came to the store, they would drag you into paying the deposit (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, they can give you how much discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan deposit. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom was not included.

The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert force, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving large-scale tea farmers to increase income.The wind water turns alternately, and red tea exerts its strength again. According to tea experts in the industry, after harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens increases linearly. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leader awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the \\\"Hunan Red Tea\\\" trademark, and new changes welcomed the \\\"Lake Red Source\\\".In the Xinhuai Tea Exhibition Hall, a tea merchant from Fujian was attracted by a type of tea called \\\"Ice in Spring\\\" and placed an order on the spot. The secretary-general of the provincial tea industry association, Wang Jun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea leaf market, but from the tea expo site, it can be seen that there are many highlights. The Xinhuai red tea has a touch of red, injecting cultural connotations into tea, and the popularity and trading are booming.

Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: Xinhua is the source of Hunan Black Tea, and the emerging of the black tea injects new energy into the \u201ccolorful Hunan tea\u201d. In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the Hunan tea industry of 100 billion and formed the development pattern of \u201cthree Xiang, four rivers, and five colors of tea\u201d. The tea industry of the province has been promoting innovation, and main tea types such as green tea and black tea take turns to generate power; tea-travel integration is promoted in main tea production areas to drive income increase of tea farmers. Every type of tea takes turns to gain its spotlight, and now it is time for black tea. According to opinion of experts in the tea industry in the province, tea farmers pick black tea after green tea and have income in all four seasons, making the production value of tea gardens soar. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of \u201cHunan black tea\u201d, and Xinhua was awarded the title of \u201csource of Hunan black tea\u201d. In the exhibition hall of Xinhua black tea, a tea merchant from Fujian took a fancy to a high mountain tea named \u201cspring in ice\u201d and placed an order immediately. Wang Zhun, secretary-general of provincial tea association, said happily that factors such as epidemic exert an impact on the tea market to a certain extent; however, based on the situations at the tea expo, there are various highlights. The red color of Xinhua black tea has instilled the essence of tea culture, and with its popularity and hot transactions, the Hunan tea industry is ushering in a new spring."}

Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.

They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
