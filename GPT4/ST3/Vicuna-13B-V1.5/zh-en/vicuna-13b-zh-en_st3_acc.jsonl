That was the first time that I had officially put on makeup and wow, I couldn\u2019t even believe that I could be so pretty one day, haha.

The photographer was funny, and we were happy throughout the day. When choosing the photos, I saw many cases online where they wouldn\u2019t let the customers delete too many photos, but they didn\u2019t ask us to add photos at all, just the 24 photos in the set and nothing more (I heard that my cousin who was also taking wedding dress photos added photos worth over 10,000 in addition to the 7,000 yuan set, and I was stunned and feared I might choose too many). The editing was finished today and Lanlan sent it to me; I felt two were not good enough and they immediately re-edited them for me. I found the old photos of my sister to make comparison, and I felt that our photos were really satisfying, simple and fresh, exactly what I wanted. I sincerely recommend choosing Xuanhan Mrs. Gold to take your wedding dress photoshoot! Set price: 3,999 yuan Mrs. Gold is grateful for you and sincerely wishes you a happy life and a promising future! How much is this set?"}

They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't even know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that once you came to the store, they would drag you into paying the deposit (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, they can give you how much discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan deposit. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom was not included. These three are the basic costs.Excluding their service charges, which are higher than those of other companies, I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything to me before I signed the contract.

The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three top schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called \\\"holistic review\\\" admission process, systematically and continuously. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the admission rate of Asians relative to the total number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhu Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in admissions. They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.

Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years.
