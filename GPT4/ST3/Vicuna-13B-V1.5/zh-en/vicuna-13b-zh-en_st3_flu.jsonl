Each bottle of red label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to savor it, won't you waste its aroma and flavor?So, how do you drink Red Letter Whiskey? Let me introduce it to you simply. The method of drinking Red Letter Whiskey is as follows:The Glenfiddich 15-year-old single malt Scotch whisky is made from a blend of about 35 different Scotch whiskies. It has a rich and fragrant aroma with traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, and a fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. On the palate, it is rich and refreshing with a hint of grassiness. This whisky can be enjoyed on its own over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.Red wine enters the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the people, red wine + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other fizzy drinks have become a timeless fashion. These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also visually bring pleasure to people, and play a role in diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the mouthfeel when added to the drink. The most authentic and traditional way to drink red wine is with slices of lemon and sugar (cane sugar is also acceptable).The authentic red wine has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon can bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine.

After the court conducted a trial, it determined that both parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to solely blame the defendant. Therefore, the case should not apply the penalty of double the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the liability of breaching the contract by paying double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.Recently, the Second Circuit Court upheld the original judgment.

As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence in verifying information such as the ownership of the property, whether the property is currently occupied, and other relevant information when signing the contract.

They didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote and say that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't even know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that once you came to the store, they would drag you into paying the deposit (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, they can give you how much discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan deposit. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom was not included.

{"translation1": "\"The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism has issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control at ports of entry. It stipulates that those who have recently left land border ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) must provide proof of a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and those entering land border ports of entry must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The notice states that this requirement will be in effect from the date of announcement of the port of entry cities by each province, district, and municipality until March 15, 2022.In addition, the notice proposes that cities with ports that meet certain conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. A relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support, and frequent exchanges occur between the two sides of the border. By implementing differentiated management policies, a single line of epidemic prevention and control can become two lines, which is expected to achieve pre-border control, compress the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported through ports of entry in cities. The aforementioned notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, inadequate implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of the entire cold chain, inadequate management of quarantine sites, and inadequate scientific and precise handling of epidemic emergencies. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to fill the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control work in port cities, without any relaxation, and to do the work of epidemic prevention and control in a scientific and precise manner, and to tighten the external defense line to prevent the importation of the epidemic.The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the work of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihoods, publish and publicize the hotline for people's livelihood protection, and regularly investigate and address potential risks in areas such as the supply and price of basic necessities of life. According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include those with land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, cities, leagues), and directly-administered municipalities, with the specific scope determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is mostly fluent with minor errors, but the overall readability is high, allowing for clear understanding of the content.

{"translation1": "\"Asian American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a joint complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on the 23rd, protesting against discrimination against Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three top schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called \\\"holistic review\\\" admission process, systematically and continuously. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the admission rate of Asians relative to the total number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhu Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in admissions. They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's complaint also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"This text is mostly fluent with a structured narrative and clear messaging.
