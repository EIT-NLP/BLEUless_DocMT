So, I said and did it, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the way.Since I couldn't really buy a replacement jacket and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home.

However, when I think that I still need to change the tires after 80-90km, I am not in a good mood: DNow I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who surprised me by asking why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbeatable. Now it all sounds very tempting. But are they really so indestructible?I don't want to spend 40\u20ac/rear tire right now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike. Although it is also available (apparently) for Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.Is this a problem?

After 22 minutes, the team from Hessen, which had recently lost twice in a row, seemed to be on its way to its next soccer failure. But then the SGE turned themselves around and were able to shoot the frustration of a poor start to the season out of their soul within an hour, leading to a furious 5-2 victory. \u201cIt was crazy what the boys were able to accomplish today,\u201d Coach Oliver Glasner said with jubilee at DAZN and spoke of \u201cpraise all around, to each and every one of them who were there\u201d. At the beginning, it seemed like another setback for the team from Frankfurt, who are now at place nine and still not living up to their expectations. Patrik Schick brought the team from Leverkusen to a 2-0 lead. What happened next deeply effected the SGE coach. \u201cThe way the players were able to take it back and display a fantastic performance,\u201d according to Glasner. I am extremely happy with the performance, which we showed and also with the result. Defender Christopher Lenz, who was playing for the first time since the fourth game day and overcoming his muscle injury, really emphasized team moral. \u201cI think that our mentality is unbelievably great\u201d, the 27-year-old said and was happy after checking the scoreboard, especially how it effects the viewers. That was the party that we wanted to throw today. However, Glasner still wants to keep focused for the upcoming challenges, but sees himself well set when considering his personal situation. It is extraordinary that all of us players are so fit in December, that we are in tip top shape. It is pristine work by our medical department, but our players are also living extremely professionally. Now we want to \u201ckeep going step for step and stay determined\u201d and \u201cexecute at this same level\u201d the challenges up until the years end.

{"translation1": "\"I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased significantly throughout the season, so I want to vent a bit with this post. Firstly, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to ensure punctual F1 coverage.Although the schedule was significantly behind due to the delayed start and the crash at the beginning, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Sky UK, on the other hand, broadcast the race until the end.Despite a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a rule incompetence among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to this topic to Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is a possibility for Verstappen. I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on Formula 1 for a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first riddle regarding what is now allowed or prescribed by the rules, both have simply had constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL much better, even though I don't like his constant jokes, which make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The last one brings total chaos in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, and in the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear from F1TV after the race, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Both of these channels make less advertising during their training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel. Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very scarce and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-speaking broadcaster for Formula 1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to transmit, except for the advertising. So, at least, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would be interested in your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \n\"Addition: The statement 'Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work' is an addition because it is not found in the reference text.\",\n\"Omission: The statement from the reference text 'The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen' has been omitted in the evaluated text.\",\n\"Wrong Translation: 'I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1' was translated to 'I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1' which conveys slightly different emotions.\",\n\"Wrong Translation: 'It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules,' was translated to 'It is also not the first riddle regarding what is now allowed or prescribed by the rules,' which changes the tone of the sentence.\",\n\"Wrong Translation: 'In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher,' was translated to 'Then there was again a rule incompetence among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher,' which changes the tone of the sentence.\",\n\"Omission: The phrase 'the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident' is missing from the evaluated text.\"\n]} }", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
