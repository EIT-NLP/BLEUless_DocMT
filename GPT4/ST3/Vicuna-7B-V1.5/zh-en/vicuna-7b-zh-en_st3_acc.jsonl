However, there is no dedicated industry standard for foot baths, which poses a certain safety risk. \\\"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation in his soles.Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that was causing the sensation in his feet, but he didn't realize that he had turned off the vibration function. Even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store and the store's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.Because he discovered that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the popular bathtub that has been around for a long time, such as how to set the highest temperature, which group of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process.

Appearance and material: the appearance looks cool; game laptops are eye catching; display effect: the screen is clear and 1080 is enough for playing games. I think it is pretty good; I mainly used it to do design and it is very cost-effective, lighter and prettier than I thought; the red on its rear side is a beautiful wine color, not garish at all; it far exceeded my expectation overall and is worth purchasing, suitable for girls as well. Two years ago, I gained contact with Acer shadow knight, and I think it is cost-effective and has great quality after the two years use. I also recommended my friends to buy this product! I have bought three laptops of this series! It looks beautiful and has good configurations. I bought it for my nephew; I thought I would wait for the 418 bank sale, but he needed it urgently and I just bought it earlier, so it was a pity that I wasn\u2019t able to participate in the big bank sale. But it was cost-effective and shipping was fast; I\u2019ll make a follow-up review after using it for some time. Brand new in original packaging, highly cost-effective game laptop; design style is good and windows 11 and office 2019 have already been installed. Display effect: I bought it for my child to do 3D rendering; the software has been installed and my child said it worked fine; this laptop works OK for 3D design. I bought it for my son, and he said it\u2019s pretty good. The laptop is good; the customer service staff is really nice; just ask them if you have any question; recommended. Not bad, the image quality for playing games is really nice."}

I was just there to show them my house model, but they didn't even go to measure the house.

This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. I was impulsive and paid over 10,000 yuan in deposit. The quote they gave me had many problems. The price did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom, which are the costs of basic installation.The service fees of these companies are higher than those of other companies. I lost trust in this company because they didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and made me sign a contract.

Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the \\\"holistic consideration\\\" admission process.

Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that they hope to submit a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action after the fact to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions. They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.Currently, the three schools that have been complained about have not made any responses. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices.
