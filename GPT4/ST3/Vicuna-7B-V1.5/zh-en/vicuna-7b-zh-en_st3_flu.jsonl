However, there is no dedicated industry standard for foot baths, which poses a certain safety risk. \\\"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation in his soles.Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that was causing the sensation in his feet, but he didn't realize that he had turned off the vibration function. Even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified.

{"translation1": "\"In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory building located in Shaoxing, Yongjia, Zhejiang from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory building. In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring money through a bank. Ms. Lin signed the \\\"Factory Building Sale and Purchase Agreement\\\" as the payee, and it was stipulated in the agreement that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would belong to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer doubled. Both parties agreed to sign the factory building sale and purchase agreement within a week.However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as factory building sales range and payment methods, the house purchase and sale contract was delayed again and again. Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu. After a long search, Mr. Liu finally found a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu feel helpless and angry.For this reason, Mr. Lin sued Mr. Wang to the Yuyang City People's Court. The court, after hearing, considered that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. Therefore, it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply the penalty of double return of deposit. The defendant did not need to bear the breach of contract liability for returning the deposit twice. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict. [Legal advisor] In the course of trade, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of prudence and caution. As a buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of prudence and caution when signing a contract, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information.

{"translation1": "\"The National Defense and Epidemic Prevention Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in border cities. It requires that people who need to leave the land border cities (excluding those with Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours must have a 48-hour nucleic acid test negative certificate, and after arriving in the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, region, and city and the announcement of the border city range to March 15, 2022.In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, cities along the border can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdiction. The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office responsible person introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar for the local area, and people from both sides travel back and forth frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies, which was originally a single line of defense, can become two lines of defense, with the hope of achieving pre-emptive control and compressing the risk of epidemic spread, thus achieving the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.Recently, there have been many local outbreaks of the epidemic in China, all of which are imported from abroad through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems in the monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk positions, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain logistics, the irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made from nine aspects, including completing the mechanisms for border city epidemic prevention and control, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the management of centralized isolation sites. We must not relax our guard, do scientific and precise work in epidemic prevention and control, and tighten the defenses at the border to prevent the import of epidemics.The notice emphasizes that cities along the coast should synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the guarantee of basic living needs, and publish and widely disseminate the hotline for basic living needs guarantee. It should regularly inspect the supply and price of basic living necessities, and promptly solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the public. According to the notice, the cities along the coast include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (autonomous regions, municipalities), and directly-administered cities located at the land, water, and air ports. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

{"translation1": "\"A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington D.C. on the same day.The chairman of this group, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has doubled, but in these three top American universities, the proportion of Asians remains basically the same. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the \\\"holistic consideration\\\" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the admission rate for Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that they hope to submit a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action after the fact to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions. They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.Currently, the three schools that have been complained about have not made any responses. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices. However, the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the complaint, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education organizations that participated in the complaint.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent, with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.
