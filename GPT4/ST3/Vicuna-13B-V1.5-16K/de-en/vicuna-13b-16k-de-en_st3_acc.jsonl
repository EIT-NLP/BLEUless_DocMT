With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.Even these amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.With the \\\"Tone Room\\\" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001. Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.The valve reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Omission: The evaluated text did not mention that the model of amps 'deals with real analogue circuits'.\", \"Wrong Translation: The evaluated text incorrectly referred to the Valvetronix tube amplifiers as 'Valvetronix tube preamplifier'.\", \"Addition: The evaluated text added that the VT+ amplifier is equipped with a 12AX7 tube, which was not mentioned in the reference text.\", \"Omission: The evaluated text omitted the point that the VOX valve reactor was 'introduced in 2001\", \"Omission: The evaluated text omitted the information about the renewed power boost to the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 leading to more dynamics and improved amplifier models.\"] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the \u201cValve Reactor\u201d circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

{"translation1": "\"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, today during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.Although the delayed start and the starting accident disrupted the schedule, it was still possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision. Apparently, however, legal reasons give F1 priority, and therefore everything else must be restricted, which is why Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the entire race.Nonetheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something that is possible or required is a puzzle. Both have constant uncertainties about the rules.Generally, I don't like Roos's artificial commentary style, but I acknowledge that it's a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL even more serious. Additionally, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The latter brings a lot of unrest in the commentary, as he clearly does not take it seriously. Advertising simply takes over at Sky, as can be heard in the out lap, where Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary is sufficient and must be played directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Both of these broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overlook the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job except for the advertising during the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the magnificent F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Omission: Omitted specific mistakes in commentary such as the 'Ahhhh HD' from Ralf Schumacher from the evaluated text.\", \"Addition: The evaluated text added the phrase 'Ironically' that wasn't present in the reference text.\", \"Omission: 'The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions' was missing from the evaluated text.\", \"Omission: 'It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules' was paraphrased inaccurately in the evaluated text.\" ]} }", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
