Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week.However, after that, both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory's sale and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house purchase contract.

We had to change the shooting time twice because we could not arrange the time well. The consultant, Lanlan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time. Later, we chose to shoot on a sunny weekend.The staff at Madame Jin's workplace, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised. That was my first formal makeup job, wow~ I can't believe it, I will become that beautiful one day, hahaha. Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and the makeup looked very natural.The outdoor photos were taken in Jiangwan City, fortunately the weather was very good and we didn't feel too cold during the photo shoot. The makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothing and accessories, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right. The photographer was also very funny and we felt happy all day during the photo shoot. When it came to choosing the photos, we saw many examples online and didn't want to delete too many photos for the clients, but when we were choosing the photos, we didn't have any intention of adding any, we just chose the 24 photos that came with the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister, who took her wedding photos at the same place, had a package of over 7,000 yuan and added over 1,000 photos, at that time I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many).The photos have been fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. After looking at two of them, I thought they weren't quite good enough, and they immediately helped me redo them. I took out the photos of my sister that were taken before and compared them to ours. I think we are really satisfied with our photos, they are simple, clean, and have the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Furen to take wedding dress photos!Set price: 3999 yuan. Thank you, Madame, for your sincere wishes.

They could actually give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan, and they didn't even know what brand of materials they were using. Their second scam was that you would have to pay the deposit as soon as you got to the store (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three were the basic fees.Excluding their service fees, which are higher than those of other companies, I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and made me sign the contract.

There are various ways to shift responsibility, and there are many details that I don't want to go into, it's all too sad. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they did the decoration for also had poor quality, and they ended up charging various fees later on. It's a scam, they are just the head of the dragon decoration that originally deceived people, now they've changed their name and become something else.So don't choose such incompetent decoration companies.

Vice Chairman of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Association and Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Huo Shunli, attended the opening ceremony.Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in new industries, and the rise of red tea injects new impetus as \\\"Five-color Tea of Xiang\\\". In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-dollar Xiang tea industry, forming a development pattern of \\\"Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five-color Tea\\\". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have taken turns to launch. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving a large increase in income for tea farmers.The winds of fortune shift, and red tea is making a comeback. Provincial tea experts say that by harvesting green tea and black tea, tea farmers can have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens is on the rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the \\\"Lake Red Tea\\\" trademark, and welcomed the launch of \\\"Lake Red Tea's Origin\\\".In the New Xihu Red Tea Museum, a tea merchant from Fujian saw a high mountain tea named \\\"Ice in Spring\\\" and immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Fujian Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with joy that the tea market has been affected to some extent by the epidemic and other factors, but from the tea exhibition, it can be seen that there are many highlights. The New Xihu Red Tea has a touch of red, injecting the tea culture connotation, and the popularity is high, the transaction is hot.

According to lots of research results, these universities \u201cdiscriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way\u201d during the so-called \u201ccomprehensive consideration\u201dof the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US."}
