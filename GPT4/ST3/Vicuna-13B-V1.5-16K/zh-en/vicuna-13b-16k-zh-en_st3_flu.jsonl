Each bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't you be wasting its aroma and taste?How to drink Red Label Whisky? Here's a simple introduction from the author:  To enjoy Red Label Whisky, start by pouring a shot of the whisky into a glass. You can add a few ice cubes to cool it down if you prefer. Then, swirl the whisky gently in the glass to release its aroma. Take a small sip and savor the taste. You can also add a splash of water or a dash of mixer like soda or ginger ale to enhance the flavor. Remember to drink responsibly and in moderation.Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch Whisky is made from a blend of about 35 Scottish whiskies, with a rich and traditional flavor of Scottish whisky, characterized by a rich and fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. On the palate, it is rich and refreshing with a hint of mint and a strong smoky malt flavor. This whisky can be enjoyed straight over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.Johnnie Walker whisky has entered the Chinese market, and to cater to the tastes of the Chinese people, Johnnie Walker whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other fizzy drinks have become a timeless fashion. These sweet drinks not only neutralize the sourness, but also visually bring pleasure to people, and when added to the drink, they have the effect of changing the taste of the whisky. The most authentic and traditional way to drink Johnnie Walker whisky is with slices of orange and sugar (sand sugar is also possible).The authentic red label whiskey has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize its acidity, and lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the drink. Of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.

{"translation1": "\"In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yuejia Town, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and signed a \\\"Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Agreement.\\\" The agreement stipulated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit of 200,000 yuan would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week.However, after that, both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory's sale and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house purchase contract. Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu had prepared for the house purchase, including the deposit and the down payment, but the seller did not sign the contract, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yuyang Municipal People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double compensation for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit.

This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan.

The time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the port city scope by each province, district, and municipality to March 15, 2022.In addition, the notice also proposes that conditionally open ports can study setting epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions. The person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Agency introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support, and the exchange between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies based on regions, a single line of epidemic prevention and control can become two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the advance of the border epidemic prevention and control, reduce the spread of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.Recently, there have been several local clustered outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry. The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposes some problems such as insufficient and untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some localities, non-implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disposal of cold-chain products at all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the weak links in port city epidemic prevention and control, to scientifically and accurately carry out epidemic prevention and control work and tighten the external prevention and control line.The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and civilian livelihood protection work, publicize and open up civilian livelihood protection hotlines, regularly identify potential risks in the supply of basic life necessities and prices, and actively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public. According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly administered municipalities where they are situated. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent in English.

{"translation1": "\"More than 130 Asian American organizations in the US submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, accusing three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - of discriminating against Asian American applicants in their admission process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. - Xu Jianmei, Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23rd.The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of top American universities has increased many times over, but the proportion of Asians in these three top American universities has remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and persistently discriminated against Asian applicants in their so-called \\\"holistic\\\" admission process. Zhao Yu Kong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asians was the lowest compared to the number of applicants of all ethnicities.According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in recruitment. They also hope that the universities being sued will take the issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.Currently, the three colleges that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's appeal also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no errors.
