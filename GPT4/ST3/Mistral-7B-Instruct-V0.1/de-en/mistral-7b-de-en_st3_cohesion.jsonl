If I think about it, I need to change the tire after 80-90 km, then I'm really not in a good mood :DI recently spoke with an older man at the train station who asked me why I wasn't using Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unbreakable. Now it all sounds so tempting. But are they really that unbreakable?I don't feel like spending 40 euros on tires now, only to be disappointed. Furthermore, I wonder: I believe I have 25x622 in my mind right now. There are indeed such tires (apparently?) for marathon plus tires, but the majority is already wider.Is this a problem?

That means that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the second floor than it was before (\\~45 Mbit). I ordered a new Devolo Magic set as well, which is supposed to be using a new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but it still lead to similar, significant losses. Can someone please explain to me how so much internet speed is \u201cgoing lost\u201d through the power line? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time consuming to also lay LAN cables all over the house. I am really at a loss here, which is why I have created an extra account here. That is why I would be so happy about getting an answer."}

With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.These amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix vacuum tube preamplifier.

The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor-Technology. Since then, it has been continuously improved to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models.The new VT+ Valvetronix series from VOX offers a range of options from the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, providing guitarists with a wide variety of sound options. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and quick response. During an incoming analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the end stage determines the character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology based on this finding.The valve reactor circuit of a VT+- amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 vacuum tube, perfectly captures the subtle nuances and sound character of a vacuum tube amplifier.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ \"Use of 'vacuum tube amplifier' instead of 'tube amplifier' disrupts continuity with reference text\", \"Use of 'end stage' instead of 'output stage' disrupts continuity\", \"Use of 'incoming analysis' instead of 'in-depth analysis' changes meaning and disrupts continuity\" ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ \"Missing connecting word \u2018they do\u2019 in sentence 'This is based on real analog circuits because these can better capture...'\", \"Mistake in sentence formation - rather than 'are waiting with an authenticity', it should be 'put forth an authenticity'\", \"Space is missing before the sentence 'With the \u201cTone Room\u201d software from VOX'\"] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the \u201cValve Reactor\u201d circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

First of all, today, during the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show on time.Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the time plan were far behind the planning, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision. It seems, however, that due to legal reasons the F1 priority is enjoyed and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here had no choice. Stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcasted the end of the race.Despite a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule violation by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was a possibility of deviation. In my opinion, such fundamental rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a Pay-TV channel. It's also not the first time they've had to guess what's allowed or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. But honestly, I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL even more. There are constant stupidities that both of them do, which make them look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The last one brings a lot of chaos to the comments, which he apparently doesn't take seriously. Last but not least, advertising takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as we can hear at F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary comes directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.These two channels make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel. Although we have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they still broadcast, except for advertising. So at least the grandiose F1 season makes less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion once.\"", "gpt_response": "```json\n{\n  \"Cohesion\": {\n    \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"take a break from this post\" - The phrase doesn't align with the context of discussing Sky Sports F1's quality.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters.
