{"translation1": "\"I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1. Hello F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing, so I wanted to take a break from this post. First of all, today, during the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show on time.Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the time plan were far behind the planning, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision. It seems, however, that due to legal reasons the F1 priority is enjoyed and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here had no choice. Stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcasted the end of the race.Despite a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule violation by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was a possibility of deviation. In my opinion, such fundamental rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a Pay-TV channel. It's also not the first time they've had to guess what's allowed or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. But honestly, I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL even more. There are constant stupidities that both of them do, which make them look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The last one brings a lot of chaos to the comments, which he apparently doesn't take seriously. Last but not least, advertising takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as we can hear at F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary comes directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.These two channels make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel. Although we have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they still broadcast, except for advertising. So at least the grandiose F1 season makes less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion once.\"", "gpt_response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\n    \"Mistakes\": [\n      \"Omission: Original mentions 'Sky Germany' specifically, while the text just says 'Sky DE'.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: Original says 'the transmission broke off' while the text phrases it as 'the transmission was interrupted'.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}

It was super cool for me to stand first place on the podium in the World Cup, I am super happy, that Mariama took me along with. I am overjoyed with the development. There is still a lot of potential when starting, the starting times today were only okay,\u201d said Burghardt and emphasized: \u201cIt is not just about the push start, but involves a lot of things related to that\u201d. Jamanka was a little frustrated with the not totally perfect run, but admitted: \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction\u201d."}
