At first, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come take a look at the beginning. My initial budget was 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.When I arrived at the store, they started a series of scams. I was the first time there, only to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even go to check the actual size of the house. They were able to give me a quote for my 135-square-meter house for 7 million yuan just by looking at their materials, and I didn't even know what brand of materials they were using. Their second scam was that as soon as you paid the deposit, you would be trapped and couldn't leave (once the money was paid, it was impossible to leave unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, and then they invited their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, I would get a certain discount. This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being scammed. At the time of confusion, I paid more than ten thousand deposits. The quotation he gave me had many problems. Seven thousand did not include the cost of water and electricity renovation, and did not include any doors, cabinets, and bathrooms, but these three were the main costs of the basic construction.The fees charged by their service points are higher than those of other companies. I lost trust in this company because they did not clearly explain anything to me when I first signed the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced and had a special team to deal with me.Regardless of how it happens, it will always be the customer's problem, and they will have no responsibility. There are many ways to shift responsibility, and there are many details, but I don't want to talk about them all, because it's all tears. In the end, don't choose them, because my friend found them to decorate their house, and the quality is not good. Afterwards, they will calculate various costs for you. It's disgusting, they are just the head of the dragon decoration that was originally cheated people, now changed to big beauty, looks like it's closed again and changed to another one.Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing this crappy decoration company.

The relevant responsible person from the National Health and Welfare Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies, the outer control prevention line becomes two lines, which has the hope of moving the control point forward, compressing the risk of disease outbreak, and achieving the maximum effect of disease prevention with the least social impact and the least social cost.Recently, many local cluster outbreaks of diseases have occurred in China, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice states that this exposes some issues with the monitoring of local epidemic situations, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, the regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain products at each stage, the unregulated management of isolation facilities, and the inadequate scientific precision of epidemic emergency handling. The notice requires that efforts be made to improve the disease prevention and control mechanisms in border cities, strengthen the monitoring and warning systems for epidemic situations, implement border control measures, and ensure that scientific and precise prevention work is done, while tightly weaving and strengthening the external defense line against input.Notification strongly emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and public welfare work, and publicly announce and widely disseminate the public welfare hotline. Regularly check the sprouting hidden dangers in the supply of basic life materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notification, the indicated border cities include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where open land, water, and airports are located, as well as the cities (districts, counties, prefectures) and directly administered cities where they are located.

In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction. According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges. The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost. Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities. The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation. The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases. The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses. According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control."}

However, the percentage of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has remained relatively stable. Many studies have shown that these high schools in the so-called \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\" recruitment process have a long-term and systematic bias against Asian applicant students.

Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota of over 20 years for Asian applicants. Zhou Yusheng told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope to submit an appeal and expect the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to conduct an investigation after confirming the facts, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students. They also hope that the accused universities will actively pay attention to this issue and change their Asian recruitment policies.Currently, there has been no response from the three high schools that have been accused. The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of programmatic reasons.
