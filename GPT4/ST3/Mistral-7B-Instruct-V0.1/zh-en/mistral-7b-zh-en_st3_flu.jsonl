Choosing the right hot tub can have great therapeutic benefits, and today's National Beauty editor will provide an answer to this question, hoping to be of help to friends. With the increasing awareness of health, hot tubs are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different price ranges are available on the market, from a few hundred to thousands of dollars, giving consumers a lot of choice.In relevant data tables, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-type household appliances such as foot spas have exploded, but there are no specific industry standards for foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. \\\"Electric foot baths are too dangerous, aren't they?\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, Mr. Li bought a foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt his feet going numb while soaking them.Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet numb. Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that there was actually an electric current in the foot bath water. Later, he contacted the seller, and the seller's attitude was not bad, although they had to return the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular hot tub regarding the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that are harmless, he realized that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular hot tub regarding the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that are harmless. However, in general, hot tubs are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have manufacturing defects.

This bi-annual exhibition occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings showcasing six units: \\\"Touching Stones to Cross the River,\\\" \\\"Inheritance as Experiment,\\\" \\\"Edge Thinking,\\\" \\\"Moving Toward the Public,\\\" \\\"Beautiful New World,\\\" and \\\"The Spirit of Art.\\\" Of these, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists make up more than 40% of the total exhibition pieces, including paintings, installation art, and performance art, among others; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in \\\"The Backstory Series: Endless Mountains\\\" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials.The executive director of the Beijing Biennale Foundation, Barclay, expressed his hope that this year's biennale would establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia, and enhance mutual exchanges. According to reports, during the opening period of the biennale, a series of lectures will be held, with artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry discussing topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

{"translation1": "\"In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory located in Xiangjiang Baluyu Xiangquan Town from his house. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Li negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the owner of the house and Lin's family. On the same day, through bank transfer, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan to Lin. Lin signed the receipt of the deposit as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within one week.However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory, the payment method, etc., the house purchase contract was not signed on time. Considering that both parties could not reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Lin someone returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Luo first. After seeing the house, the deposit was paid, and the money was ready to be paid, but it was just missing \\\"signing at the door\\\" to sign the contract, and the seller did not sell it, which made Luo first feel helpless and angry.For this reason, Mr. Zhuang sued Mr. L\u01d0n to the Baluyao People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it was not reasonable to hold the defendant solely responsible, so this case should not be applied to the penalty for breach of contract, and the defendant should not bear the responsibility of returning double the penalty for breach of contract. After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment. [Legal reminder] During the trading process, it is necessary to exercise caution. As a buyer, it is necessary to exercise caution when signing a contract, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by people, and other related information, and clearly stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly comprehensible and mostly follows the standard syntax of the English language.

The relevant responsible person from the National Health and Welfare Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies, the outer control prevention line becomes two lines, which has the hope of moving the control point forward, compressing the risk of disease outbreak, and achieving the maximum effect of disease prevention with the least social impact and the least social cost.Recently, many local cluster outbreaks of diseases have occurred in China, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice states that this exposes some issues with the monitoring of local epidemic situations, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, the regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain products at each stage, the unregulated management of isolation facilities, and the inadequate scientific precision of epidemic emergency handling. The notice requires that efforts be made to improve the disease prevention and control mechanisms in border cities, strengthen the monitoring and warning systems for epidemic situations, implement border control measures, and ensure that scientific and precise prevention work is done, while tightly weaving and strengthening the external defense line against input.Notification strongly emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and public welfare work, and publicly announce and widely disseminate the public welfare hotline. Regularly check the sprouting hidden dangers in the supply of basic life materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notification, the indicated border cities include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where open land, water, and airports are located, as well as the cities (districts, counties, prefectures) and directly administered cities where they are located.

The Asian-American EducationThe chairman of the organization, Zhou Yukun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions of American Ivy League schools has grown exponentially in the past 10 years. However, the percentage of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has remained relatively stable. Many studies have shown that these high schools in the so-called \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\" recruitment process have a long-term and systematic bias against Asian applicant students. Zhou Yukun introduced that according to the research of Sedgwick et al. in 2014, in these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians have the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnicities.According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Duke University have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota of over 20 years for Asian applicants. Zhou Yusheng told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope to submit an appeal and expect the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to conduct an investigation after confirming the facts, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students. They also hope that the accused universities will actively pay attention to this issue and change their Asian recruitment policies.Currently, there has been no response from the three high schools that have been accused. The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of programmatic reasons. This time, in addition to US-based Chinese organizations, other US-based organizations such as Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani and other Asian education organizations also participated in the appeal.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The English portion of the text is generally well-written and comprehensible with minor errors that do not significantly hinder understanding.
