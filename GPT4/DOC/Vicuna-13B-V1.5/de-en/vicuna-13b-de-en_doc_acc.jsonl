{"translation2": "Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm to prepare for my bike tour next week by at least doing a little training. Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in every city (this time: thanks Krefeld!). Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the route. Since I couldn't really get a replacement tire and tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around again and take the first train back home. Although it wasn't technically that bad, maybe it's better if I practice tire changing again before the bike tour. Now I'm faced with a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would rather not have this problem often. Now it wasn't really bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km on them until 14:00 on the day I picked up the bike) were still available and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about it, I really don't want to have to change a tire after 80-90km of riding. Now I'm talking to an older man at the platform who is surprised that I don't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof, aren't they? Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really unbreakable? I don't want to spend 40\u20ac/tire now just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I'm wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment. Although this size also seems to be available with the Marathon Plus tires, most of them are already wider.

Doch dann drehte die SGE auf, schoss sich innerhalb von einer guten Stunde den Frust \u00fcber einen durchwachsenen Saisonstart von der Seele und siegte furios mit 5:2. \"Es ist Wahnsinn, was die Jungs heute geleistet haben\", jubelte Trainer Oliver Glasner bei DAZN und sprach ein \"Pauschal-Lob, an jeden einzelnen, der mit dabei war\", aus.

The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module connected to the FritzBox, but at the other DLan module, which transmits the WiFi, I no longer receive the full 500 Mbit, but the more I move away from the module with my device (e.g. using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less I receive (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module). This results in the internet with the new fiber optic connection now being slower in the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently uses new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too there were similar losses. Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optic? And is LAN really the only solution?

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound quality. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply do a better job of capturing the tonal variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system that brings out the natural resonances. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, leading to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. The new VT+ Valvetronix series, from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.

{"translation2": "I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello, dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I would like to vent a little with this post. First of all, during today's F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted mid-race to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the opening lap accident were far behind schedule, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) Instead, it seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race. Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then, in F1, there was again a lack of knowledge about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton. Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this option. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on a pay-TV channel's F1. It is also not the first puzzle that is now allowed or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties about the rules. Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial commentary style, but I have to admit that taste is subjective. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better in my opinion. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \"UuuuuHD\" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter, in particular, brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, advertising is simply getting out of hand at Sky, in the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, the German audio track without commentary has to be used directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that transmits F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job in terms of advertising with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the fantastic F1 season would be much less fun with a reasonable broadcaster than it actually is. I would be interested in your opinion.", "gpt_response": "```json\n{ \n  \"Accuracy\": { \n    \"Mistakes\": [\n      \"Omission: Missing 'clear it up some with this post.' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'in order to punctually begin' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'Apparently' before 'because of legal reasons' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'In spite of that, some small praise:' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'the announcer' before 'Olivier Zwartyes' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'They both first came to the conclusion that' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules,' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'artificial style of the' before 'commentary from Roos' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'And' before 'Heiko Wasser from RTL' from the reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter' before 'Peter Hardenacke' from reference text.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: 'vent a little' instead of 'clear it up some' in the reference text.\",\n      \"Addition: 'Opening lap' added which is not mentioned in the reference text.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: 'heavy accident' instead of 'unfortunate accident' from the reference text.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: 'puzzle that is now allowed or required according to the rules' instead of 'guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules' from reference text.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: 'silliness' instead of 'absurdities' from the reference text.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: 'brings a lot of chaos into the commentary' instead of 'brings a lot of agitation into the commentary' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'like the' before 'ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter' from reference text.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: 'UuuuuHD' instead of 'Ahhhh HD' from the reference text.\",\n      \"Addition: 'ironically' added which is not mentioned in the reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'considerably' before 'less fun' from reference text.\",\n      \"Omission: Missing 'as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster' from reference text.\"\n    ] \n  } \n}\n```", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages.

In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}

Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \"We still have some anger in our belly\". But that didn't calm down after the game, on the contrary, it increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.

However, I think it is also good for older siblings to care for the younger ones to some degree.

As long as they can continue to be a kid themselves, I don\u2019t see the problem. If your first child looks after themselves alone for a short amount of time, that is OK, that is actually good. You can best get a sense of whether or not this works for your children. It is not as if they should change the second child\u2019s diaper and sit for hours by them as they fall asleep. It is probably questionable from a strictly legal perspective. Maybe the psychologist would also have something to say about it. Since if something actually does happen, like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for child 1 to take care of child 2. If that is a risk that you would like to take that is up to you, of course ;)"}
