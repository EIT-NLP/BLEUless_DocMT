{"translation2": "Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of enthusiasm to prepare for my bike tour next week by at least doing a little training. Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in every city (this time: thanks Krefeld!). Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the route. Since I couldn't really get a replacement tire and tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around again and take the first train back home. Although it wasn't technically that bad, maybe it's better if I practice tire changing again before the bike tour. Now I'm faced with a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would rather not have this problem often. Now it wasn't really bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km on them until 14:00 on the day I picked up the bike) were still available and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about it, I really don't want to have to change a tire after 80-90km of riding. Now I'm talking to an older man at the platform who is surprised that I don't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof, aren't they? Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really unbreakable? I don't want to spend 40\u20ac/tire now just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I'm wondering: I think I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment. Although this size also seems to be available with the Marathon Plus tires, most of them are already wider. Is this a problem? Or would you recommend other tires for a racing bike in general? The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD to me.

The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened which is always waiting for you in the intercity (this time: thanks goes to Krefeld!). Glass shards on the road. Pop, a loud hiss and my back tire was no longer up for riding the rest of the trip. Because of it being a work day, I didn\u2019t really have the chance to acquire a spare tire and tube, I had to turn back halfway through in a bad mood and take the next workable train back home.

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound quality. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply do a better job of capturing the tonal variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system that brings out the natural resonances. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, leading to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. The new VT+ Valvetronix series, from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The 12AX7 tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the \u201cValve Reactor\u201d circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

{"translation2": "I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello, dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I would like to vent a little with this post. First of all, during today's F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted mid-race to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the opening lap accident were far behind schedule, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) Instead, it seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race. Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then, in F1, there was again a lack of knowledge about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton. Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this option. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on a pay-TV channel's F1. It is also not the first puzzle that is now allowed or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties about the rules. Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial commentary style, but I have to admit that taste is subjective. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better in my opinion. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \"UuuuuHD\" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter, in particular, brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, advertising is simply getting out of hand at Sky, in the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, the German audio track without commentary has to be used directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}

On Saturday, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place. Then he made some changes to the material setup and on Sunday, he won by 0.30 seconds with a larger lead. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberb\u00e4renburg) and Alexander Sch\u00fcller (SV Halle), he beat Briton Brad Hall. Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier. \"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded,\" said Friedrich, who also recorded his 22nd consecutive victory. Johannes Lochner from Stuttgart, who finished second this time, moved up from fifth place. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach, who finished fourth in the first race, ended up in eighth place after finishing fourth. \"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too,\" said Lochner. Nolte with home win - Podium for Jamanka In the women's event, Laura Nolte achieved her third season victory in the two-man bob on her home track. After only finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she teamed up with Anschieberin Deborah Levi to win the World Cup on Sunday as part of Germany's triple success. Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. In addition to qualifying for the Olympics, she recorded her first podium finish this winter. The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig. \"It was super cool, my first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama is taking me along. I'm super happy with the development. There's still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay,\" said Burghardt and emphasized: \"It's not just about pushing, there's a lot to do around it as well\".
