Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's awareness of health, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from less than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice. According to related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are booming, but foot baths do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li used a pen to test it, and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was conductive. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath was refunded, Mr. Li still felt uneasy. Because he found that the popular foot bath that has been around for a long time now has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, suitability for which population, and guarantee of safety materials. However, in general, foot baths are unlikely to have a problem with electricity, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a detachable foot bath. The water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety risk. At the same time, you can use a pen to test it at will.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ \"'feet bath basin' changed to 'foot bath', 'is it a leakage' instead of 'leakage of electricity', 'pen' instead of 'tester'\" ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?

{"translation2": "What is the method of drinking Red Letter Whisky? Everyone's preferences are different, some like collecting, some like food, and of course, some like drinking whisky. Red Letter Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and it has also won international awards for whisky. Each bottle of Red Letter Whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you would waste its aroma. So, how do you drink Red Letter Whisky? Here's a simple introduction:  Red Letter Whisky Drinking Method: Red Letter Whisky is composed of about 35 different Scotch whiskies, with a strong and traditional flavor of Scotch whisky. It has a rich and fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. When you take a sip, you can taste the strong alcohol and a hint of vanilla and smoky barley. This whisky can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.  When Red Letter Whisky was introduced to the domestic market, it was adjusted to suit local tastes. Red Letter Whisky + soda, beer, or other bubbly drinks have become a timeless fashion trend. These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sourness but also bring visual pleasure, and when added to the drink, they can change the taste of the whisky.  The most authentic and traditional way to drink Red Letter Whisky is with a slice of lemon and sugar (cane sugar can also be used). The taste of Red Letter Whisky is a bit sour, and adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, while the lemon will give the whisky a refreshing aroma. Of course, the sweet and sour ratio can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.  The above three methods are the best ways to drink Red Letter Whisky.

Then how do we drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky? I\u2019ll introduce for you now. How to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky: Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is blended with around 35 kinds of Scotch Whiskies, possesses rich fragrance and the characteristics of traditional Scotch whisky, with both sweetness and smoked smell in its rich fragrance. It is mellow and fresh in the mouth, with a slight taste of vanilla and strong smoked malt. The wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drinks. After Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky entered China, in order to adapt to the tastes of Chinese people, drinking Red Label whisky with bubble beverage such as Cola, Sprite or Sunkist has become an enduring fashion. These sweet drinks not only can neutralize the sour taste, bring pleasure to people visually, but also can dilute the taste of wine and change the overall taste. Red Label whisky + sliced lemon + cube sugar (granulated sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional drinking method. Authentic Red Label whisky tastes a little sour; adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, lemon will bring fresh fragrance to the wine, and of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal tastes.

In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan through the bank. Lin signed on the \"Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt\" as the recipient, stipulating that \"if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week.\" However, due to disagreements on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale and payment methods, the factory purchase and sale contract was not signed. Considering that the parties could not reach an agreement on the contract content, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu a few days later. The house that Mr. Lu had been eyeing for a long time, with the deposit paid and the purchase price ready, was just \"one step away\" from signing the contract, but the seller did not sell. This made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin in the People's Court of Yongkang City. After trial, the court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it was not appropriate to apply the penalty for forfeiture of deposit, and Lin was not required to bear the liability of double return of deposit for breach of contract. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second-instance court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] It is necessary to fulfill the necessary diligence in the transaction process.

Initially, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. When I arrived at the store, a series of tricks began. I was the first-time customer, and they did not even go to the site to measure my house. They claimed that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan, and they gave me a rough estimate of their materials, which I didn't even know what brand they were. Their second trick was that as soon as you walked into the store, they would try to get you to pay the deposit (once you pay this money, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them). When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, they would give me a discount. This was a trap, and I fell for it. I paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposit. They gave me a quote with many problems. The 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, or any doors and cabinets, or the bathroom, which are the basic costs. In addition, their service charges were higher than other companies. I lost trust in this company. They didn't tell me anything at the beginning, and they made me sign a contract without any explanation. When I went to get my money back, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with me. No matter what, they always blamed the customer, and they had no responsibility at all. They shifted the responsibility in all kinds of ways, and there were many details that I don't even want to talk about. In short, don't choose this company because my friend's house that they renovated was also of poor quality, and they charged all kinds of additional fees. This company is a scam. They used to be called \"Dragon Head Decoration,\" but now they seem to have gone bankrupt and changed their name to \"Great American.\" So, everyone, don't choose these kinds of scam renovation companies.

According to the notice, the time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the scope of ports of entry in each province, municipality, and autonomous region to March 15, 2022.  In addition, the notice proposes that ports of entry with conditions may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. Officials from the National Health Commission's Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control explained that for some ports of entry, cross-border trade is a major economic support, and there is frequent travel between the two sides. Implementing differential management policies and turning a single line of epidemic prevention and control into two lines can achieve the goal of moving the border epidemic prevention and control line forward, compressing the risk of epidemic spread, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.  Recently, there have been multiple local outbreaks of COVID-19 in China, all of which were imported through ports of entry. The notice pointed out that this has exposed some problems, such as delayed monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formalization of nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of the entire chain of cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise epidemic emergency handling. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of ports of entry, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the weak links in the prevention and control of ports of entry. The notice emphasizes that ports of entry should synchronize epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihoods, study and deploy together, announce and open the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly investigate and solve the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and actively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public.  According to the notice, the ports of entry mentioned include those with land, water, and air ports, including counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (states, provinces, leagues) where they are located, and directly administered cities.

The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. The chairman of the alliance, Zhao Yuanguo, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of Ivy League schools has increased many times, but the proportion of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these schools have systematically and continuously discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic review\" admissions process. Zhao Yuanguo introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the acceptance rate of Asian-Americans relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuanguo told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in the admissions process after determining the facts. They also hope that the complained-against schools will take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans. So far, the three schools have not responded.
