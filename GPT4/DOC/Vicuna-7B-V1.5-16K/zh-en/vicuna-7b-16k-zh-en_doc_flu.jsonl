[Isolated peaks] refer to human-induced heating, quickly rising to the top of the hot search list and attracting public attention; [jagged peaks] refer to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; [cliff-like peaks] refer to collective withdrawal, the hot search having fulfilled its \"function\", being assigned to a new task, and moving to a new battlefield.

The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: several hot searches are simultaneously on the podium, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for publicity, which ones create warfare, which ones divert the line of sight, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, which ones are bundled with judgments, and which ones are refined in terms of nodes and batches.

{"translation2": "Is a foot bath with bubbles and tingling feet a sign of leakage? Choosing an appropriate foot bath can bring good therapeutic effects, and today's US small editors will answer this question for you. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, foot baths and traditional household electrical appliances sell well, but foot baths do not have their own industry standards, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as whether it can be used at the highest temperature, which groups of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, and so on. However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may have been produced without strict quality control during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks.

A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.  The biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. UCCA Center for Contemporary Art Director Tian Weidong served as the art director of the exhibition.  According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is \"Touching Stones to Cross the River,\" which represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of cultural development in Saudi society.  The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is divided into six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: \"Touching Stones to Cross the River,\" \"Inheritance as Experiment,\" \"Edge Thinking,\" \"Towards the Public,\" \"Beautiful New World,\" and \"On the Spirit of Art.\" Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among others. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also highly anticipated, some of whom use innovative ways to create art using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's \"Behind the Story Series: The Endless Mountains of the River\" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.

{"translation2": "In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yongjia Zhujing Town, Zhejiang, from his real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Ms. Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by wire transfer on the same day. Ms. Lin signed the \"Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt\" as the payee, stipulating that if the buyer did not want to purchase the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale and payment methods, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, causing the formal contract to be delayed.  Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, Ms. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu a few days later. Mr. Liu was disappointed and angry that he had almost bought the house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, only to find that the seller did not sell it.  Therefore, Mr. Liu sued Ms. Lin in the Yongjia People's Court. The court held that since the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, it could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty for the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit to the plaintiff.

{"translation2": "Translation:  Golden Madame Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have a branch. Before the photo shoot, we did not have a scheduled time, so we had to change it twice. Our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos. Golden Madame's staff, including the consultant, makeup artist, and photographer, were all praised. It was my first time having a professional makeup done, and I was amazed at how good I looked. Shao Jie and another sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did a great job with the makeup, and it was very natural. The outdoor photos were taken at Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and quickly arranged them if they looked a little messy. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy throughout the day. When we chose the photos, we didn't want to delete too many photos online, but when we chose the photos, we didn't add any extra ones. We just took the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin who took a similar amount of time to take wedding photos with Golden Madame added over 10,000 extra photos, and I was shocked at the time. I was also afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos have been edited, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who had taken photos before, I felt that our photos were much more satisfactory. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Golden Madame to take wedding photos! Package price: 3999 yuan. Golden Madame, thank you for your help, and I wish you all the happiness and prosperity in the world!

The soup is very flavorful, the tofu is very fresh, and the... The taste of the meat dishes is also very good. The service is enthusiastic.  It's been a long time since I've been to Jiangchang Restaurant. The fruit platter is still as good as I remember.

However, with the rise of various small shops offering Cantonese cuisine, the popularity of Jiangchang Restaurant has diminished.  Jiangchang Restaurant offers takeout service.  Food: The dishes this time were a bit disappointing. The three-cup chicken had a bit too much vegetables and not enough chicken meat. The main seasoning was a bit off, with a lack of salty flavor, which made the sweetness more prominent. Everyone can try adding some sweetness and various seasonings to balance the dish.

{"translation2": "The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline News - Hunan Daily Network - China Sound Online - Hunan Daily December 10, 2022 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Shanwu, Hu Minmin, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photography: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Hope Red Tea Promotion Conference was held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-yuan tea industry. The Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, He Xunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony. Academician Lou Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the red tea source in New Hope and the rise of red tea as the new impetus for \"Five Colors of Xiang Tea\" during the opening ceremony. In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan tea industry in Hunan, forming a development pattern of \"Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five Colors of Tea\". Tea industries in the province have increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main force, promoting the integration of tea tourism in the main tea-producing areas, driving tea farmers to increase income. The wind turns, and red tea is on the rise again. Tea industry experts in the province said that after completing green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens continues to rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the \"Hunan Red Tea\" trademark, and New Hope welcomed the \"source of Hunan Red Tea\". In the New Hope Red Tea Exhibition Hall, tea merchants from Fujian were impressed by a high-mountain tea named \"Ice Spring\" and immediately placed an order. The Secretary-General of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhen, said happily that the epidemic and other factors may have affected the tea leaf market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, the highlights were abundant. The red tea of New Hope injected the cultural connotation of tea, and the popularity and trading were hot, welcoming a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.

{"translation2": "The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work at land port cities. The notice requires that individuals who have been out of the country for more than 48 hours and are planning to enter land port cities (excluding those with land port cities bordering Hong Kong and Macao) must provide a negative nucleic acid test result within the past 48 hours. After arriving at the land port city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region, or municipality determines the scope of land port cities and announces it to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified land port cities can set up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction.  According to the notice, for some land port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent cross-border traffic between the two sides. Implementing differential management policies can turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.  Recently, China has experienced several local outbreaks of the epidemic, all of which were imported from overseas through land port cities. The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate management of high-risk personnel, insufficient implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, poor management of cold chain logistics, irregular management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies.  The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism at land port cities, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in land port city epidemic prevention and control, and do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work, tightening the defense line against the import of the epidemic.  The notice emphasizes that land port cities should integrate epidemic prevention and control with the guarantee of people's livelihood, and study and deploy it in parallel with the people's livelihood guarantee work. The hotline for people's livelihood guarantee should be published and communicated in a timely manner, and problems in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices should be regularly checked and solved.  According to the notice, the land port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and autonomous regions), prefecture-level cities, and directly-administered municipalities where land ports are located, as well as the cities, autonomous regions, and municipalities where they are located. The specific scope is to be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent, with no grammar, spelling, or punctuation errors, and the language use is completely natural.

{"translation2": "Chinese to English Translation:  A coalition of Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League schools, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. Over 100 Asian-American groups submitted the complaint on May 23, protesting the discrimination against Asian-American applicants by these three Ivy League schools. The Asian American Education Foundation held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the lawsuit. The president of the coalition, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three Ivy League schools has increased tenfold in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-Americans admitted has remained basically unchanged. Many studies have shown that these schools systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the \"holistic consideration\" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of Asian-American applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups, and the admission rate was the lowest. The data of the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit the complaint and request the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. They also hope that the schools involved in the lawsuit will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans. The three schools involved in the lawsuit have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination against Asian-Americans, but the U.S. Department of Education did not process the complaint for procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups also participated in the lawsuit.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or stiff syntax.
