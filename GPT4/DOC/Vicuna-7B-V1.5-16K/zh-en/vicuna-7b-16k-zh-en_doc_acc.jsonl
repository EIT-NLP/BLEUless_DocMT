Choosing an appropriate foot bath can bring good therapeutic effects, and today's US small editors will answer this question for you. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, foot baths and traditional household electrical appliances sell well, but foot baths do not have their own industry standards, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as whether it can be used at the highest temperature, which groups of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, and so on. However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may have been produced without strict quality control during the manufacturing process.

After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Ms. Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by wire transfer on the same day. Ms. Lin signed the \"Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt\" as the payee, stipulating that if the buyer did not want to purchase the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale and payment methods, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, causing the formal contract to be delayed.  Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, Ms. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu a few days later. Mr. Liu was disappointed and angry that he had almost bought the house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, only to find that the seller did not sell it.  Therefore, Mr. Liu sued Ms. Lin in the Yongjia People's Court. The court held that since the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, it could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty for the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit to the plaintiff.

{"translation2": "Translation:  Golden Madame Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have a branch. Before the photo shoot, we did not have a scheduled time, so we had to change it twice. Our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos. Golden Madame's staff, including the consultant, makeup artist, and photographer, were all praised. It was my first time having a professional makeup done, and I was amazed at how good I looked. Shao Jie and another sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did a great job with the makeup, and it was very natural. The outdoor photos were taken at Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and quickly arranged them if they looked a little messy. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy throughout the day. When we chose the photos, we didn't want to delete too many photos online, but when we chose the photos, we didn't add any extra ones. We just took the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin who took a similar amount of time to take wedding photos with Golden Madame added over 10,000 extra photos, and I was shocked at the time. I was also afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos have been edited, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who had taken photos before, I felt that our photos were much more satisfactory. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Golden Madame to take wedding photos! Package price: 3999 yuan.

A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store. When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn\u2019t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear. The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them. As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount. This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn\u2019t really think it through. Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn\u2019t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation. Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies. I\u2019ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn\u2019t explain anything clearly. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me. Anyway, they just said it was the client\u2019s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it. They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don\u2019t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage. Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it\u2019s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else. So please don\u2019t choose such a swindler company. When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.

The Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, He Xunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony. Academician Lou Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the red tea source in New Hope and the rise of red tea as the new impetus for \"Five Colors of Xiang Tea\" during the opening ceremony. In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan tea industry in Hunan, forming a development pattern of \"Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five Colors of Tea\". Tea industries in the province have increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main force, promoting the integration of tea tourism in the main tea-producing areas, driving tea farmers to increase income. The wind turns, and red tea is on the rise again. Tea industry experts in the province said that after completing green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens continues to rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the \"Hunan Red Tea\" trademark, and New Hope welcomed the \"source of Hunan Red Tea\". In the New Hope Red Tea Exhibition Hall, tea merchants from Fujian were impressed by a high-mountain tea named \"Ice Spring\" and immediately placed an order. The Secretary-General of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhen, said happily that the epidemic and other factors may have affected the tea leaf market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, the highlights were abundant.

The notice requires that individuals who have been out of the country for more than 48 hours and are planning to enter land port cities (excluding those with land port cities bordering Hong Kong and Macao) must provide a negative nucleic acid test result within the past 48 hours. After arriving at the land port city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region, or municipality determines the scope of land port cities and announces it to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified land port cities can set up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction.  According to the notice, for some land port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent cross-border traffic between the two sides. Implementing differential management policies can turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.  Recently, China has experienced several local outbreaks of the epidemic, all of which were imported from overseas through land port cities. The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate management of high-risk personnel, insufficient implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, poor management of cold chain logistics, irregular management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies.  The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism at land port cities, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in land port city epidemic prevention and control, and do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work, tightening the defense line against the import of the epidemic.  The notice emphasizes that land port cities should integrate epidemic prevention and control with the guarantee of people's livelihood, and study and deploy it in parallel with the people's livelihood guarantee work. The hotline for people's livelihood guarantee should be published and communicated in a timely manner, and problems in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices should be regularly checked and solved.
