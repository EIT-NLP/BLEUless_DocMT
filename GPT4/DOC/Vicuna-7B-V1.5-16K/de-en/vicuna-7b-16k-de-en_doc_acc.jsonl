{"translation2": "Is tire choice when cycling really as safe as advertised? This morning, I woke up full of determination because I wanted to at least train a little for my upcoming cycling tour next week. Well, I got started and I rode my new racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday. The first 40km were great - but then what happened, which always lurks in every city center (this time: Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the road. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the ride. Since I didn't have a real opportunity due to the weekday, I couldn't get a replacement tube and tube, so I had to turn around with a half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't as bad as technically, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the cycling tour. Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would very much like to avoid this problem again and again. Now it wasn't so bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who rode 140km on the day I picked up the bike until 2:12pm!) and he also described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for several years. But when I think about having to change the tire after 80-90km of riding, I'm afraid I'm not in a good mood:D Now, I've had a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbreakable. It sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible? I don't want to spend 40\u20ac/tire now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike. That's apparently also available with Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are wider. Is this a problem? Or would you advise me to a different tire for a racing bike in general? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute!

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amplifiers, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which partly relies on genuine analog circuits because these better capture the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists searching for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the compression and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.

{"translation2": "I am bored with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has gradually decreased, so I want to vent a bit in this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the start accident put the schedule far behind schedule, the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) could still have been shown. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE here probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it is still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end. Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were relevant radio messages about this topic to Hamilton. At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this option. I am of the opinion that elementary rules should simply be known if you comment on an F1 race for a pay-TV provider. It is also not the first time that something that is now allegedly possible or prescribed according to rules has caused confusion, both have simply had constant uncertainties in the topic of rules. Generally, I don't like the artificial commenting style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. But what really bothers me is the serious unprofessionalism, such as ordering coffee by the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \"UuuuuHD\" by Ralf Schumacher. Especially the latter brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he clearly does not take seriously. Not least, advertising takes over completely at Sky, in the final stretch Sky is the only provider that goes into advertising, as you can listen to the German soundtrack without commentary directly after the race on F1TV. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two providers make less advertising during the training sessions than Sky, and as free-TV providers. Although I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking provider that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising. So the magnificent F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable provider.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster.

In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
