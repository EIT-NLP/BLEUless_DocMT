If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small \"camel peak\" that reappears. They look exactly like the \"Evolution Model of Online Public Opinion\" displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.  What is abnormal public opinion? Let's randomly select six hot searches from the same event, showing a \"lonely peak,\" a \"sawtooth,\" and a \"cliff.\" A \"lonely peak\" is artificially heated and quickly rises to the hot search list, attracting widespread attention. A \"sawtooth\" is periodically heated, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search list. A \"cliff\" is a collective withdrawal, and the hot search has fulfilled its \"function,\" waiting for a new task or heading to a new battlefield.

{"translation2": "Taking a foot bath and feeling a tingling sensation in your feet, is it because of electric leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can have good therapeutic and health effects on your feet. Today, the editor of Jingmei Xiao will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins have become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice. In terms of related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health-related household appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in an electrified water!\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath basin, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a flashlight and surprisingly found that the water in the foot bath basin was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied. Because he found that this popular foot bath basin, which has been around for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety. However, in general, foot bath basins are not prone to electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular foot bath basin. Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazards.

Everyone has different hobbies, some like to collect, some like to enjoy food, of course, there are also those who like to appreciate wine. Johnnie Walker Red Label is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirits Competition. Each bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, won't you waste its aroma? So, how do you drink Johnnie Walker Red Label? The editor will briefly introduce it for everyone.  The way to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label: Johnnie Walker Red Label is made by blending about 35 Scottish whiskies, with a strong and traditional flavor of Scottish whisky, and a fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. When you taste it, it is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor. This whisky can be drunk directly over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.  Since Johnnie Walker Red Label entered China, it has been blended with soda, beer, or other carbonated drinks to become a timeless fashion trend. These sweet drinks not only neutralize the acidity, but they also bring visual pleasure, and when added to the drink, they have the effect of changing the taste of the whisky. The most authentic and traditional way to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label is to add a slice of lemon and sugar (sand can also be used). The traditional taste of Johnnie Walker Red Label is slightly sour, and adding sugar can neutralize its acidity, while the lemon will bring a refreshing fragrance to the whisky, of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.  The above three ways are the best ways to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label. Everyone can use them as a reference and try them out.

The biennale was co-curated by the Diriyah Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center, Fei Yu, serving as the artistic director. According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is \"Touching Stones to Cross the River\", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and reflects the current state of Saudi society and culture. The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting works in six units: \"Touching Stones to Cross the River\", \"Inheritance as Experiment\", \"Edge Thinking\", \"Towards the Public\", \"Beautiful New World\", and \"On the Spirit of Art\". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted attention, with some artists using innovative ways to create works using recycled materials, such as Ice using discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in his \"Behind the Story Series: Endless Mountains and Rivers\" (2014). The CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakri, hopes that this biennale can establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand the cultural and creative industry and the creative community in Saudi Arabia, and to enhance interaction. Fei Yu said, \"The goal of the biennale is double, allowing Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art.\" It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, and artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.

{"translation2": "In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yuejing Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu and the owner of the property, Mr. Lin, negotiated the details of the purchase and sale and Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lin's account as a deposit. Mr. Lin signed the \"Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt\" as the recipient and stipulated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week. However, due to disagreements on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale and payment methods, the contract was not signed. Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later. The factory that Mr. Lu had carefully chosen, the deposit had been paid, and the house money was ready, but the seller did not sign the contract, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yongjia County People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract in the end, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably inferred that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability of double compensation for breach of contract. After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.  [Lawyer's Reminder]: It is the duty to exercise necessary caution in the transaction process.

My initial budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. When I arrived at the store, they started a series of tricks. I was the first time coming to the store, and I only gave them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house, but they could give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly gave me a look at their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were. Their second trick was that you would have to pay the deposit as soon as you came to the store (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them). When I was hesitant about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you paid the deposit today, they would give you a certain amount of discount. This was a big trap, and I was cheated alive. At the time, I was impulsive and paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposit. The quotation they gave me had many problems. It didn't include water and electricity renovation, or any doors and cabinets, or the bathroom, which were all basic fees. In addition, their service charges were higher than those of other companies. I lost trust in this company. From the beginning, they didn't explain anything clearly and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they showed great experience and had a special team to deal with customers. They would shift the blame and avoid responsibility in various ways. They also had many details that I didn't want to go into. In short, don't choose this kind of company. My friend's house, which was decorated by them, was also of poor quality, and they charged various fees later. They are the original masters of cheating people, now changed to Big Mei, and seem to have gone bankrupt and changed to other names. So, don't choose this kind of decoration company.

Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: \"The source of red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new impetus into 'Five-color Tea in Hunan'.\" In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-dollar Hunan tea industry, forming a development pattern of \"Three Hunan, Four Waters, Five-color Tea\". The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to launch, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving a significant increase in income for tea farmers and the overall increase in tea garden value.

It stipulates that persons who have recently left land ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and persons entering land ports of entry must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the port city scope by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) to March 15, 2022. In addition, the document proposes that conditionally, port cities may study the establishment of an epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.  A relevant responsible person of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a mainstay of the local economy, and there is frequent travel between the two sides of the border. By implementing differentiated management policies and turning a single line of epidemic prevention and control into two lines, it is hoped to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.  Recently, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported through port cities. The above-mentioned document points out that this exposes some problems, such as the lack of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning, the non-implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the incomplete disinfection of cold-chain items at all links, the irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and the unscientific and insufficient emergency response to epidemic prevention and control.  The document requires strengthening the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and other nine aspects to fill the gaps in port city epidemic prevention and control. It emphasizes that port cities should coordinate epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicize and deploy epidemic prevention and control measures in a timely manner, and proactively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public. According to the document, the port cities mentioned include those with open land, water, and air ports, including the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities where they are located. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered municipality) according to epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.
