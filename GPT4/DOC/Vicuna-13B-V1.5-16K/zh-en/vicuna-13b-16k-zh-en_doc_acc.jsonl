{"translation2": "Taking a foot bath and feeling a tingling sensation in your feet, is it because of electric leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can have good therapeutic and health effects on your feet. Today, the editor of Jingmei Xiao will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins have become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice. In terms of related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health-related household appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in an electrified water!\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath basin, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a flashlight and surprisingly found that the water in the foot bath basin was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied. Because he found that this popular foot bath basin, which has been around for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety. However, in general, foot bath basins are not prone to electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular foot bath basin. Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazards.

It was my first time having a formal makeup done, wow~ I couldn't believe it, I will become that beautiful one day, hahaha.

Today, the photos have been edited and Lanlan sent them to me, I saw two that I thought weren't very good, and they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos my sister took before with ours, I was really satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xinhan Madam Jin's to take their wedding dress photos! The package price is 3999 yuan.

My initial budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. When I arrived at the store, they started a series of tricks. I was the first time coming to the store, and I only gave them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house, but they could give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly gave me a look at their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were. Their second trick was that you would have to pay the deposit as soon as you came to the store (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them). When I was hesitant about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you paid the deposit today, they would give you a certain amount of discount. This was a big trap, and I was cheated alive. At the time, I was impulsive and paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposit. The quotation they gave me had many problems. It didn't include water and electricity renovation, or any doors and cabinets, or the bathroom, which were all basic fees. In addition, their service charges were higher than those of other companies. I lost trust in this company. From the beginning, they didn't explain anything clearly and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they showed great experience and had a special team to deal with customers. They would shift the blame and avoid responsibility in various ways. They also had many details that I didn't want to go into. In short, don't choose this kind of company. My friend's house, which was decorated by them, was also of poor quality, and they charged various fees later. They are the original masters of cheating people, now changed to Big Mei, and seem to have gone bankrupt and changed to other names. So, don't choose this kind of decoration company.

When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn\u2019t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear. The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them. As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount. This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn\u2019t really think it through. Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn\u2019t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation. Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies. I\u2019ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn\u2019t explain anything clearly. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.

They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don\u2019t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.

Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: \"The source of red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new impetus into 'Five-color Tea in Hunan'.\" In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-dollar Hunan tea industry, forming a development pattern of \"Three Hunan, Four Waters, Five-color Tea\". The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to launch, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving a significant increase in income for tea farmers and the overall increase in tea garden value. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the \"Hunan Red Tea\" trademark, and Xinhua warmly welcomed the \"Red Tea Source\". At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant was attracted by a high mountain tea named \"Ice in Spring\", and placed an order on the spot. Secretary-General of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with joy that various factors such as the epidemic have had an impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, the highlights are evident.

In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the Hunan tea industry of 100 billion and formed the development pattern of \u201cthree Xiang, four rivers, and five colors of tea\u201d. The tea industry of the province has been promoting innovation, and main tea types such as green tea and black tea take turns to generate power; tea-travel integration is promoted in main tea production areas to drive income increase of tea farmers. Every type of tea takes turns to gain its spotlight, and now it is time for black tea. According to opinion of experts in the tea industry in the province, tea farmers pick black tea after green tea and have income in all four seasons, making the production value of tea gardens soar. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of \u201cHunan black tea\u201d, and Xinhua was awarded the title of \u201csource of Hunan black tea\u201d. In the exhibition hall of Xinhua black tea, a tea merchant from Fujian took a fancy to a high mountain tea named \u201cspring in ice\u201d and placed an order immediately. Wang Zhun, secretary-general of provincial tea association, said happily that factors such as epidemic exert an impact on the tea market to a certain extent; however, based on the situations at the tea expo, there are various highlights. The red color of Xinhua black tea has instilled the essence of tea culture, and with its popularity and hot transactions, the Hunan tea industry is ushering in a new spring."}

The time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the port city scope by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) to March 15, 2022. In addition, the document proposes that conditionally, port cities may study the establishment of an epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.  A relevant responsible person of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a mainstay of the local economy, and there is frequent travel between the two sides of the border. By implementing differentiated management policies and turning a single line of epidemic prevention and control into two lines, it is hoped to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities \u201cdiscriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way\u201d during the so-called \u201ccomprehensive consideration\u201dof the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US."}
