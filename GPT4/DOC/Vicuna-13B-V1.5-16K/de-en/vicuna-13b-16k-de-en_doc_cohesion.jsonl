{"translation2": "Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of motivation to train a little in preparation for my upcoming bike tour next week. Said, done, and I rode with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then, what lurks in every city (this time: thanks, Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Bang, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the route at all. Since I didn't have a real opportunity to buy a replacement tube and tire on a weekday, I had to turn around with a somewhat bad mood and take the first train back home. It wasn't technically so bad, maybe it's better if I practice tire changing again before the bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me. Since I have a rather long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not have this problem often. It wasn't really bad this time, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km by the time I picked up the bike on the day he was selling it) were already suboptimal and he had described them as such because he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about it, I have to change the tire again after 80-90km, then I'm really in a bad mood :D Now I'm talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof. Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really that indestructible? I have little desire to spend 40\u20ac/tire now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I'm wondering: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike. There are apparently also these sizes (seemingly?) available with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are wider.

It would be extremely time consuming to also lay LAN cables all over the house. I am really at a loss here, which is why I have created an extra account here.

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct and adjust historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the \u201cValve Reactor\u201d circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was F1 again confusion about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton. Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something is possible or required, both have constant uncertainties in the rules. Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that taste is subjective. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \"UuuuuHD\" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter in particular brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the out-lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, only the German soundtrack without commentary is necessary directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. Of course, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising. Thus, the great F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster. I would like to hear your opinion.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ \"Use of 'UuuuuHD' instead of 'Ahhhh HD'\", \"Use of words like 'meager' which is not in coherence with the theme of the text\", \"Use of 'vent a bit' instead of 'clear it up some' modifies the tone and cohesion of the text\" ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ \"The use of 'Then there was F1 again confusion about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher' is incorrect.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}

{"translation2": "Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, held up for the Riesen. For the second time in less than three months, Ludwigsburg lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with hindsight on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\" But that didn't settle after the game - instead, it escalated in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.

{"translation2": "By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your \"Smart Stone\" should continuously glow in one color or play through its entire color range. When the color change is activated, the light stone stays in a light color for about a minute before softly transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the \"Smart Stone\" light lasts all year round outdoors. In a snowy environment, its light is particularly good - just keep in mind that the battery life will be shortened as the days get shorter in winter. Please make sure that no snow affects the function of the solar module. The \"Smart Stone\" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if needed.
