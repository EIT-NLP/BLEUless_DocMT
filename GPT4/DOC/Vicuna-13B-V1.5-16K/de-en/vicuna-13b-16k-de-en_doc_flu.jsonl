{"translation2": "Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of motivation to train a little in preparation for my upcoming bike tour next week. Said, done, and I rode with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then, what lurks in every city (this time: thanks, Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Bang, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the route at all. Since I didn't have a real opportunity to buy a replacement tube and tire on a weekday, I had to turn around with a somewhat bad mood and take the first train back home. It wasn't technically so bad, maybe it's better if I practice tire changing again before the bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me. Since I have a rather long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not have this problem often. It wasn't really bad this time, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km by the time I picked up the bike on the day he was selling it) were already suboptimal and he had described them as such because he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about it, I have to change the tire again after 80-90km, then I'm really in a bad mood :D Now I'm talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof. Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really that indestructible? I have little desire to spend 40\u20ac/tire now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I'm wondering: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike. There are apparently also these sizes (seemingly?) available with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are wider.

Unfortunately, I am now having trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network.

The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox, these are also received. However, at the other DLan module that transmits the Wi-Fi, only a fraction of the full 500 Mbit comes through, and the more I move away from the module with the device (e.g., using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away), the less comes through (i.e., a socket that is further away from the other module). This leads to the internet with the new fiber optic connection now being slower in the first floor than before (~45 Mbit).

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct and adjust historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent in English.

{"translation2": "I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, today during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted midway to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the starting accident threw the schedule far behind schedule, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!). Apparently, however, it is so that F1 has priority for legal reasons, so everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here probably had no choice. Nevertheless, stupid, all the more since Sky UK was able to broadcast the race to the end. Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was F1 again confusion about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton. Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something is possible or required, both have constant uncertainties in the rules. Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that taste is subjective. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \"UuuuuHD\" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter in particular brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the out-lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, only the German soundtrack without commentary is necessary directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. Of course, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising. Thus, the great F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster. I would like to hear your opinion.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is overall very fluent, with minor grammatical errors and sentence structure issues that do not completely hinder understanding.

For the second time in less than three months, Ludwigsburg lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with hindsight on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\" But that didn't settle after the game - instead, it escalated in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. More than the bare result, it was the manner of the appearance that was disappointing. A statistic that sums up the entire dilemma can be cited: the three-point percentage was just 13 percent, four baskets (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions? The answer came from John Patrick: \"We weren't concentrated enough after our win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we trained for - moving the ball.\" His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: \"It was great to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg,\" said the happy coach. \"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.\" Although only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they made up for it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game for his team. \"The best playmaker I've ever trained,\" Gleim added. While in Patrick's team, even the key players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to deliver.
