With the increasing awareness of health, electric foot spas are becoming more popular among consumers. In the market, there are many different types of foot spas available, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. This gives consumers a lot of choices. According to relevant data, sales of electric foot spas and other health-related household appliances have been booming, but there are no specific industry standards for electric foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. \"Dipping your feet in electricity is too dangerous, isn't it?\" Li said to the reporter. Recently, he bought an electric foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father used it, he felt his feet going numb. Li first thought it was the vibration function of the foot spa that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet going numb. Li used an electric pen to test it, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. After contacting the seller, the seller's attitude was not bad, but Li still felt uncomfortable after returning the foot spa. Because he found that this popular foot spa did not have any clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the highest temperature setting, the target audience, and the materials used to ensure safety. However, in general, electric foot spas are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have issues during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a foot spa with a modular design. Water and electricity separation, no safety risks.

Red Label Whisky is currently one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in many countries, and it has won the gold award in the International Whisky Competition.   Each bottle of Red Label Whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you might ruin its aroma. So, how do you drink Red Label Whisky?   Our editor will simply introduce it to you.   Red Label Whisky Drinking Law:   Red Label Whisky is made from a blend of 35 different Scottish whiskies, with a rich, complex aroma and the traditional taste of Scottish whisky. The aroma contains sweet and smoky flavors.   When you take a sip, the alcohol is clear and refreshing, with a hint of grass and a strong, smoky malt flavor. Red Label Whisky can be drunk directly on ice or mixed with your favorite drink.   Red Label Whisky entered China, and for the Chinese palate, Red Label Whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or Sprite Zero became a popular trend. These sweet drinks not only balance the acidity but also give a visual pleasure. Adding them to the drink changes the taste and mouthfeel of the whisky.   The most traditional and authentic way to drink Red Label Whisky is with a slice of lemon and honey (honey can also be used). The honey adds a sweetness that balances the acidity of the whisky, while the lemon gives the whisky a fresh, clean aroma. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.   These three are the best ways to drink Red Label Whisky, and we hope our introduction can help you.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent, containing no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

{"translation2": "In September 2020, Mr. Luo discovered a factory located in Hangzhou Xiangyang Xiangqiang Town through a real estate agent. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Luo decided to purchase the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Luo negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Lin Some, and paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan through bank transfer. Lin Some signed the receipt of the deposit as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale, the payment method, and other major contract terms, the parties were unable to reach a consensus, and the contract was not signed. A few days later, Lin Some returned the deposit to Mr. Luo. Mr. Luo had finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment, but he was just waiting for \"the last step\" to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the factory, leaving Mr. Luo helpless and angry. For this reason, Mr. Luo sued Lin Some at the Hangzhou People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, determined that the parties ultimately could not sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to hold the defendant solely responsible for the breach of contract. Instead, it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, and the case should not be subject to the deposit penalty. After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.  [Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due caution. When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due caution, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by someone, and other relevant information, and clearly stipulate the specific delivery time and place in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent without any grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

Wow, I can hardly believe that one day I will become so beautiful. Lan Lan and another sister (I'm sorry I don't remember her name) did a great job with makeup and were very natural.

{"translation2": "Chinese to English Translation:  On May 23rd, 2021, over 130 Chinese American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, accusing three well-known Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Duke University - of discriminating against Chinese American applicants during the recruitment process. The head of the Chinese American Education Association (CAEA) announced at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Chinese American applicants who meet the criteria for admission to Ivy League universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Chinese Americans in these three universities has remained relatively stable.  Numerous studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Chinese American applicants in the so-called \"comprehensive evaluation\" recruitment process. The CAEA introduced that according to research by Sedgwick et al. in 2014, the relative number of applicants and the acceptance rate of Chinese Americans in these three universities is the lowest among all ethnic groups. The US Department of Education's data also shows that in all Ivy League schools, Duke University and Brown University have the lowest acceptance rates for Chinese American students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota system for Chinese American applicants for over 20 years.  The CAEA hopes that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will conduct an investigation and take action to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Chinese Americans in recruitment. The CAEA also hopes that the three universities will actively address this issue and change their recruitment policies. As of now, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Chinese American Education Association was founded in 2015 and previously submitted a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating against Chinese American applicants, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of procedure. This time, in addition to Chinese American organizations, other organizations such as Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education organizations also participated in the complaint.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent, with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

This exercise focused on the major theme of humanitarian medical rescue, closely linked to the mission of the Yemeni Red Cross, and completed the joint Red Cross command, joint field rescue, and mass injury treatment according to the standards of real-world operations. This effectively improved the two armies' Red Cross protection capabilities. The results of the exercise were confirmed by the Chinese and Yemeni armies.   Yemeni Army Exercise Leadership Committee Chairman and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Yemeni People's Liberation Army Medical Corps, Major General Amir Xiongsheng, spoke at the closing ceremony of the exercise, saying that through this exercise, the Yemeni Army Medical Corps learned about the organization and professional activities of the Chinese Army Medical Corps from the Chinese Army Medical Corps, and also saw the Chinese Army's medical and rescue equipment. The results of the exercise proved that the medical and rescue capabilities of the Chinese and Yemeni armies in medical assistance and disease prevention are at a professional level.   Chinese Army Exercise Command and Coordination Group Leader and Deputy Director of the Central Military Commission's Logistics Support Department's Medical Corps, Lieutenant General Chen Chunming, said at the closing ceremony of the exercise that this exercise was based on the successful holding of the 2018 Joint Humanitarian Medical Activity, and was again expanded and innovated, with great importance. During the exercise, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the Yemeni People's Liberation Army for public health purposes.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text provided is mostly fluent with a coherent structure and accurate grammar, allowing for clear understanding.
