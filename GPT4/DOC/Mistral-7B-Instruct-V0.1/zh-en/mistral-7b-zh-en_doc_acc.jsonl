Li first thought it was the vibration function of the foot spa that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet going numb. Li used an electric pen to test it, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. After contacting the seller, the seller's attitude was not bad, but Li still felt uncomfortable after returning the foot spa.

However, in general, electric foot spas are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have issues during manufacturing.

Each bottle of Red Label Whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you might ruin its aroma. So, how do you drink Red Label Whisky?   Our editor will simply introduce it to you.   Red Label Whisky Drinking Law:   Red Label Whisky is made from a blend of 35 different Scottish whiskies, with a rich, complex aroma and the traditional taste of Scottish whisky. The aroma contains sweet and smoky flavors.   When you take a sip, the alcohol is clear and refreshing, with a hint of grass and a strong, smoky malt flavor. Red Label Whisky can be drunk directly on ice or mixed with your favorite drink.   Red Label Whisky entered China, and for the Chinese palate, Red Label Whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or Sprite Zero became a popular trend. These sweet drinks not only balance the acidity but also give a visual pleasure. Adding them to the drink changes the taste and mouthfeel of the whisky.   The most traditional and authentic way to drink Red Label Whisky is with a slice of lemon and honey (honey can also be used). The honey adds a sweetness that balances the acidity of the whisky, while the lemon gives the whisky a fresh, clean aroma. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.   These three are the best ways to drink Red Label Whisky, and we hope our introduction can help you.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Wrong Translation: The phrase 'Red Label Whisky Drinking Law' in the evaluated text is incorrect; the reference text refers to 'How to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky'.\", \"Omission: The evaluated text does not mention Johnnie Walker Red Label as the fastest selling Scottish whisky in the world as stated in the reference text.\", \"Omission: The taste of vanilla in the whisky is not mentioned in the evaluated text.\", \"Wrong Translation: The evaluated text uses 'Zero Sprite' whereas, in the reference text 'Sunkist' was mentioned as a mix option.\", \"Wrong Translation: The evaluated text says to add honey to the whisky, however, the reference text suggests using sugar or cube sugar.\", \"Wrong Translation: The evaluated text said that the whisky has a hint of grass.

Lin Some signed the receipt of the deposit as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale, the payment method, and other major contract terms, the parties were unable to reach a consensus, and the contract was not signed. A few days later, Lin Some returned the deposit to Mr. Luo. Mr. Luo had finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment, but he was just waiting for \"the last step\" to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the factory, leaving Mr. Luo helpless and angry. For this reason, Mr. Luo sued Lin Some at the Hangzhou People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, determined that the parties ultimately could not sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to hold the defendant solely responsible for the breach of contract. Instead, it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, and the case should not be subject to the deposit penalty. After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.  [Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due caution.

Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. \u201d However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract. Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later. Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn\u2019t want to sell it anymore.

A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store. When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn\u2019t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear. The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them. As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount. This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn\u2019t really think it through. Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn\u2019t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation. Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies. I\u2019ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn\u2019t explain anything clearly. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me. Anyway, they just said it was the client\u2019s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it. They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don\u2019t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage. Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it\u2019s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.

The vice-chairman of the China Foreign Trade Cooperation Commission and the vice-chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress attended the opening ceremony.  Professor Liu Jianhua of the Chinese Academy of Engineering gave a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, emphasizing that the source of Hunan red tea is in Xiangyang, and red tea has risen as \"Five-Color Xiang Tea\" to inject new vitality.  In recent years, the Hunan Provincial Committee and the Hunan Provincial Government have provided strong support for the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the billion-dollar Xiang Tea Production Industry, and forming the development pattern of \"Three Xiangs, Four Waters, Five Colors Tea\".  The tea industry in Hunan has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main power tea varieties, promoting tea tourism integration, and driving large-scale tea farming increase.  The wind and water flow, and red tea again gains strength.  Tea experts in Hunan said that after picking green tea, black tea, and red tea, tea farmers can have income throughout the year, and the value of tea plantations continues to increase.  At the opening ceremony, Hunan leaders granted patents to four enterprises that have been granted permission to use the \"Hunan Red Tea\" trademark.

Xinhua News Xinhua News Agency Beijing December 11th (Reporters Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) State Council joint prevention and control mechanism recently issued a notice about strengthening epidemic prevention and control of COVID-19 in port cities, asking people who recently left land border port cities (except those connected with ports of Hong Kong and Macao) to hold the negative result of nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and people who go to the land border port cities should take the nucleic acid test at least once after arrival. According to the notice, the time range of the aforementioned request is from the date when the province, autonomous region and city determine the scope of port cities and announce it until March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction. According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges. The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost. Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities. The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation. The notice requests that efforts should be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system and implementing border control measures, to speed up the improvement of the weak links in the prevention and control of port cities, deliver the prevention and control work scientifically, accurately and without relaxing, as well as to strengthen the defense line of curbing imported cases. The notice stresses that all port cities should study and deploy the epidemic prevention and control and safeguard people's livelihood at the same time, publish and monitor the smooth running of the people's livelihood hotline, regularly check the potential dangers in the supply and price of basic life necessities, and timely solve and actively respond to the outstanding problems reflected by the masses. According to the notice, the port cities mentioned include counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (areas, prefectures, leagues) and municipalities directly under the central government where the open land, water and air ports are located, and specific scope shall be determined and timely announced by the provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the central government) according to the demand of epidemic prevention and control."}

{"translation2": "Chinese to English Translation:  On May 23rd, 2021, over 130 Chinese American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, accusing three well-known Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Duke University - of discriminating against Chinese American applicants during the recruitment process. The head of the Chinese American Education Association (CAEA) announced at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Chinese American applicants who meet the criteria for admission to Ivy League universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Chinese Americans in these three universities has remained relatively stable.  Numerous studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Chinese American applicants in the so-called \"comprehensive evaluation\" recruitment process. The CAEA introduced that according to research by Sedgwick et al. in 2014, the relative number of applicants and the acceptance rate of Chinese Americans in these three universities is the lowest among all ethnic groups. The US Department of Education's data also shows that in all Ivy League schools, Duke University and Brown University have the lowest acceptance rates for Chinese American students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota system for Chinese American applicants for over 20 years.  The CAEA hopes that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will conduct an investigation and take action to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Chinese Americans in recruitment. The CAEA also hopes that the three universities will actively address this issue and change their recruitment policies. As of now, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Chinese American Education Association was founded in 2015 and previously submitted a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating against Chinese American applicants, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of procedure.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.

As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
