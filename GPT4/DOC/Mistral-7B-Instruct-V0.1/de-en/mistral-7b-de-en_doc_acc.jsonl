{"translation2": "Translation:  Is it really that safe to choose tires when riding a bike? I woke up early this morning with a lot of excitement because I wanted to train for my upcoming bike tour in the next week. I got on my new bike that I bought on eBay yesterday and started riding. The first 40 kilometers were great, but then something happened that I had been expecting (this time in Krefeld). There were glass shards on the road. Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the way.

Maybe it's better if I practice changing tires before my bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me.

If I think about it, I'll need to change tires after 80-90 kilometers. I'm really not in the mood for that. Now I'm talking to an older man at the train station who asked me why I didn't use Marathon Plus tires; they're supposed to be puncture-proof. It all sounds very tempting. But are they really that puncture-proof? I don't have much enthusiasm left to spend 40 euros on tires and be disappointed. Moreover, I'm wondering if it's a problem that I'm using 25x622 on my bike. There are Marathon Plus tires available, but most of them are wider. Is this a problem? Or would you recommend a different tire for a bike? The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD.

Because of it being a work day, I didn\u2019t really have the chance to acquire a spare tire and tube, I had to turn back halfway through in a bad mood and take the next workable train back home.

At the same time, I ask myself: I am using 25x622 race tires at the moment, I believe. This is (apparently?) just like the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority of tires are actually wider.

But then, the SGE turned things around, scoring four goals in just over an hour to leave their frustrations behind and win fiercely.  \"It's insane what the boys did today,\" said trainer Oliver Glasner on DAZN, giving a \"praiseworthy performance to everyone who was there.\" At first, it looked like another setback for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, with Patrik Schick putting Leverkusen in a 2-0 lead. But what happened next left even the SGE trainer speechless.  \"How the players came back and put on a fantastic performance,\" said Glasner. \"I'm absolutely crazy happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result. Even Christopher Lenz, who had been out for four games due to a muscle injury, was back on the field and boosted the morale of his teammates.  \"I believe our mental strength is unbelievable,\" said the 27-year-old. \"I'm especially happy for the fans. That was the party we wanted to celebrate today.\"  Glasner now wants to focus on the upcoming tasks, but he is optimistic about the team's prospects. \"It's amazing that we have all our players fit in December, that they are all physically in top shape,\" said the trainer. \"It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live professionally.\"  Now, the team needs to \"take it step by step and remain humble\" while continuing to perform at this level until the end of the year.

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a vacuum tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is simply impressive. These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix vacuum tube preamplifier, which is partly based on real analog circuits because they better capture the tone variations and nuances of a vacuum tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system, which allows the natural resonances to sparkle only so much. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined. The perfect combination of vacuum tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Although it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, it was again responsible for a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and a variety of improved amplifier models. From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will find it here. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a vacuum tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string strikes, and a quick response. During an incoming analysis, VOX engineers discovered that above all the output stage determines the character of a vacuum tube amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.

{"translation2": "I am tired of Sky Sport F1  Hello F1 fans,  Over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has been declining, so I wanted to take a moment to express my frustration with this. Today, during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show. Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, it would have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision as well. It seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, leaving Sky DE with no choice. However, this is still frustrating, especially since Sky UK is broadcasting the race to the end.  There is one positive aspect: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job handling the difficult situation surrounding the accident. However, there were some mistakes by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher. They did not know that under a red flag, the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, it was only when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton that they realized that Verstappen could change his tires. At Sky UK and RTL, the commentators knew immediately that this was possible.  In my opinion, such basic rules should be known when commenting on F1 for a pay-TV channel. It is also not the first time that it has been necessary to guess what is allowed or required by the rules. Both commentators have constant uncertainties in this area, which makes them appear unprofessional. For example, when ordering coffee from the (clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or when Ralf Schumacher says \"UuuuuHD\". The latter brings a lot of confusion to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.  To make matters worse, the advertising takes over at Sky during the final lap. Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising during the race, as can be heard on F1TV. ServusTV and ORF do not do this. Additionally, both channels make less advertising during the training sessions than Sky, and this as a free-TV channel. Although we should thank Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of the program on Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repeats.  In conclusion, Sky is the worst German-speaking channel for F1 coverage. RTL, on the other hand, does a better job, especially considering the advertising. So far, the F1 season has been much less enjoyable than it could have been with a better channel. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Addition: The evaluated text provides additional explanation to the statement 'It seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, leaving Sky DE with no choice.' which is beyond what is included in the reference text.\",\n\"Others: Some phrases in the evaluated text were interpreted and then translated differently, which led to alteration in their details.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}

Again, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with reference to the Pokal-Niederlage against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: \"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\" However, this anger did not dissipate after the game - on the contrary, it increased even further in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) -loss in the Basketball-Bundesliga. In addition to the bare result, the manner of appearance was also disappointing. To illustrate this, a statistic can be cited, which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13%, with four hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? The answer came from John Patrick: \"We were not concentrated enough after the win in Teneriffa and did not manage to implement what we had trained.\" Namely, to move the ball. On the other hand, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: \"A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time,\" said the happy coach. \"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 spectators.\" However, only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, but they made up for it with their enthusiasm. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team. \"The best playmaker I've ever trained,\" praised Gleim. In contrast, the players in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed on the entire line. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a total debacle and come within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.

He first fought off the attacks of Johannes Lochner on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, jumping from third to the top. Then he changed something on the material settings and managed a great leap forward of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
