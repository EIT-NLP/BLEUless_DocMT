{"translation2": "Translation:  Is it really that safe to choose tires when riding a bike? I woke up early this morning with a lot of excitement because I wanted to train for my upcoming bike tour in the next week. I got on my new bike that I bought on eBay yesterday and started riding. The first 40 kilometers were great, but then something happened that I had been expecting (this time in Krefeld). There were glass shards on the road. Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the way. Since I couldn't get a replacement tire and inner tube on the weekend, I had to turn back and take the first bike path home. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. Maybe it's better if I practice changing tires before my bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me. Since I have a long route over several days ahead of me, I don't want to encounter this problem again. It wasn't that bad this time, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who picked up the bike at 14:00 and had ridden 120 kilometers on them) and the ones he considered suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years. If I think about it, I'll need to change tires after 80-90 kilometers. I'm really not in the mood for that. Now I'm talking to an older man at the train station who asked me why I didn't use Marathon Plus tires; they're supposed to be puncture-proof. It all sounds very tempting. But are they really that puncture-proof? I don't have much enthusiasm left to spend 40 euros on tires and be disappointed. Moreover, I'm wondering if it's a problem that I'm using 25x622 on my bike.

This results in slower internet speeds on the first floor, even though the new fiber optic connection is supposed to be much faster (\\~45 Mbit).

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a vacuum tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is simply impressive. These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix vacuum tube preamplifier, which is partly based on real analog circuits because they better capture the tone variations and nuances of a vacuum tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system, which allows the natural resonances to sparkle only so much. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined. The perfect combination of vacuum tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Although it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, it was again responsible for a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and a variety of improved amplifier models. From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will find it here. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a vacuum tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string strikes, and a quick response. During an incoming analysis, VOX engineers discovered that above all the output stage determines the character of a vacuum tube amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+-amplifier is equipped with a 12AX7 vacuum tube, which perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a vacuum tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent, with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax detected.

{"translation2": "I am tired of Sky Sport F1  Hello F1 fans,  Over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has been declining, so I wanted to take a moment to express my frustration with this. Today, during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show. Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, it would have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision as well. It seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, leaving Sky DE with no choice. However, this is still frustrating, especially since Sky UK is broadcasting the race to the end.  There is one positive aspect: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job handling the difficult situation surrounding the accident. However, there were some mistakes by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher. They did not know that under a red flag, the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, it was only when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton that they realized that Verstappen could change his tires. At Sky UK and RTL, the commentators knew immediately that this was possible.  In my opinion, such basic rules should be known when commenting on F1 for a pay-TV channel. It is also not the first time that it has been necessary to guess what is allowed or required by the rules. Both commentators have constant uncertainties in this area, which makes them appear unprofessional. For example, when ordering coffee from the (clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or when Ralf Schumacher says \"UuuuuHD\". The latter brings a lot of confusion to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.  To make matters worse, the advertising takes over at Sky during the final lap. Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising during the race, as can be heard on F1TV. ServusTV and ORF do not do this. Additionally, both channels make less advertising during the training sessions than Sky, and this as a free-TV channel. Although we should thank Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of the program on Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repeats.  In conclusion, Sky is the worst German-speaking channel for F1 coverage. RTL, on the other hand, does a better job, especially considering the advertising. So far, the F1 season has been much less enjoyable than it could have been with a better channel. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, unnatural wording, or stiff syntax.

{"translation2": "Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim  At least one player was missing for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg in their derby game against the Merlins Crailsheim. Again, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with reference to the Pokal-Niederlage against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: \"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\" However, this anger did not dissipate after the game - on the contrary, it increased even further in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) -loss in the Basketball-Bundesliga. In addition to the bare result, the manner of appearance was also disappointing. To illustrate this, a statistic can be cited, which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13%, with four hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? The answer came from John Patrick: \"We were not concentrated enough after the win in Teneriffa and did not manage to implement what we had trained.\" Namely, to move the ball. On the other hand, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: \"A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time,\" said the happy coach. \"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 spectators.\" However, only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, but they made up for it with their enthusiasm. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team. \"The best playmaker I've ever trained,\" praised Gleim. In contrast, the players in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed on the entire line. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a total debacle and come within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
