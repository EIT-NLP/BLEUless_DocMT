{"translation2": "Tire Choice for Racing Bikes - Really That Safe? I've been eagerly awaiting today, because I wanted to prepare for my upcoming cycling tour next week by at least a little bit of training. Said and done, and I went out on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were great too - but then what happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the route on no account. Since I couldn't really get a replacement tire and tube on Wednesday due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't quite as bad weather-wise, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the tour. Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would extremely unwillingly have this problem again and again. Now it wasn't really bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had driven 140km on the day I picked up the bike until 14:12!) and he also already described them as suboptimal because he had driven with them for years. But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tire after 80-90km, then I'm afraid I'm really in a bad mood :D Now I've had a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbreakable. That sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible? I don't want to spend 40\u20ac/tire now to find out that I'm disappointed. I continue to wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my bike, which is apparently also available (apparently?) with Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider. Is this a problem?

The first 40 km were really beautiful - but then that happened which is always waiting for you in the intercity (this time: thanks goes to Krefeld!). Glass shards on the road. Pop, a loud hiss and my back tire was no longer up for riding the rest of the trip. Because of it being a work day, I didn\u2019t really have the chance to acquire a spare tire and tube, I had to turn back halfway through in a bad mood and take the next workable train back home.

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which partly relies on real analog circuits because these are better at capturing the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers also offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined it. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to also meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the \u201cValve Reactor\u201d circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn\u2019t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn\u2019t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don\u2019t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I\u2019ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the \u201cAhhhh HD\u201d from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn\u2019t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn\u2019t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
