{"translation2": "Tire Choice for Racing Bikes - Really That Safe? I've been eagerly awaiting today, because I wanted to prepare for my upcoming cycling tour next week by at least a little bit of training. Said and done, and I went out on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were great too - but then what happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the route on no account. Since I couldn't really get a replacement tire and tube on Wednesday due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't quite as bad weather-wise, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the tour. Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would extremely unwillingly have this problem again and again. Now it wasn't really bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had driven 140km on the day I picked up the bike until 14:12!) and he also already described them as suboptimal because he had driven with them for years. But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tire after 80-90km, then I'm afraid I'm really in a bad mood :D Now I've had a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbreakable. That sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible? I don't want to spend 40\u20ac/tire now to find out that I'm disappointed. I continue to wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my bike, which is apparently also available (apparently?) with Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider. Is this a problem?

Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.

The further I move away from this module with the device, the less speed I get (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).

{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which partly relies on real analog circuits because these are better at capturing the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers also offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined it. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to also meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.

{"translation2": "Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Disaster of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim At least youngster Johannes Patrick was left out. Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: \"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\" But that anger didn't subside after the game - it even increased due to the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone was enough to disappoint, the way the Riesen performed was even more disappointing. A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13%, 4 shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? John Patrick's answer was: \"We weren't concentrated enough after our win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained.\" In other words, moving the ball. Sebastian Gleim, his opponent, had a completely different reaction: \"It was a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg,\" said the happy coach. \"It felt like we were playing in front of 10,000 people.\" There were only 750 spectators in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made the most of it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. \"The best playmaker I've ever trained,\" praised Gleim. Meanwhile, the performance leaders in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed on the entire court. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen avoid a total debacle and came within eight points of a comeback, after they had already trailed 39:59.
