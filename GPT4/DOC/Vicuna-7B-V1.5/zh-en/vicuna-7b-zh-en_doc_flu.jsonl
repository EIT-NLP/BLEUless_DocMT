Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Head Raised, Hua Liu Friend Price Hike, and the Goods Lala Incident. Public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then \"the index drops\" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion emerges, there will be a small peak again. They look exactly the same as the \"Network Opinion Evolution Model\" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in \"peak\", \"sawtooth\", and \"cliff\" shapes. \"Peak\" means human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; \"Sawtooth\" means periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings; \"Cliff\" means collective withdrawal, the hot search fulfilling its \"function\" and being assigned to a new task, moving towards a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave exactly matches the valley of another event, with time difference of only a few seconds, which must be the Cyberspace Administration of China receiving a task and launching a new round of attacks. The professionalism of black public relations can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones incite war, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones mislead judgment, which ones provoke emotions, which ones encircle and suppress decisions, and black accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes.

Today, the editors of Country\u7f8e\u5c0f\u7f16 will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath tanks are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tanks and other health-related household appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tanks, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath tank as a gift for his father's birthday, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them. At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath tank, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath tank was electric. Later, he contacted the store, and although the store was willing to refund the foot bath tank, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular foot bath tank, which has been around for a long time, lacks clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees. However, in general, foot bath tanks do not have electricity problems, but there is a small number of products that may not have been strictly inspected during production.

In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Liu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer. Ms. Lin signed the \"Factory Building Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt\" as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer, and both parties agreed to sign a factory building purchase and sale contract within a week. However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the sales range and payment method, the factory building purchase and sale contract was never signed. After several days, Ms. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Liu. It was difficult for Mr. Liu to find a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Liu filed a lawsuit against Ms. Lin in Yongjia City People's Court. The court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant.

Before the photo shoot, because we didn't arrange the time properly, we had to change the time twice. The consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a sunny weekend day for the photo shoot. The staff of Golden Flower Man were all amazing, whether they were consultants, makeup artists, or photographers. It was my first time having professional makeup done, and I was amazed. I couldn't believe that I would look that good one day. The makeup artist, Jiajia, and my other sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did an amazing job with the makeup, and it looked very natural. The photo shoot was held in Hangzhou City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so we didn't feel too cold. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothing and accessories from time to time, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel very happy during the photo shoot. When we were choosing the photos, we didn't want to take too many photos online because we saw a lot of examples, but when we were choosing the photos, we didn't add any extra ones (I heard that my cousin, who took her wedding photos, added over a thousand extra photos to her seven-thousand-yuan package, and I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many). The photos were edited today, and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they weren't that good, so they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who took our photos before with our photos, I was very satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted.

The reviewer initially went to the company based on a recommendation from a friend, with an initial budget of 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation. However, upon arriving at the company, they were subjected to a series of fraudulent tactics. The company gave the reviewer an unrealistically low quote of 70,000 yuan for a 135 square meter house and did not provide any information about the quality or brand of the materials they would use. They also pressured the reviewer to pay a deposit upfront, claiming that it would be difficult to get the money back once it was paid. The reviewer fell for this trap and paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The company's quote had many problems, as it did not include the cost of water and electricity upgrades, bathroom renovations, or the cost of doors and cabinets, which are essential for basic renovations. The company's service fees were also higher than those of other companies. The reviewer lost trust in the company and signed a contract without fully understanding the terms. When the reviewer tried to get their money back, the company acted like they were experienced and had a special team to deal with customers.

{"translation2": "The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control measures in border cities within 48 hours of obtaining a negative nucleic acid test result. Those traveling to border cities from outside the country must take a nucleic acid test within 48 hours of departure and undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government to March 15, 2022. In addition, border cities with conditions can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control. The National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office said that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides travel frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies will turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of controlling the spread of the epidemic by closing the border and reducing the risk of epidemic spillover, with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost. Recently, several domestic cluster outbreaks have occurred, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice pointed out that some places have problems with the timely monitoring and warning of epidemics, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions, the formalism of regular nucleic acid testing, the insufficient disinfection of cold-chain products, the unstandardized management of centralized isolation facilities, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic control.

{"translation2": "A coalition of 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against the admission discrimination faced by three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - in their recruitment process. The coalition held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint. The coalition's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three U.S. universities has increased tenfold in the past decade, but their proportion in these universities has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic consideration\" admission process, which is \"long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian-American applicants.\" Zhao Yuxuan introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among the members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, while Harvard University and Brown University had been practicing de facto racial quotas for Asian-American students for over 20 years. Zhao Yuxuan told reporters from China News Service that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department would investigate and take measures to stop these three universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American students in their admission process. They also hoped that the universities would proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-American students. Currently, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Asian-American Education Union was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, the coalition also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.
