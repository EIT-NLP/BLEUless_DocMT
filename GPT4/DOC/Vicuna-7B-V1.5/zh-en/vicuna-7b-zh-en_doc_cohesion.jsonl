Today, the editors of Country\u7f8e\u5c0f\u7f16 will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath tanks are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tanks and other health-related household appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tanks, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath tank as a gift for his father's birthday, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them. At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath tank, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath tank was electric. Later, he contacted the store, and although the store was willing to refund the foot bath tank, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular foot bath tank, which has been around for a long time, lacks clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees. However, in general, foot bath tanks do not have electricity problems, but there is a small number of products that may not have been strictly inspected during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath tank. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks.

After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to buy the factory building. In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Liu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer. Ms. Lin signed the \"Factory Building Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt\" as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer, and both parties agreed to sign a factory building purchase and sale contract within a week. However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the sales range and payment method, the factory building purchase and sale contract was never signed. After several days, Ms. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Liu. It was difficult for Mr. Liu to find a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Liu filed a lawsuit against Ms. Lin in Yongjia City People's Court. The court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. The court ruled that the defendant did not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first instance ruling, the plaintiff filed an appeal. Recently, the second instance court maintained the original judgment. [Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary caution and attention obligations.

Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. \u201d However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract. Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later. Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn\u2019t want to sell it anymore. For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People\u2019s Court.

The reviewer initially went to the company based on a recommendation from a friend, with an initial budget of 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation. However, upon arriving at the company, they were subjected to a series of fraudulent tactics. The company gave the reviewer an unrealistically low quote of 70,000 yuan for a 135 square meter house and did not provide any information about the quality or brand of the materials they would use. They also pressured the reviewer to pay a deposit upfront, claiming that it would be difficult to get the money back once it was paid. The reviewer fell for this trap and paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The company's quote had many problems, as it did not include the cost of water and electricity upgrades, bathroom renovations, or the cost of doors and cabinets, which are essential for basic renovations. The company's service fees were also higher than those of other companies. The reviewer lost trust in the company and signed a contract without fully understanding the terms. When the reviewer tried to get their money back, the company acted like they were experienced and had a special team to deal with customers. They blamed the customer for all the problems and refused to take responsibility. The reviewer warns others not to choose this company, as their friend's renovation project with the same company also had poor quality, and they were later charged for various fees.

A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store. When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn\u2019t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear. The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them. As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount. This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn\u2019t really think it through. Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn\u2019t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation. Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies. I\u2019ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn\u2019t explain anything clearly. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me. Anyway, they just said it was the client\u2019s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it. They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don\u2019t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.

{"translation2": "The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control measures in border cities within 48 hours of obtaining a negative nucleic acid test result. Those traveling to border cities from outside the country must take a nucleic acid test within 48 hours of departure and undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government to March 15, 2022. In addition, border cities with conditions can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control. The National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office said that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides travel frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies will turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of controlling the spread of the epidemic by closing the border and reducing the risk of epidemic spillover, with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost. Recently, several domestic cluster outbreaks have occurred, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice pointed out that some places have problems with the timely monitoring and warning of epidemics, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions, the formalism of regular nucleic acid testing, the insufficient disinfection of cold-chain products, the unstandardized management of centralized isolation facilities, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic control. The notice requires efforts to be made from nine aspects, including improving the mechanism for border city epidemic prevention and control, strengthening the monitoring and early warning system for epidemics, implementing border control measures, and publishing and promoting the hotline for ensuring people's livelihood security. Border cities are required to study epidemic prevention and control in parallel with ensuring people's livelihood security, publish and promote the hotline for ensuring people's livelihood security, regularly check the emergence of problems such as the supply and price of basic necessities, and proactively respond to prominent issues raised by the public. The scope of the border cities mentioned in the notice includes the counties (cities, districts, and banners) where land, water, and air border ports are located, as well as the prefecture-level cities, municipalities, and autonomous regions where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities.

In addition, the notice also requests that port cities with the capability can study the possibility of setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction. According to the introduction of the person in charge of the Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control of the National Health Commission, for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main local economic pillar and the border residents from both sides have frequent exchanges. The implementation of the policy of zoning and differentiated management is to make one defense line of the spread of prevention and control into two lines, make it possible to move the gateway forward, reduce the risk of the spread of the epidemic, and to achieve the maximum effectiveness of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and social cost. Recently, there have been many local cluster outbreaks of diagnosed cases in China, all of which were imported from overseas through port cities. The notice points out that this has exposed some problems, such as the untimely monitoring and warning of epidemic in some places, the non-existing implementation of closed-loop management of personnel in high-risk positions, regular nucleic acid testing becoming a mere formality, the inadequate disinfection and sterilization of cold-chain items in all links, the non-standard management of centralized quarantine sites, and the unscientific and inaccurate emergency response of epidemic situation.

The coalition's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three U.S. universities has increased tenfold in the past decade, but their proportion in these universities has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic consideration\" admission process, which is \"long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian-American applicants.\" Zhao Yuxuan introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups.

They also hoped that the universities would proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-American students. Currently, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Asian-American Education Union was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons.
