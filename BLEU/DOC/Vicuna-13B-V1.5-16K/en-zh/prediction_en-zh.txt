Android hardware Cleaning tip Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers. They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles. I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions. After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair. After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood. After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device. And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions. There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction. Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work... They work very VERY well! After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new. *I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy. De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer. Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor. He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994. De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990. Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election. President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor. "He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees. I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him. A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers. Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions. Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer. De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority. Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police. The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security. Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid. In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing. De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

ASSISTANT: 南非纪念最后一位种族隔离主义领袖德克莱克

南非周日向FW德克莱克，白人统治的最后一位总统，致以正式的致哀。德克莱克于11月11日因患病去世，享年85岁。为了纪念他，宣布了四天的全国哀悼。他于1989年至1994年担任总统，被记住最为引领南非从白人少数统治向多种族选举的过渡。德克莱克还与曼德拉共同获得1993年诺贝尔和平奖，曼德拉在1990年被释放后成为南非第一位黑人总统，赢得了1994年选举。南非总统西里尔·拉马福萨在星期日上午出席开普敦的荷兰改革教会（Protestant Groote Kerk）为德克莱克举行葬礼。“他往往因过于谨慎而被误解，”德克莱克的妻子Elita Georgiadis告诉大约200名听众。我将永远不会忘记这个迷住我的人，他让我想要帮助他完成他面临的这项巨大任务。私人仪式和国歌在仪式前先进行，仪式上展示了德克莱克的肖像，两盏蜡烛旁边，由装饰有白色花朵的合唱团伴随。尽管在国际上有积极的声誉，但德克莱克在南非引起了分歧的观点，他的去世引起了混合的反应。批评者说，他与种族隔离时代的罪行无法分离，如果他活得更长一点，他可能会受到追究。德克莱克代表南非国家党（National Party），该党在1948年正式建立了种族隔离和南非非白多数人的剥夺选举权。在教堂外，一小组抗议者持有“正义被否定”和“种族隔离时代的受害者正义”的标语，警察迅速带走了他们。周围地区被封锁，安排了高强度的安保措施。在他最后的几年中，德克莱克的形象也受到了批评，因为他没有正式道歉种族隔离时代的罪行。

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss. The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier. The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow. All were wearing avalanche beacons. While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion. "Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest. They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour). The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall. The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters). "We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm. People got excited," DeBerry said. "We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk." Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

ASSISTANT: 一座华盛顿州的滑雪度假胜地发生了一次雪崩，导致一人死亡，五人被困。该事件发生在周六，一次雪崩沿着一座滑雪度假胜地的边缘推进，导致一名60岁男子死亡，五名其他人被暂时困住。该事件发生在位于西雅图东南方约85英里（137公里）的克里斯塔尔山度假胜地的银色谷地区域，这是克里斯塔尔山度假胜地的一部分，该度假胜地提供访问后海滩滑雪的方式。克里斯塔尔山度假胜地是华盛顿州最大的滑雪度假胜地，总面积为2,600英亩（1,052公顷）。

克里斯塔尔山度假胜地的私人滑雪度假胜地决定了滑雪条件，但没有任何事情能够阻止滑雪者前往该地区，因为该财产毗邻麦考密克-斯诺克米尔国家森林的公共土地。克里斯塔尔山度假胜地的主席兼首席执行官Frank DeBerry表示，所有被困的人都持有该度假胜地的上山旅行证件，这意味着他们已经与滑雪救援部队登记，参加了有关如何通过度假胜地财产进行后海滩滑雪的培训，并必须在旅行前检查雪冰情况。“滑雪者可以在国家森林的任何地方自由旅行。他们走进了森林，但最终回到了度假胜地的范围内，这次雪崩就发生在那里。”DeBerry说。

除了关闭了雪崩发生的区域外，该度假胜地早上还关闭了雷诺山缆车，因为风速达到了每小时100英里（161公里）。这次雪崩发生在冬季第一次重要的大雪中。该地区受到冬季风暴警告的影响，直到周日早晨，美国气象局表示在海拔2,000英尺（610米）以上的地区可能会降下12到15英寸（38厘米）的雪。“我们开始的时候非常晚，现在我们从几乎没有

Hey r/Military! I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries. Hello everyone! I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force. Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29. You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60. In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year. However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission. If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such. I am just wondering how is it for other countries? If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country? What do you guys think about mandatory military service? During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada. Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military. I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well. Sorry for my poor grammar. English is my second language.

ASSISTANT: 嗨，r/Military！我来自一个强制实行军事役期的国家，我想知道其他国家的情况如何。大家好！我来自爱沙尼亚，我是国家防卫军的一员。在这里，男性从16岁到29岁必须完成8个月或11个月的训练，然后被分配到预备役部队，直到60岁。在这段时间内，防卫军有权要求您每年参加一两次军事演习，每次约为两周。然而，您不会被强制参加外国任务。如果您想这样做，您必须加入“探险兵大队”，成为一名专业军人，并享有薪酬等福利。我想知道其他国家的情况如何？如果您在美国或英国加入军队，那么您会被强制参加其他国家的战斗吗？大家对强制军事役期的看法是什么？在我在Tapa的训练期间（2018-2019年），还有来自英国、美国、法国、比利时、丹麦和加拿大的部队。不幸的是，我们没有太多时间社交，我没有机会向那些人面对面询问他们在自己国家的军队服役时的经历。我知道这个子论坛可能有很多北约成员，但听取其他（非北约）国家的意见也很有趣。对我的语法错误抱歉，英语是我的第二语言。

I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried. Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills. While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump, I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life. To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward. Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity. That's the thing. Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege. Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist. The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts. But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.

ASSISTANT: 我喜欢这样的文章能够帮助解决我父亲无休止地推崇的社会人格障碍男性的纷繁复杂网络，以及他谴责的领袖的多数。猜猜尼克松和卡特在哪里，而他的黄金儿子瑞根却无法做出任何错误。虽然我已经知道这种世界观是完全的胡扯，而且我憎恨从凯撒到波拿巴、尼克松、瑞根、布什和特朗普的每一个社会人格障碍男性，但我可以欣赏凯撒或拿破崙的历史意义，但他们的净化历史让我后来对他们失去了兴趣。到今天，我仍然拒绝学习波兰的历史，因为那只会让我父亲的妄想爆发出来。回到这篇文章，我喜欢这些细节，提醒你们，实际上有一个好选择（尽管存在一些小缺陷 - 但大部分是以良好的意图行事）和一个不好的一方，该一方不是以良好的意图行事，恶意更可能解释其行为，而不是愚蠢。这就是共和党人喜欢隐藏背后的愚蠢，而不是承认恶意。但请不要误解，如果一个政党的意识形态受到攻击，那么巧合、偶然等等很少存在。被围困的心态意味着每一个行动都必须计数，否则你将浪费有限的精力在毫无意义的行动上。但共和党人喜欢隐藏背后我们更为细腻的世界观，并试图反弹各种哲学剑。

Sunday Best: Enter 1880s New York in HBO's "The Gilded Age" Hat and parasol alert! "The Gilded Age," created by Julian Fellowes ("Downton Abbey") and written by Fellowes and Sonja Warfield, premieres next month on HBO. Set in 1880s New York, it follows Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson, above left) and aspiring writer Peggy Scott (Denée Benton, right) as they newly encounter old-money society. Also in the cast are Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector, among many more. Good fun for the winter, no?

Move the trailer! Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop. I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster. No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it. The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something. Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella. The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly). Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster? Me: No, the owner drove yesterday. Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster! Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it. Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there. You know we need to have access to the dumpster. Me: but I didn’t park it there. Why don’t you talk to the owner about it? Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah Me: It was not me. The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way. From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

ASSISTANT: 移动货车！几年前，我在一家橱柜厂工作过。我和老板一起去进行安装，回来时他将空货车停在垃圾桶旁边。没有特别的原因，只是那里有空间，所以他就停了。第二天早上我来上班，杰瑞（不是他的真名）来找我，表情很生气。没什么新的，他总是是个皮肤干燥的老人。以下是大致的对话（18年前，所以我不记得具体是什么）：

杰瑞：你昨天把货车停在垃圾桶旁边了吗？

我：不是，老板开车了。

杰瑞：你不能把货车停在那里，否则我就不能到达垃圾桶！

我：我没有把它停在那里，老板停了。但我可以把它移动。

杰瑞：我不知道为什么你会把货车停在那里。你知道我们需要到达垃圾桶。

我：但我没有把它停在那里。为什么不和老板谈论一下？

杰瑞：啊啊啊，你的错，这些年代的孩子没有礼貌，啊啊啊。

我：这不是我的错。以后，直到我几年后离开那家橱柜厂，每当我继续工作到晚上（这是比较常见的情况），并且5x8货车在工厂里，我都会把车顶把起来，把货车拖到垃圾桶旁边，让杰瑞在早上找到。

All our comics are sent bagged as standard. In addition, the older items are usually boarded as well. The newer items are bagged only. In addition to the above item, we have over 250,000 comics in stock, including both back issues and new items. All our comics are supplied from our real world store enabling us to offer a huge range of comics via auction. We've probably got what you're looking for! (If placing multiple orders, please request an invoice for the correct amount BEFORE paying.) This item is an original American comic and is in English! Please note that all our comics in every grade (EVEN POOR) will be complete unless stated otherwise in the listing! Please take the time to review both the attached cover scan and detailed grade description above to ensure that this particular comic is in the condition you require. Most of our listings offer Multi-Buy discounts. Usually starting at 3 or more items to gain the discount. The items can be ANY combination of ANY ITEMS included in the Multi-Buy. They DO NOT have to be multiple copies of the same item. Just pick the required total quantity and you'll automatically be given the discount on all of them! Some of our items include the option to place a best offer. If there is a Best Offer option, we'll consider any reasonable offer. We do not list ANY comics as Mint condition. In our view, this grade does not exist. Comic books are mass produced paper items, handled many times often with little care before even reaching the shop or newsstand to be offered for sale. EVERY COMIC, even a brand new one, will have some form of minor defect if you get out a magnifying glass and look closely enough. If you are intent on finding comic book perfection, or CGC guaranteed results, it would probably be best to view the comics in person at our store before bidding!

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist. Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said. Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene. A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest. A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes. We still don't know the reason he was killed. A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist. The whole community are shocked. May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents." Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager. Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him. This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances. There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible. We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us. I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why. It's the least Yahya's family deserve." Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10/12/21.

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me. When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause). Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”. I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car. A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental. None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle). None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim. They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage. Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department. I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction. If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

ASSISTANT: 一家位于加利福尼亚州的阿拉莫分店对我进行了类似的骗局。当我退还车辆时，代理发现车子底部有裂痕（我并没有造成）。我被迫签署承认“损坏”的文件。我也有视频和照片，但它们没有覆盖车子的底部。几周后，我回到家后，收到了一封信，列出了我还需要为其他损坏支付的费用——包括门的裂痕，这些损坏需要在我退还车辆几天后整理车辆的后部涂装。在我退还车辆时，这些损坏并不可见（或者在我退还车辆时并不可见）。在我退还车辆时拍摄的照片也没有捕捉到这些损坏。因此，我争辩了这个说法。他们拒绝了争辩，并要求立即支付损坏费用。由于这是一次工作旅行，所以我将我的照片交给了我们的法律部门。不久之后，我收到了来自阿拉莫的一封信，说他们决定放弃对客户满意度的考虑，免除这些损坏的费用。如果我没有是在工作旅行中，我肯定会因为损坏费用而付款，我相信这些损坏并不是在我负责的时间内发生的。

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions. This isn't even necessarily true. Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS. That's how most apps work now. > Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently. Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough? It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time? And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean? > This is in contrast to Google. Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share. I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps. That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

ASSISTANT: 解耦需要他们确保他们的应用程序在所有不同版本的 iOS 上都能正常工作。这并不一定是真的。只需要在应用程序支持的 iOS 版本上设置上限，并仅在具有最新兼容版本的设备上推送更新。这就是大多数应用程序现在遵循的方式。

此外，由于苹果公司可以频繁发布新版本的 iOS 和 macOS，问题在于这仍然不够频繁。这也导致了一些糟糕的用户体验。即使苹果将 OS 更新的频率提高，以考虑少数应用程序中的一些小错误，用户为什么每次都需要执行完整的 OS 升级？此外，“开发人员可以确保他们的补丁/功能将在新版本中推送”的意思是什么？

与谷歌相比，这是不同的。谷歌必须解耦，因为在手机上有很多 Android 版本，每个版本都占据了巨大的市场份额。我可以坚定地说，如果手机上的 Android 版本保持一致，就像 iOS 一样，谷歌从未会发布这些应用程序的版本。这是一个大胆的说法，但无论如何，它仍然不能解释将应用程序更新与操作系统更新一起打包是对开发人员或最终用户更好的方式。

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator. However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

Gabba的广播设施布局中存在的电力故障风险在下一次Ashes系列之前很可能无法改善，因为板球当局等待着更多关于2032年奥运会主场升级计划的详细信息。The Age和The Sydney Morning Herald的消息来源表示，Gabba是澳大利亚板球中唯一一个主要电力供应在场地内不足以启动全球广播所需的广播车和设备的大型体育场。在Gabba测试比赛的第四天，主要和备份发电机失效了约25分钟。这是因为基础电力需要供应Gabba的照明塔和场地本身。因此，广播公司从一个巨大的柴油发动机租赁的发电机中获取主要电力供应，备份电力应该来自备份发电机。然而，在测试比赛的第四天，主要发电机故障与备份发电机相结合，导致两者同时停机，导致近30分钟的全部或部分广播图像和DRS丢失。NEP公司，该公司为Fox和Seven提供外部广播车和其他设施，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。所有用于Ashes的其他场地（Adelaide Oval、MCG、SCG和 Hobart的Bellerive Oval）将提供电网作为广播公司的主要电力供应，留下柴油发电机作为备份。这种差异在过去引起了Fox Cricket作为主场广播商的很大担忧，而在Ashes测试中，由于减少的制作和技术人员数量，这种担忧得到了进一步加剧。Fox Cricket向Cricket Australia提供了几个月的警告，指出从技术角度上来说更安全的是在其他地方举办比赛，但如果它留在Queensland，将存在“巨大风险”。

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop. My neighbors got a dog about three years ago. These neighbors and I share a fence. It separates our back yards. Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard. I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc. but this dog is insane. The maintenance guys are afraid of it. So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill. I can't even use my yard at this point. That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop. I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence. Owner says no. I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar. Owner says no. (Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.) Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan. I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*. Like, I saved and invested in this. Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker. There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked. When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up. My speaker shakes the table. It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together. The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays. Edit some grammar errors Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL. This can seriously harm and even kill an animal. Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested. It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit. It sounds great for the money, though. I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

ASSISTANT: 一只不停吠叫的狗和我如何让它停止。我的邻居们三年前买了一只狗。这些邻居和我共享一个围栏。这个围栏将我们的后院分开。然而，这只狗咆哮、吠叫并试图从围栏中咬我。我试过忽略它、轻柔地说话等等，但这只狗疯狂。维护人员害怕它。所以我去做邻里的事情，向他们请求帮助我想出方法来让这只狗放松一下。我现在甚至无法使用我的后院。这只狗从早到晚都在外面，咆哮着，不停地吠叫。我请求可以通过围栏向它发放健康的零食。主人说不。我请求我们可以半额购买一个不使用电击的咆哮狗领带。主人说不。（修改说明我至少请求邻居三次帮助她的狗。）我感到沮丧，但我还没有愿意叫动物控制部门或者做其他任何事情，我策划了一个计划。我买了一个非常好的便携式扬声器，它很响。我为此节省并投资了。这个扬声器每次我去后院，我都会携带它。这里没有白天噪音限制，我检查过。当这只狗开始咆哮、吠叫并攻击围栏时，我的邻居们（其中的每一个人）都可以享受一些Lamb of God、Rotting Christ或其他很棒的音乐，音乐被放大了。我的扬声器抖动着桌子。邻居们很快就明白了。这只狗现在大部分时间都在家里，当它出现时，它很快就走了，或者主人陪着它出来。这个社区现在非常安静。（修改一些语法错误）（再次修改说明：请勿给狗任何类型的人类药物，如轻松剂或尼古丁。这可能会严重伤害甚至杀死动物。此外，扬声器是JYX品牌的便携式音响系统，如果有人感兴趣。它价格低于200美元，但我很穷，所以我需要一段时间才能

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list. You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag. A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality. A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance. Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available. Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow. Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one. Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole. The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number. The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood. To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip. Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners. External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying. Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used. Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area. Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering) Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use. Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort. This sleeping bag can be made extra long. Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation. Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe. We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of-the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life. Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop. Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry

ASSISTANT: 当谈到购买质量装备时，睡袋必须是首选。您可以在各种装备上节省，但不能在睡袋上。在野外露营或征途中，您将花费很多时间在睡袋里，而Snugpak让您放心质量。这是一款经过试验的热门产品，这款由英国制造的睡袋将微型封装大小与严谨的性能相结合。许多人将Softie 12 Osprey视为最佳四季合成填充睡袋。自1987年以来，它一直在为其他人制定冬季封装大小的标准。那些了解Softie 12 Osprey的人中，有的使用过它，有的则渴望拥有它。从苏格兰山脉的巅峰到雪洞的底部，Softie 12 Osprey与我们其他睡袋一样，在Softie Original Series中赋予了NATO存货编号。袋子的顶部是定制的，折叠的，并配有拉环，就像一件外套领口一样。为了防止2个方向的开锁从闩口或袋子边缘卡住，在闩口后面缝制有一条“防卡住带”。内部的垫子固定和挂钩标签内部的垫子固定标签与我们提供的垫子固定标签相对应。外部的固定标签使您可以轻松挂起袋子进行通风和晾干。减小袋子到圆形脚部，形成“毒蜘蛛”形状，易于暖和，减少了使用材料的重量。很难在图片中看到，但全长的开锁层在袋子后面，在闩口后面，以防止通过闩口区域泄漏热量。购买左右两个，可以制作成双人床（请在订购时检查）。包括压缩袋，使睡袋在不使用时变小。可以与Snugpak Exanda面板结合使用，制作出更舒适的宽床。这款睡袋可以制作成更长的版本。单层Softie隔板睡袋。Snugpak位于1800年代建造的一家历史悠久的纺织厂

I was buying new tires. I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website. I printed out the page and took it to my local shop. It was part of a chain. The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout. Don’t know where he got the higher price from. Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout. He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price. He was gracious about it too. Been buying tires from them ever since.

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words. It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream. Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating. If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir. Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive. I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate). Shipping alone was approx. US$100. I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world. Finally, love your boards! Much respect.

This is the thing people don't get. The math doesn't say you can't get really sick if you're young and healthy. Maybe I'm a pessimist, but that's better than thinking you're invincible. That shit will get you killed. I think I took it seriously because I've been sick a lot, and I hate it. I'm healthy in general, but the flu always hits me very hard. I was scared that Covid was going to be worse. It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough. Still took months for my body to return to normal. I don't know why it affects people differently, but for me it was body pain and headaches that were the worst part.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border. He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office. It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday. Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow. Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues. The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there. Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government. The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages. Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner. The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation. Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday. She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage. She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border. Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries. On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels. Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure. His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays. On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13. These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets. I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it. How come we never saw the main shuttlebay? It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility. Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13. In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life. Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life. Couldn't they have done this on TNG? We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle. We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space. The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."

ASSISTANT: 众所周知，**星际迷航：下一代**的**星际舰队D**拥有**三个**船舱。在节目中，我们总是看到船舱2和3，分别位于12和13层。这两个船舱由一个可以容纳全大小飞船模型的全尺寸工作室模型构成。我一直喜欢当剧集展示船舱后部的双船舱时。为什么我们从来没有看到主船舱呢？它位于船舱3和4层的下方，应该是一个庞大的设施。相反，桥塔船员会乘坐电梯直接经过它，一路降至13层。在原始的**星际迷航**中，建造了一个小型的船舱模型，并使用了一个小型的飞船来赋生船舱。有时候，角色会在打开到船舱的门口时进行对话。使用小型船舱和飞船的超叠技术，可以让船舱和飞船看起来很真实。在**下一代**中，为什么不能做到这一点呢？我们在“最佳两个世界，第二部”中看到了沃夫和数据从主船舱发射飞船，但是飞船发射的场景是从飞船内部看到的。我们只能看到船舱外墙，飞船飞出船舱，很快被太空所替代。除了“因果关系”之外，我们只有两次看到主船舱的全规模，一次是看到船舱门打开，压缩了主船舱，我们快速看到了里面，以及一些停放的飞船。有什么想法可以解释为什么主船舱在这两个情况之外从未被看到呢？

I see it all the time in my line of work. And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating. Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life. Peer to peer failed. Insurance says it’s not medically necessary. We appeal. They say no again. We go to third party appeal. We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure. We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure. 24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No. Not medically necessary.” My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE! But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”. Of course, they don’t. And this kid is screwed. No other option. As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive. We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal. Not this time. The system is so broken.

ASSISTANT: 我一直在我的工作中看到这一情况。而且甚至不必是生死关头就会令人沮丧。最近有一位患者需要一种特定的膝关节手术才能正常行走并提高生活质量。同行间的协商失败了。保险公司说这不是医学必要的。我们申诉。他们又说不。我们去第三方申诉。我们提交了所有支持手术必要性的相关医学研究。我们甚至包括了一位不在我们计划内的不同外科医生的第二次意见——当然，他也建议进行手术。 24小时后，他们回复说最终“不，这不是医学必要的”。我的外科医生气得炸了，他说“好吧！但你得告诉我哪种手术你会推荐，因为我不知道哪一种手术可以帮助这个孩子”。当然，他们没有回答。这个孩子就陷入了困境。没有其他选择。最终发现，这种手术通常被保险公司厌恶，因为它比较昂贵。我们通常需要为其申诉，但他们通常会在申诉后同意。这一次不是。这个系统太破损了。

How was the farewell to Etho was like? First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife. I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P) Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right. Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone. I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak. With that out of the way >.<... So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day. Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc. While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history. Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial. How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts. Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such. Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things. Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms. This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me. What I am after is the other side of the picture? As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff. So how was the response from 'the old gang'? Did you keep doing stuff together? Did you slowly drift apart? Still chat or invite one another to events? Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats. Kinda the opposite. I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt. P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected. That's awesome as heck!

ASSISTANT: 以下是英文文档的中文翻译：

Etho的告别怎么样？首先，一个快速的抱歉：我不是账户用户，而是她的妻子。由于我对技术不擅长，所以我使用了这个账户。我有权使用这个账户，因为这对我的心理健康有帮助（我确实看到了一个技术不擅长的人问关于红石巨人的问题的矛盾：P）第二个，远远比第一个更重要的抱歉：我不想引起争议，也不想怀疑某些事情没有正确地发生。据我所知，这只是一个风向的变化，不适合每个人。我只是一个老粉丝，满足了一个怀旧情绪。现在，我曾经是Mindcrack的巨大粉丝，从未错过GuudeBoulderfist的发布，喜欢合作等等。在观看一个随机的YouTube视频时，我发现一个视频详细介绍了Etho的频道历史。在视频的最后，它触及了Mindcrack走向商业化。他对这一事件的看法并不积极，拒绝签署相关合同的不可避免。再次，成为职业选手或保持休闲状态都不是错误的决定，我知道人们会走在不同的方向上。快速的谷歌搜索带我到了这个老的线程，显示了他的一份声明。从表面上看，你看到了事情的不同方面，但总体上保持了良好的关系。这整个故事发生在我自己已经转移到其他事情了，所以对我来说都是新鲜的。我想知道另一面的故事是怎样的？正如我所说，我的心理健康状况并不理想，看到曾经喜欢的老团队在粉丝中分道扬镳，可能会对我的心理状况有一些积极的影响。因此，我想知道老团队的反应是怎样的？你们是否继续一起做事？是否逐渐分开？仍然会聊天或邀请彼此参加活动？再次说，我并不期待任何戏剧性的事情，或者看到人们在彼此的喉咙上。相反，我想看到某种程度上的低调关闭，这对我的心理状况有一些积极的影响。P.S.我无法帮

It was prior to 2018. I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening. The counter people were the worst I have ever seen. A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here. I had a confirmed reservation went. After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off. I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away. I swore to never use Avis again. Worst car experience ever. National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me. Those two, followed by Enterprise. Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter. I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague. It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.

ASSISTANT: 在2018年之前，我在费城的美国航空公司处于停顿状态，而不是带我直接前往新泽西。我和几十个人一起试图在晚上获得汽车。大堂人员是我见过的最糟糕的。一条排队，他们在休息和谈论与工作无关的随意话题，就好像我们根本不在这里一样。我有一个确认预订，但她大声指责我撒谎，让我生气了。经过一个小时的等待，我告诉她我预订了什么，她又开始大声指责我撒谎，让我终于放弃了，走到Hertz，他们收费很贵，但立刻给了我一辆车。我誓言再也不会使用Avis了。这是我遇到的最糟糕的车辆体验。National和Hertz一直是我的好体验，然后是Enterprise。Enterprise并没有做出任何糟糕的表现，但它们从来没有像National那样方便，我可以直接走过去，挑选一辆车，然后开车驶走，而不必等待永远的大堂。我知道这些是个人经验，但我会努力向每个人推荐避免Avis，就像避免疾病一样。良好的客户服务会使客户忠诚，而糟糕的客户体验会赶走十倍的客户机会。

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights. The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months. France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year. The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough. Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests. "Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement. The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue. The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26." On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link. Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought. I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither. After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help. Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want? >This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi. This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die. No, it's not. This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller. If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit. Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated. >At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong. We've already done this. Twice. It hasn't stopped them. And it's not like this is harmless. There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots. Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match. How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded? How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know? And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time? I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

ASSISTANT: 这个观点在暴露在任何批判性思维的挑战下就会崩溃。我不排除认为有很大一部分人不实践批判性思维，但无论如何，证明它错误并不能保证它会消失。毕竟，我们已经进行了审计和手动计算这些选票，但这并没有帮助。我们应该继续让他们“审计”选票直到他们得到他们想要的结果吗？ >这就像让Uri Geller试图在James Randi面前展示他的诡计。这就是故事的结局，谎言将在这里死亡。不，这不是这样。这是Uri Geller试图在James Randi面前展示他的诡计，不喜欢结果，然后雇用一家CEO声称相信他的能力是真实的公司来“研究”他的能力并调查Randi是否是共产主义者，试图毁掉Geller。如果在这里没有产生任何结果，他们将要求进行另一次审计。或者他们将声称把破碎的投票纸放入鸡肠中，然后将鸡烤在烤箱里。 >在某个时候，你必须真正审视现实，并将其与他人的想法进行比较，指出他们的错误。我们已经做了这个了。两次。这没有停止他们。而且这不是无害的。已经有关于这些人可能违反联邦法未能正确保护投票单的指控。在那篇文章中还提到这家公司计划在马里科帕县的部分地区进行实地调查，询问人们他们的投票是否匹配。如果你告诉他们你投了票，你会感到舒适吗？如果你不告诉他们，你的选票可能会被标记并丢弃。你确定这家公司会保持这些数据的私密性，不让其他社区成员知道吗？如果你知道这是一种可能性，你会否愿意投票？我认识很多人都不会。

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries. Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations. "Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting. It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress. Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months. The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks. A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks. "The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks. Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance. Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies. Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported. The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord. The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club. Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday. It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground. Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday. The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool. Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat. Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results. Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed. Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

This is a different issue. Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop. It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone. Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be. We treat the disabled like crap. We treat the poor like crap. Everyone in the US should be ashamed. You're correct that our society needs to value human life more. If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down. We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths. Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on. Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS. I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people. It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world. "The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. "People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it." He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it. The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years. It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government. Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more. Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability. "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors. Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days. Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing. The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software. Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software. Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous. New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released. The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said. It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

ASSISTANT: 各组织高度警惕，技术公司纷纷努力修复软件漏洞。一个广泛使用的软件工具中发现了一个严重的漏洞，这个漏洞很快被在在线游戏Minecraft中快速利用，成为全球组织面临的重大威胁。“互联网现在正在大火，”Crowdstrike网络安全公司智能副总裁Adam Meyers说，“人们正在匆忙修补，而各种人都在努力利用它。”他周五早上表示，自该漏洞存在被公开透露以来的12小时内，它已被“完全武器化”，这意味着恶意分子已经开发和分发了利用它的工具。这个漏洞可能是近年来发现的最严重的计算机漏洞。它被发现在云服务器和企业软件中广泛使用的一个实用程序中，这些软件在行业和政府中广泛使用。如果不修复，它可以让罪犯、间谍和编程新手等各种人都轻松地进入内部网络，从中盗取有价值的数据，植入恶意软件，删除关键信息等等。网络攻击现在被认为是金融稳定性最大的威胁。“我很难想到一家公司都不会受到威胁，”Cloudflare的安全总监Joe Sullivan说，“我们的在线基础设施保护网站免受恶意行为的影响。”无数服务器都安装了它，专家表示，影响将在几天内才得到了解。Tenable网络安全公司的CEOAmit Yoran称这是“过去十年来最严重、最关键的漏洞”-也可能是现代计算机历史上最严重的漏洞。该漏洞被称为“Log4Shell”，Apache软件基金会负责该软件的开发，将其评级为10分（1到10分的评分尺度）。任何人都可以利用漏洞获得未修补的计算机的完全访问权限，使用该软件。专家表示，漏洞使攻击者能够非常轻松地访问Web服务器（不需要密码），这是导致它如此危险的原因。新西兰计算机应急响应团队是第一个报告该漏洞正在“野外被积极

Yep…we guys all have guns. Even babies. We all walk around with them like it’s the Wild West. I don’t even know where to begin here. You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo? A crack head is not a “professional mugger.” If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what? Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings. Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it’s not happening. WTF does this have to do with race?

There's a circularity to it... I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition. The math they do is just crazy. "We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness. I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth. Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper. The problem is that we sold out the people below us. I agree with you. Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better. Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus. So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers. But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view. My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic. Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance. On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not. What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child? I dread to think. I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing. For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right. It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020. AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven. Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants. The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization. POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests. Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology. The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants. The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily. As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19. This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed. Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials. The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

ASSISTANT: 报道称韩国研究人员开发了一种分子诊断技术，可以检测奥米克隆变种。该技术的研发已经完成，预计将需要时间进行商业化。 POSTECH 10 日宣布，由李正旭教授带领的化学工程系的研究团队开发了一种分子诊断技术，可以在 20-30 分钟内检测到奥米克隆变种，并将结果发布在线。奥米克隆变种是新冠病毒使用刺突蛋白感染细胞的变种，其中刺突蛋白有 26-32 个突变。据研究团队介绍，分子诊断技术可以在单碱基底物层面上区分突变，因此可以检测到难以通过 PCR 测试检测的“隐形奥米克隆”。目前，韩国疾病控制与预防中心使用三种方法检测 COVID-19 变种：整个基因分析、目标 DNA（例如刺突蛋白等突变）分析和 PCR 测试。在 delta 变种的情况下，可以通过当前的 PCR 测试检测到，但对于奥米克隆变种却不行。本次开发的新技术不是一种阅读 DNA 或 RNA 序列的测序方法，而是一种分子诊断技术。现有技术仅在病毒的特定区域上进行筛选，而分子诊断技术被设计为仅在新冠病毒 RNA 存在时引起核酸结合反应，从而实现快速检测。据李正旭教授介绍，奥米克隆变种在 PCR 测试中对 N 基因具有强信号，但对 S 基因的信号较弱。在“隐形奥米克隆”的情况下，N 和 S 基因均为积极，从而使其难以与其他变种区分。与传统技术不同，分子诊断技术可以有效地检测奥米克隆变种。与传统技术通常处理每个设备 96 个样本的情况相比，新技术可以在 30 分钟内处理超过 125 个样本（超过 250 个样本每小时）。此外，该技术不需要专门的设备，因此可以简单地制作诊断试剂盒。由于该方法可以在 4 天内开发诊断试剂盒，因此在未来出现新变种或病毒时也可以迅速作出诊断。“我希望公开

I told ya so.... The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization. Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was. Needless to say, it was chaos. At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was. I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks? straws?). Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7." Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off. Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there. A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not. He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8. I'll help you find them, ma'am." As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know". Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line. As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her." HA....told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue. My water heater is set pretty low. It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment). Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold. If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath? Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied? Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice! I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick. The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation. It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.

Iran reports lowest number of daily COVID-19 cases in more than one year Iran's Health Ministry has registered 1,686 new daily COVID-19 infections, the lowest tally over the past 460 days, marking a sharp decline in cases as the fifth wave of the pandemic subsides. According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital. It added that 6,152,524 people in the country have contracted COVID-19 and 5,963,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals. According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units (ICU) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran. Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign. So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots. The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses. Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead. According to the latest figures, eight cities are in the orange zones, 119 in the yellow category, and 321 cities are in blue zones. There is no city in the high-risk red zone. Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said on Wednesday that the country is fully prepared to roll out coronavirus booster vaccinations. "Today there is neither concern nor any shortage in the supply of vaccine and the ground is ready for the third and fourth dose vaccinations," Mokhber added.

The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth. I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules. The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course. If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online. Here is the course intro **CompTIA A+ Course Intro**

The lining may be a lighter or darker colour to the one shown in the images. Please write to us to know the current stock color. Genuine leather might have very small cut / scars / mark on it. This does not mean it is damaged. There may also be visible creases in the leather.

You know something. I get what Dave's point was. It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people. And of course that's true. But Dave forgot something. Many people who hate trans people also hate black people. He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter. He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric. He's given credibility to transphobia. And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence. He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him. How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.

ASSISTANT: 你知道，我明白达夫的观点。杀死黑人比取笑Trans人更糟糕。当然这是事实。但达夫忘记了一件事情。许多讨厌Trans人的人也讨厌黑人。他没有赢得任何人对#blacklivesmatter的欣赏。他只是赋予了Trans恐惧症的另一位英雄和更多反Trans言论。他赋予了Trans恐惧症的可信度。考虑到最脆弱的Trans人是黑色Trans女性，他让她们成为了暴力的目标。他离开了他的节目，因为他意识到白人正在笑着他，而不是和他一起笑。他怎么没有意识到他对Trans人做了完全相同的事情非常令人遗憾。

A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee. So to note, I didn’t witness this. I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job. These two guys came to the store. One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law. After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it. This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door. Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid. When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him. I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle. I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on. But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set. He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

ASSISTANT: 一名盗贼的裤子在逃跑时掉下来。需要注意的是，我并没有目睹这一幕。这是我在第一份零售工作中的同事告诉我的。这两个人来到了商店。其中一个人在城镇里非常闻名，总是与法律发生纠纷。经过一段时间的浏览后，这个闻名的人离开并回到了他的车辆，而另一个人拿着一个购物车，把一套500美元的扳手套件放进去。这个伙伴然后等到两个收银员在出口门口忙碌时，离开商店。两个人注意到这一点，并问彼此是否收到了款项。确认他没有支付后，其中一个人追赶了他。我被告知收银员喊叫着要他停下来，但他开始奔跑，拖着一辆装有扳手套件的购物车。我不知道他是否喜欢佩戴低裤，或者他没有戴上腰带。但我被告知，他的裤子开始掉下来，他在奔跑和拖着一辆装有扳手套件的购物车时挣扎着拉着裤子。他最终放弃了购物车，留下了扳手套件，把裤子拉了起来，奔向逃跑的车辆，跳进了逃跑车辆中，与他的闻名伙伴一起逃走。

I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past. If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs, we might be able to help! Depending on the company. I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by. I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately. I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course. Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!" We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed. Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services. These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons. It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps. Some gyms let you rent lockers. Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.

ASSISTANT: 我是一名人力资源专员，曾经负责过薪酬工作。如果有人来找我说他们正在努力脱离一种经济虐待关系，而他们的虐待者会查看他们的工资单，我们可能能够提供帮助！这取决于公司。我没有需要进行以下任何操作，但我曾经需要让员工离开我们的目录，教门卫员假装不知道他们是谁，以及如何识别虐待者如果他们来看望。我可以制定安排将钱以后税扣除，给扣除一个不符合名字，让它看起来像是某种强制性扣除，然后“支付”这笔扣除回给你。当然，我可能需要让你签署一份协议。另一个我可能能够做的事情是：与你进行一个假的电子邮件对话，谈论为什么你的工资单不见了或为什么你的密码不起作用（当你更改密码后）以及我们“正在努力解决这个问题，谢谢你的耐心！”我们没有这个，但一些雇主可以将全部或部分工资支付到他们自己的信用卡上，不需要银行。此外，许多雇主有各种未利用的员工支持服务。这些服务的范围可能从心理咨询、法律保险到折扣和优惠券。值得询问他们有什么，以便你可以利用任何有助于你的东西。一些健身房允许你租个锁器柜。这不是一个理想的地方藏物，因为盗窃是一个风险，但对于一些人来说，这可能是一个可行的选择。

Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that. Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK. They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march. Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year. "All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram. Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it. An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers. UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it. It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade. The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council. The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse." Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city. The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march. A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

ASSISTANT: 在英国布里斯托尔，游客纷纷排队购买神秘街头艺术家Banksy设计的支持拆除奴隶商人雕像抗议者的T恤。这款限量版“纪念品T恤”是为了支持上一年被指控损害争议性雕像的四名被告而设计的。Banksy在Instagram上写道：“所有收益将支付给被告，以便他们可以去喝一杯啤酒。”这款T恤以25英镑（约33美元）的价格（不含VAT）销售，限量一个人只能购买一件，因此在多家商店的推广下，这款灰色T恤的需求如此之大，人们甚至排队了几个街块才能购买到。在推特上发布的一段几乎两分钟的视频显示了无尽的顾客队伍。英国媒体报道称“数千”人渴望通过购买这件灰色T恤来筹集资金支持抗议者。这件T恤描绘了一个空的台座，上面写着“布里斯托尔”，它指的是17世纪商人爱德华·哥伦顿的雕像，他涉及了大西洋奴隶贸易。这些被称为“哥伦顿四人组”的活动家将在布里斯托尔皇室法院接受审判，被指控损害城市议会拥有的纪念碑。这四名被告均不认罪，被指控在没有合法理由的情况下沉沦了雕像。尽管在他死后捐赠了一些慈善款项，但争议性商人的雕像在2020年6月，当布里斯托尔举办支持黑人权利（BLM）运动的抗议活动时，遭到攻击。损坏的台座和被涂鸦的雕像后来被市议会从布里斯托尔港中拯救出来，并作为当地博物馆展览的一部分，与一组BLM抗议海报一起重新出现。之前占据哥伦顿雕像原位的空旷台座上，建立了一座BLM抗议者的雕塑。

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states. "We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming. Everything," he said. "And obviously it has some impact here." At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm. The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history." He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate. "All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said. The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change. "As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle. "How are we going to handle this?" he continued. "Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen." Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution. "So we have to act," he said. Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms. "I promise you. Whatever is needed. Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said. He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government. "I want folks in all these states to know. We're going to get through this. We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said. "This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans." The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts. "I do plan on going," he said.

ASSISTANT: 乔·拜登谴责全球变暖无法阻止猛烈的龙卷风 美国总统乔·拜登在周六谴责全球没有阻止全球变暖，并批评龙卷风在多个州造成了广泛的破坏和数百人的死亡。他说：“我们都知道，当气候变暖时，一切都变得更加激烈。一切。” “而且显然它对这里产生了一些影响。” 至少有30个龙卷风在六个不同的州报告，引起广泛的破坏，预计有100多人死于这场暴风雨。总统承认他不知道全球变暖对这场灾难性龙卷风的贡献有多大，他描述这是“历史上最大的龙卷风爆发之一”。他表示他将派遣环境保护署调查。 “我所知道的是，气候变暖对天气整体的激烈程度有一定影响，” 拜登说。 总统称赞了提出气候变化问题的记者。 “正如往常一样，你总是提出最好的问题，” 他说笑着。 “我们该怎么办？” 他继续说。 “其中一部分是承认，在没有继续应对全球变暖的情况下，预防气候灾害的可能性很小。” 拜登表示，他很震惊于2021年国内的记录烈火，表示全球变暖是主要贡献之一。 “所以我们必须行动，” 他说。 拜登表示，第一步是拯救生命并照顾受灾家庭。 “我保证你们。无论需要什么，联邦政府都会提供。” 他说。 他表示，他将仔细监测龙卷风恢复工作，并做好联邦政府必须做的一切。 “我希望所有这些州的人都知道，我们会度过这个困难时期。我们会一起度过这个困难时期，联邦政府不会放弃，” 他说。 “这是那些我们不是民主党人或共和党人的时候。” 总统表示，他计划前往受灾地区，但要确保他不会干扰当地的救援行动。 “我计划去，” 他说。

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018. "I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010. "Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series. Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography. Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died. Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

ASSISTANT: 《吸血鬼面谈》作者安妮·雷斯（Anne Rice）因中风并发症去世，年龄80岁。她的儿子克里斯托弗·雷斯（Christopher Rice）表示，她因中风并发症去世。雷斯最大的成功是她的第一部小说《吸血鬼面谈》，该书于1976年出版，引入了吸血鬼莱斯塔（Lestat）这个角色，他成为了《吸血鬼历史纪录》系列的中心人物，该系列共有13部，最近一部于2018年出版。“我对莱斯塔有一个想法，他是一个行动的男人，他可以做我做不到的事情”，雷斯在2010年在伊利诺伊南方伊利诺伊大学的演讲中说。《吸血鬼面谈》于1994年被改编成成功的电影，帮助重新激发了对吸血鬼题材的兴趣，这一趋势一直延续到了电视剧《暮光之城》和《暮光之城》电影系列。尽管她大部分时间居住在加州，但雷斯出生于新奥尔良，并在她的网站传记中表示，她的许多故事都设定在那里。雷斯的儿子克里斯托弗·雷斯表示，他在母亲的床旁陪伴着她去世。安妮·雷斯将在新奥尔良举行私人仪式安葬，并计划在明年举行公共紀念儀式。

Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage. Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage. I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone. I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case. After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data. After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do. I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable. Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue. Have you experienced this as well?

ASSISTANT: 苹果音乐文档和数据存储空间大小最近，我从iPhone 12 Pro更新到了13 Pro Max，在这两款iPhone上，我注意到了一个漏洞，正在吃掉我的内部存储空间。苹果音乐的文档和数据占用了约35GB的内部存储空间。我尝试通过删除应用程序来缓解这个问题，但由于这是一个内置应用程序，文档和数据从iPhone上永远不会真正删除。我认为，一旦我更新到新的iPhone 13 Pro，这个漏洞就会消失，但这并不是情况。在从iCloud备份中安装后，我检查了苹果音乐应用程序，它仍然在使用超过30GB的文档和数据。我联系了两名苹果支持专家，其中一个建议我清除iPhone并重新开始，而另一个没有提供任何有效建议，因为该问题超出他们能够处理的范围。我还检查了我的iPad，似乎AM只在其上使用15GB的文档和数据，但这仍然不可接受。现在，我转向社区，希望了解这个问题是否广泛存在，并且希望引起苹果的关注。您是否也遇到了这个问题？

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2? Specifically 2.10 "Over" Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting. Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this? Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?" A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time. I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations. I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday. Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs. Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time. I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son. He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person! He clearly sucks at damage control. Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

ASSISTANT: 为什么Skyler和Walt Jr.在第2季第10集"Over"中为什么对Walt在家里工作如此生气？具体来说，Walt替换了热水器，然后替换了看起来可能并不一定腐烂的板材。为什么Skyler似乎非常生气？完全灰心丧气，她问道：“你今天还要去上班吗？”在前一周或两周之前，她非常支持他休息和恢复。我理解她对婚姻不满，但Walt Jr.似乎对Walt在家里进行一些维修感到轻微生气并完全困惑。我也知道Skyler在希望有人对她优先照顾，而Walt自从他的50岁生日以来一直将一切都关注在自己身上。然而，我一直觉得很奇怪，在重新观看时，Sky和Jr.似乎非常生气Walt在家里做些有意义的事情，而不是躺在床上或杀人或制毒。他只是像一个普通的房主一样，利用空闲时间修缮房子。我也理解这只是另一种绝望的尝试，试图通过这种方式来维持他作为丈夫和家庭成员的角色，尽管前几天强迫他的16岁儿子喝茶干。他很明显在尝试通过夸大一个问题来展示他做了一个很棒的工作，是一个很棒的人！他很明显不擅长处理危机。尽管如此，他的妻子和儿子的反应仍然一直让我感觉不对劲，仿佛在这种情况下试图强调Walt的绝望尝试来弥补他的糟糕错误。

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups. It’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples. Ahmad Aubrey’s trial is also an example of positive impact. The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff. However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident. Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization. Transparency is the name of the game. Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country. When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder. Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.

ASSISTANT: 在某些社区中，教堂为一些受到迫害的社会群体提供了一个安全的地方。这不是巧合，民权运动与少数族裔教堂、清真寺和寺庙密不可分。阿姆德·亚伯瑞的审判也是一个积极影响的例子。恶魔教派也在做一些好的事情。然而，系统中存在问题的例子一直存在。宗教组织和机构应该与其他慈善组织一样受到相同的标准约束。透明度是关键。从天主教会的案例来看，可能需要确保这些免税宗教组织获得的资金不离开国家。当我想到宗教会员时，也许合作社模式是有用的；每个成员都有一个决策权，作为利益相关者。希望他们至少为社会保障贡献。

I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive. When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!" thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what. I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover. Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down? They'd all have been killed. BUT if they were like "Keep working!" instead of "Take Shelter!", that's different. Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?

ASSISTANT: 我认为（虽然我不确定）他们可能在告诉他们不安全开车。当龙卷风变得如此即将时，天气预报员通常会发出“立即寻找避难所！”的警告，因为你不知道它会在两分钟或十分钟或什么时间内发生。我不知道他们有权禁止人们离开的权利，但我可以想象他们会告诉他们寻找避难所。可以想象那些人在龙卷风触地时从停车场排出来的情况，他们全部都会死亡。但如果他们是“继续工作！”而不是“寻找避难所！”，那就不同了。有人知道他们是否仍在工作或者是否在某个地方寻找避难所吗？

Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned. I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300. But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not. If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all. It might just narrow your deficit that one day. An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though? That’s a no go. If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place. Maybe start with 300 deficit. Hope this helps!

ASSISTANT: 是的，这意味着当我锻炼时，我真的不在乎它消耗多少卡路里，也不会因此改变我的数字或蛋白质。我会尽量遵循1200-1300的范围。但如果我特别饿，我会吃更多的东西来给身体提供燃料，并接受损失一天的体重可能会更慢，或者不会。如果你已经做了500卡路里的削减，一个额外的牛排或面包之后也不会让你的进展受到太大的影响。这可能只是让你的缺口缩小了一天。额外的比萨或冰淇淋呢？不行。如果你经常因为锻炼而需要吃更多的东西，那么考虑不要削减那么多卡路里。也许可以从300卡路里的劣势开始。希望这有所帮助！

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories. Not much to say here. The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly. I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them. “Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.” To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular. I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on? Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline? “Sure, OP. I am saving money to move.” This is really rare. My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever. Where is she moving? To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry. I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer! It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work. So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city. She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine. Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.

ASSISTANT: 最近，木星星球终于离开了我办公室的太阳系。几年前，我在故事中提到了我办公室的敌人，一个名叫木星星球的女人。这里没什么好说的。在新冠之前，我最后一次看到她时，她减掉了一些体重，似乎在吃午餐时有些注意食品组合，虽然她仍然使用电车椅和有些臭。我问她怎么样，就像我问所有同事一样。“不太好，OP，我发现自己患有糖尿病，所以我必须吃少一些碳水化合物。”轻微地说，她的午餐有菜藕米代替了正常的米饭。我是一个中西部人，一直都很友好地对待PJ的脸，所以我告诉她，很难，这个项目我们两个都在努力完成，她也会在法院截止日期之前加班吗？“当然，OP。我正在节省钱，准备搬迁。”这是非常罕见的。我州的人口外流率是任何时候都是最低的。她要去哪里搬？去另一个中西部城市，那里有很多与牛业有关的工作。希望她没有被误认为是公牛！结果，我和其他人记录了她的慢速/差的工作，昏睡在办公桌前，扰乱他人，臭味等等，导致她失去了与我和其他人一起经常被雇佣的公司的所有职位，除了一个。因此，她必须搬到那个城市的家人那里。她将在那里破坏另一个工作场所，但至少不是在我的办公室。现在这并不重要了，因为我获得了一份更好的远程职位。

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago. Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act. Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence. Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement. Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations. Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement." All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground. Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out. It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns. We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again. We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said. Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019. Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU. "We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure. The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said. Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring Got just the one Christmas tree? Then you could be behind the times. This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring. More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol. Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia. Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours. Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself." British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites. Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees." Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more. Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep." Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber. Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response. In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state." He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era. "Christmas can be a pretty stressful time. A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things. That is always good for sleep."

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates. France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates. Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table... We also signed the contract with the Greeks. Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon." The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates. The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning. Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty." This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

ASSISTANT: 法国对于美国驱逐舰的竞争性报价对希腊的反应 The 法国和希腊的防务部门都确认，来自美国的竞争性报价将不会对已经“签署”并“最终”的数十亿美元的购买法国Belharra驱逐舰的协议产生影响。 法国国防部周六表示，与希腊的防务合同已经“几天前初步签署”，而美国国务院宣布批准出售美国驱逐舰的潜在销售之前。 由于我们一直在与希腊人谈论，美国的提议不再有效……我们也已经与希腊签署了合同。希腊防务部也确认，与巴黎的协议是“最终”的，因为它已经在“最高层次”谈判，并由希腊总理基里亚科斯·米托塔基斯“个人宣布”。 最终的合同待希腊议会“很快”批准。 美国国防安全合作局周五表示，已批准向希腊出售四艘霍兰公司战斗驱逐舰，以及一个独立的25亿美元项目，用于升级希腊的MEKO级驱逐舰。 该宣布引发了对雅典-巴黎协议的一些担忧，尤其是在法国和澳大利亚之间长期存在的潜艇建造“世纪协议”在9月突然被AUKUS协议搁置，而没有任何先前的通知。 愤怒的巴黎指责华盛顿和堪培拉背叛了他们，而且仅仅两周后，马克龙与希腊总理登台宣布至少三艘法国战舰将出售给雅典，价值约35亿美元，说这是“停止天真”的时候，并宣称新协议是“欧洲战略自主和主权”的象征。 这一次，根据法国军队，美国“已经警告我们，这个宣布即将发布”，并且美国人“没有意愿进一步”实际出售他们的驱逐舰。

Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders. I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question. I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc. I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question. He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping. He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily. I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone. I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it. He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away. How was I supposed to have known he needed help? He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite. This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help. He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.

Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation. Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings. Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power. There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow. Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported. A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall. Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital. Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency. The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes. Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road. Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said. Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow.

We had power go out a couple of times. Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately. They are security now. Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands). Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there. Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again. Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave. As well as every cart brought to the front. Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce. Step 6: Return said cold/produce. Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc. Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out. (Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go). It's really dark, even upfront. No way can we let customers just hang out. I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't. Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay. I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later. One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on. They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen. I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could. Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.

ASSISTANT: 我们有几次电力中断。步骤1：立即派员守门。他们现在是保安。不要让任何人进入，并注意人们离开时的情况（特别是孩子们的手）。步骤2：如果他们不在，请打电话给店长。步骤3：那些在现金售货台和其他人可以等待几分钟，看看备用发电机是否可以重新启动我们。步骤4：在店铺中穿遍，让每个非员工离开。同时，将每辆车停在前面。步骤5：穿遍购物车，寻找任何冷冻和生鲜食品。步骤6：返回所有冷冻和生鲜食品。步骤7：覆盖所有非门的冷冻食品，例如奶酪、肉和蔬菜等。步骤8：在离开前在一张纸上签名，以便记录下我们的出勤时间。（一些人被允许早退，特别是如果他们不舒服在黑暗中或还有6小时的工作时间）。这里非常黑暗，绝对不能让顾客继续待在这里。我不确定为什么一些现金售货台仍然有一些电力，而其他售货台则没有。不确定，但我认为我们没有任何方法让他们支付。我认为商品可以扫描，但没有任何方法让顾客后续支付。一次，电力仅在3小时内恢复。他们让几个我们留下来，以便如果电力按照电力公司的预测恢复，我们可以重新开放。我不介意，只要我们有留下或离开的选择，尽力保存产品，我都可以帮忙。但是没有选择的权利，以及危险顾客的情况，我会画出一条界限。

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced. "We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic." He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE. The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy. "If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated. According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list. In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week. According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys. After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game. When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks. The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning. Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury. The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity. This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players. Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups. It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88). Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands. Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts. We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area. Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."

ASSISTANT: 达拉斯牛仔队带上了长椅到华盛顿，对手之间的竞争气氛加热 Dallas 牛仔队在华盛顿的客队席上看起来非常熟悉，因为他们自己带了长椅。在得知其他球队表示 FedEx Field 的客队席上的长椅需要升级的消息后，牛仔队决定为这场比赛准备好自己的长椅。当他们周日到达球场时，他们已经穿上了带有牛仔队标志和字母的长椅。牛仔队听说，最近在周一晚上与华盛顿进行比赛的西雅图海鹰队抱怨称，加热长椅出现了故障。在本周早些时候，牛仔队的运动员 Ezekiel Elliott 也评论了在寒冷的户外比赛中的优势，因为加热长椅对他的膝部伤势有益。牛仔队只是确保 Zeke 和他的队友有这个机会。这一举动只是达拉斯-华盛顿之间的竞争关系的最新转折，这一周牛仔队主教练 Mike McCarthy 预测胜利，引发了华盛顿的 Ron Rivera 和球员之间的一些火花。华盛顿连续两次战胜了牛仔队。自 1986 年至 1988 年以来，华盛顿已经不再在三场比赛中连续战胜达拉斯（1986-88）。牛仔队的球迷在 FedEx Field 的观众席中占据了多数，这可以从观众席上的蓝白队服中看出来。拥有者 Jerry Jones 在本周在达拉斯的 105.3 FM 上表示，“我们一直在销售更多的牛仔队帽子、帽子、T 恤。我们一直在华盛顿获得最多的积极粉丝支持，这是在德克萨斯州以外的地方。除了德克萨斯州以外，华盛顿是我们在所有可能计算的事情上获得最多支持的地方。”

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life' Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected. The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning. The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings. Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services. It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country. More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27. Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7. STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row. The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute. "Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said. A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland. "This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said. "It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime. For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."
