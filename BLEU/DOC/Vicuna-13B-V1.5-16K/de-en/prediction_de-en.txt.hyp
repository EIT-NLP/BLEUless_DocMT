The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the item's value... I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer, so it's not a problem for me. I just need a number or instruction on what I should attach to the package so it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I have to be honest, I find this quite frustrating. Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get a discount?
I also find it fundamentally that children should not be required to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I think it's good for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings to some extent. Looking briefly, helping briefly, bringing the bottle, etc. This way, they learn responsibility, help in the family, and feel involved. As long as they are still young enough to be children themselves, I don't see a problem with that. If your K1 can occupy themselves for a short time and it's okay for them, that's fine. You can best judge yourself whether that works for your children. It's not like K2 needs to be dressed and accompanied for hours before falling asleep. Legally, it's probably questionable. Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes into play. Because if something were to happen like a fire, a break-in, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, your decision ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again! I read a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title for the life of me. Maybe someone here knows something about it... The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and entering his enclosure with his predatory animals. The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, leads to his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear. The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist's clinic. There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of each suicide and document it, and post the photos on the internet. Anyway, it turns out that this therapist runs some kind of underground therapy group where patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses the fear center and the patients end up experiencing their fear to the extreme (a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death). This experiencing of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight". In the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that has something to do with fire. That's the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author / authoress. If this plot is familiar to someone or if someone can even give me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available. I need to contact my husband first. But that may take some time. What steps should I take afterwards?
Is it also possible to receive a refund of the price difference?
Dear Sir/Madam,  I am writing to inform you that our four-year-old child, Kind, has a wooden splinter under the fingernail of their thumb. The splinter extends the entire length of the nail on the outside of the finger. We have tried to remove it with a pair of tweezers, but it was very difficult to grasp and caused pain. Our attempts were unsuccessful, and now the child reacts hysterically whenever we try to remove the splinter. We have given up hope of removing it ourselves and will be taking the child to see a doctor tomorrow.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Sincerely,  [Your Name]

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. Through the combination of a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 scales. LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker with a sound capsule kit. Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder. It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed levels are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions. Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically report to a suitable digital central station. It masters all DCC programming modes, and with RailCom®, compatible central stations can read CV values on the main track. For central stations that can only program CVs from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers. Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels with 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021. The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central stations. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system. Braking with DCC braking blocks or with DC voltage is also possible. In addition, it also holds with a Selectrix® braking diode. An ABC pendulum train automatic allows for automatic pendulum between two stations. The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC tracks.
After my voucher was not extended due to a complaint that did not arrive, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere, where customer friendliness is prioritized and I don't have to tip-toe around to achieve nothing at all! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson will accelerate booster vaccinations New Omikron cases are providing politics and science in Great Britain. Therefore, by New Year's Eve, all eligible adults in England should receive a booster vaccination offer. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to proceed faster with coronavirus booster vaccinations than previously planned in view of the rapidly increasing number of Omikron cases. Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening. So far, the target date was the end of January. The British government will also support accelerating vaccination campaigns in the country's regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. "We are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, which is why the vaccination protection must be strengthened urgently," Johnson said. The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third vaccination dose. "Get vaccinated now!" Johnson said. On Sunday, 1,239 more Omikron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3,137, an increase of 65 percent compared to the previous day. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent in an application. Today, I received an invitation for an interview via email. I want to respond to the email. Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman. **I have no idea how to write the email now. Can someone please help me? ** I am a foreigner and do not want to step on any officials' toes. Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them work. Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale. How could such a foam damage occur otherwise after 9 months?
First, I tried on the #PRS\_ORG#. But that hasn't worked for about 14 days now. So I've been buying the last books on the website and then reading them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were none available. Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and have it charged to my account.
The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will write here about domestic violence in more detail. I just need to get something off my chest. I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons. A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we can't help them. I am clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect. But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in these situations. I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach them all. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it. What I always want to make clear, sometimes very close to tears, is that everyone deserves to live without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to tolerate violence. I often wish I could help... I know I can't. It will never be easier that way, but please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends" worth?

Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, held up for the Riesen. For the second time in less than three months, Ludwigsburg lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with hindsight on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs." But that didn't settle after the game - instead, it escalated in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. More than the bare result, it was the manner of the appearance that was disappointing. A statistic that sums up the entire dilemma can be cited: the three-point percentage was just 13 percent, four baskets (all from the young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any questions? The answer came from John Patrick: "We weren't concentrated enough after our win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we trained for - moving the ball." His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "It was great to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people." Although only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they made up for it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game for his team. "The best playmaker I've ever trained," Gleim added. While in Patrick's team, even the key players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to deliver. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a complete disaster and came within eight points after they had already trailed 39:59. Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points. Fortunately, there won't be much time for complaining. The Riesen will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (6 pm) and then play in Ludwigsburg in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself several months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again for this reason. We originally registered ourselves half a year ago.
Always peeled like an egg: Max Raabe will be 59 and he is able to enchant his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s. Currently, he is on the road with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he is allowed to perform at all. Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. However, this has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus. Other performances he had planned for the Advent season also had to be postponed, as stated on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians ([www.palast-orchester.de](http://www.palast-orchester.de)). From January, the artists then want to catch up on the performances that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe sang a lot and enthusiastically as a youth. In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students. Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlagers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded numerous prizes. His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) - like his successful album "For Women, That's No Problem" (2013) - reached second place in the charts. He has succeeded in moving from the niche to the mainstream. Always impeccably dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and on his best behavior, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable in the current German-speaking music scene. With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance? It can be added to existing furniture and we can check in advance whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only fold the cover sheet but not flip through the pages.
Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new apartments. The new Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment conglomerates, as has been demanded in a Berlin popular vote. "Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the structure of ownership," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years. A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission to deal with how to handle the result of the popular vote. If the situation does not improve, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rental mirror. I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible. If the rental market does not improve nonetheless, "we will talk with the coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I realized a few days later that I forgot to make the last payment. Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock? Or if it will be available again at all? #PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm).
Coupon sounds great. Then I'll redeem it independently at the new order. Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take by itself?
I have already cut myself on my finger. That is an absolute cheekiness.
At least 100 dead through tornadoes in Kentucky. A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to sweep across the USA. In Kentucky alone, it is feared that more than 100 people may have lost their lives. The pictures from there remind one of a war zone. In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several tornadoes caused severe damage in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives. The storms left a roughly 200-mile-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky. Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone wherever the tornado had passed. Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is hard to imagine that this is even possible. He estimates that in the state of Kentucky alone, there may be up to a hundred deaths, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# display case is sold out. That's very unfortunate. Will it be produced again? Or has it been completely removed from the product line? Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you sign up? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
As I understand it, I can only order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had submitted a return request through the contact form and wanted to follow up to inquire if it was received or being processed, as I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for vaccination. In doing so, they are in line with social partners ÖGB and WKO, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination today. The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - is also intended to increase willingness to be vaccinated against COVID-19.
He switched to a different company where he complained about. That doesn't make his situation any better than yours. Wait and drink tea. It's been a year now. He obviously didn't get attached to his old position and looked for something else. You can do that too. And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares? He didn't like his job either. There are too many variables.
Please take note of the cancellation. This will then be legally relevant. I will take a screenshot.

Help with my first own campaign Boron greetings! I am currently leading an adventure "Over the Greifenpass" for a group of 4 friends and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specially written for the players. We play DSA 5. The big bow is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am writing the introductory adventure and I am already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes should bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea. The further course of the action should then develop there. A few miles from the village, the heroes should be ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into a trap. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, intimidating, recognizing the danger in time, whatever the players come up with. Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed. If the heroes do not notice, the goblins will lie in wait for them in a ditch and flank the wagon to the left and right with three bows each, while two with spears stop the wagon. If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions: 1. The heroes are all unconscious and are then found and healed by the son of the village schoolteacher, a half-elf. The wagon is, of course, gone. 2. If a defeat is unavoidable, the half-elf with two of his henchmen intervenes and comes to the heroes' aid in the fight. The wagon is still there, everything is fine. How do you guys feel about solution 2 as Deus ex Machina? Is the encounter as the starting adventure too much? The group of goblins will play a significant role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder. EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely incorporate many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart and put it back together again. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Therefore, I would still like to return it. Could you then arrange for the return labels to be sent so that I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

We didn't make the chair. Suddenly, the tear was there. I was just sitting on it.
Here was the lower part, so to speak, the part with the damaged storage space. Will everything then be collected again or only the storage space part?
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, today during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted midway to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the starting accident threw the schedule far behind schedule, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!). Apparently, however, it is so that F1 has priority for legal reasons, so everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here probably had no choice. Nevertheless, stupid, all the more since Sky UK was able to broadcast the race to the end. Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was F1 again confusion about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton. Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such elementary rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something is possible or required, both have constant uncertainties in the rules. Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that taste is subjective. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter in particular brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, the advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the out-lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, only the German soundtrack without commentary is necessary directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. Of course, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, apart from the advertising. Thus, the great F1 season makes much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster. I would like to hear your opinion.

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered. I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing has happened. The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady said yesterday that she would check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair). I kindly request your support.
Fans are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filter system using air pumps. We offer this series in 3 variants. Please see the end of the offer to compare the performances. If the pumps are powerful enough, entire systems can be operated with them. If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that more outlets can be connected. The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. Fans are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find it in our shop) or with decor that converts air bubbles into a function, such as a treasure chest, shell, or similar. The MK series has a special sound-dampening construction and thus ensures low operating noise. The installation is very easy. The fan pump is connected to an outlet via a 4/6 mm air hose... and off you go. The fan pump should be at the same height or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside the aquarium. If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between it and the outlet to prevent water from flowing back through the pump... If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps in the MK series are pure power packages and consume little energy. Although we indicate the processing time on eBay as 3 days, we pack and ship daily, and the packages are also picked up daily. If everything goes smoothly, delivery is very fast. We just want to prevent anyone from being disappointed if delivery sometimes takes a little longer. Not everyone understands all the employees who also work in logistics... of course, this is not due to Corona. Please do not judge the seller negatively just because delivery is delayed. This is solely due to the package services. People naturally like to complain about these services, even though we say... they are having a hard time right now. This varies greatly depending on the region. Please do not be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order yellow with and without armrests? Can the legs also be ordered in light color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and TV host into space The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space. They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas. Under a radiantly blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return, dressed in a blue spacesuit. "Welcome back," said Bezos as he opened the hatch to the capsule. With applause from friends, family members, and Blue Origin employees, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were in space for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were the guests of honor of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets. Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the short flight. He had worked hard on his missions and had to do everything himself. She was just along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic. He would love to go back to space again, said the host. "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically. The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, briefly experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely. The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above Earth to be the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned space flight for Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman. On the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was on board, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely pursuing the business of space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should continuously glow in one color or play through its entire color range. When the color change is activated, the light stone stays in a light color for about a minute before softly transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light lasts all year round outdoors. In a snowy environment, its light is particularly good - just keep in mind that the battery life will be shortened as the days get shorter in winter.

Someone who works in biochemistry or is studying biochemistry: I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting, and I am not bothered by working in the lab (I have already completed my inorganic chemistry practical). Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, thinking that I would definitely want to study until I got my PhD, and I still do. However, I am now having doubts, especially concerning the career prospects. On the one hand, you always hear about great career opportunities and how the profession is in high demand (Studycheck, etc.), but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really like to know: 1) What do you currently do? 2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary? 3) What did you study/what kind of training did you do? 4) Would you do it all over again? Thank you very much for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and doing a training program to become a IT specialist. If you have any experiences in this area, please share them as well :)
Extra Stress for Holidays and Weekend Holidays  This topic came up for me last week. However, I had to use my long weekend to relax from it. That's why I'm posting about it now. Not only before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, is there stress in our company. As it turns out, there is also stress before holidays and bridge days. It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland. Most people and businesses take a bridge day on Friday, making it a semi-official day off. Last week, therefore, there was a long four-day weekend. What happened last week? Everywhere stress. Endless emails that had to be sent before Ascension, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend. Why? Because... well, because "next week then" after so much time doesn't sound right and can't be allowed? Or because people really want to accomplish as much in a short week as in a normal week? Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also pretty annoyed. What is this self-imprisonment because of holidays for? Why do we have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly? The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent about it. My question is simply: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss? Is this our reformed-evangelical way? Or do you know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet. "The nice thing is, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH. She will get into the festive spirit by baking gingerbread with her son and making mulled wine. "I love that," said Catterfeld. However, until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I haven't bought any gifts yet, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth shedding process and feather regrowth. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg. NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage. The majority of feather damage that occurs in bird keeping are due to nutritional errors exclusively. Since the feathers consist of protein-containing substances, the formation of flawless feathers requires a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird. For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. A large part of the animal losses that occur during the shedding period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals. The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs and balances it out. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparations should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through the drinking water or mixed with soft food.
Thank you, I found it but unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts have been delivered to me. However, there were problems with one of the parts. The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them. What do we do now? I cannot assemble the bed. The middle beam is held by two feet, which are unfortunately defectively produced. The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder. So I will receive new ones. When will they be shipped? No, there are no flat ones. These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones, they were just too narrow. But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose. At my place, they are not flat. Could I receive these parts again? Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria. In addition, an estimated damage in the five-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire is believed to have spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson. The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
That comes later, but I still have to pay shipping costs.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo Uğur Şahin, CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based Biontech, published a photo of his first COVID-19 vaccination on the social network LinkedIn in early 2021. So far, the entrepreneur had not publicly expressed his opinion on his vaccination status. Now he has published a photo that shows him receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. The illness of a friend moved him to do so, he shared. In social media, there were false rumors that I was not vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on LinkedIn on Friday. "For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of me being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors. So far, I have refused because the communication should not revolve around me. But a call last week changed my mind: "I was deeply saddened when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks. My friend and his family are not vaccinated," Şahin wrote further. He did not ask about the reasons. "The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust. Fear is hard to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences," he added. In the internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle circulates in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified. "It is currently not legally allowed for me to receive the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time. There is a prioritization in Germany for vaccination. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Thousands of people without power  Thousands of people in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia were left without power on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases also no heating. A fire had rendered a substation inoperable. After a fire with severe damage to a substation, thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to cope without electricity for around 24 hours. On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally fully resolved late in the evening. Firefighters and aid workers from the THW provided assistance in the municipalities. The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked those affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.  "We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions. We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said the head of the Primary Technology Department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will still take several days, as Westnetz technicians were able to restore some cables only provisionally, he explained. A technical defect led to the fire, according to company information. Electricity is flowing again  The fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 PM heavily damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the substation in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid, according to Westnetz. There, extensive cleaning and repair work will be necessary. In parallel, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created. Thanks to this bypass, electricity supply is restored. Since 6 PM on Saturday, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 8:30 PM. Since 10:15 PM, even the last affected people had electricity again. Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed. The authorities had also called for neighborhood help after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday morning. "Now it's important that citizens take care of each other in their neighborhood, especially for older or single people, and inform the local fire stations when help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting. The focus was mainly on providing power to residents of nursing homes during the setup and operation of emergency power generators. In addition, temporary childcare places were set up in schools for people who could not take care of themselves or who needed strom-dependent medical devices or were dependent on medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros? It is the Tagesdecke #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a nice day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the underside on the tabletop. It is a custom #NAME#. There are three versions available. We wanted the one with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#. We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today I received my #PRS\_ORG#, but I cannot shorten it by overlapping it and therefore it is not suitable for the purpose. Can you help me with this? Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it would otherwise not be suitable. I would appreciate a response.
Sure, that's much easier! Then we'll do it like this: Please send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried that before the chat. But before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS\_ORG#. Should I do that now?
I find such a low credit note almost impolite. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins again  German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have once again been beaten by the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia. Riiber, who had a significant lead after the ski jumping, easily won the race.
Reverse of order number #NUMBER# When will the money be credited back to my account?
Sure, here's the translation:  "We both have s new and use version 4.5... it could be that they have often heard of problems."
I bought a book directly from my #PRS\_ORG#, it seems to be the case. As soon as I want to open it, the message appears, ups! This document cannot be opened. The file may be defective, please contact customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can they help me?
"Chat connection is down and now? I also have to work in between!"
To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clear water, and let them dry. Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes. You can do this on the inside of the parts that will not be visible later or on a yogurt cup. When applying the first coat of paint to the part, draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke. Overlapping the layers of paint slightly later creates a uniform surface. Avoid quickly wiping the brush back and forth, as this creates unrealistic-looking surfaces. A model is not a fence. Start with the lighter colors, as the darker ones may otherwise show through later. Metallic tones and metallic colors should be applied last with a separate brush. Otherwise, unattractive metallic streaks may occur when they mix with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before painting them. The models achieve their original appearance through decals or stickers. From emblems on aircraft to ship names, to decorative stripes and license plates on model cars: the decals give the model the final touch. Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible. A cockpit of an aircraft can be attached or glued more easily before it is installed in the fuselage. More important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpick, is time, patience, and a steady hand when applying the decals. Cut each required decal individually and place it in the correct position. Decals are also called water slide decals because you moisten the back of the decal with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture. Then, you slide the decal only a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand). While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, you gently pull the carrier paper sideways away. Attention: Always check first if the decal is in the right position before completely removing it from the paper, so it does not stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear. Remove excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look for something else, I can no longer read and have to log out and log back in and find the place where I left off reading. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive this by email? Even for all 3 packages? Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Okay, thank you anyway! I will buy it somewhere else as soon as I get my money back. Will I get the problem-free one back?
Treatment of desire to have children with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"? Hello everyone, we were in fertility treatment for a while, and now that it comes to settling with the private health insurance, it suddenly goes sideways. In order: We had applied for fertility treatment in advance with the private health insurance and received the approval for 3 attempts. The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.). The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with the private health insurance. Some time later, we tried to have a second child and carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not settle them with the private health insurance. We applied again for cost coverage with the private health insurance and received 3 more attempts approved. After carrying out several more attempts (we had more attempts than approved, of course, we settle the most expensive ones with the private health insurance) we submitted the invoices to the private health insurance and received the bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the private health insurance only wants to reimburse 3 attempts. The reason: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first approval expire. The desire for a second child is a new insurance case. According to the GTC, however, "The insurance case begins with the medical treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists." The questions for the experts in the round here: * Who is right here, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)? * Should the private health insurance have pointed out in the approvals that the remaining attempts would expire with a birth? * Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? Unfruitfulness (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child. It would be great if the experts here would give their opinion. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how to best achieve them?
In Order. We will no longer place orders with them. When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), it is clear that they have lost a good customer. They are welcome to pass this on to their manager. This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now he's telling me that I have to return the item first. I can't do anything about the fact that the commode was completely disturbed when it arrived at my place. Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote. It clearly states that the repayment was initiated and I still haven't received any repayment through #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment from his account. We will no longer do this. No, the defect only occurred after a few months. A desk chair should be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they should not sell it as a desk chair. Regardless, the warranty is 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in that way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG promoted products. Are these products being advertised in addition to purchasing hookers, which we unfortunately cannot find with you. Can you help?
Theme of the week: The best low budget films  What exactly is a low budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget limits. Wikipedia has the following to say about it: >A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of lists of low budget films, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category? What do you like about them? And what do you not like at all?
I am a very satisfied customer of yours and have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. Has the delivery time been extended again? Is it now also reliable? Thank you very much.  Best regards.  Gibts keine Telefonnummer, ein Chat, wo man 30min warten muss, ist kein Chat! Leider ändert sich nichts an der Warteposition...ich gebe dann bald wieder mal auf, weil es einfach nicht funktioniert hier. Hallo
Half victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU. According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime. However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd). The EU has not fundamentally resolved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP). This situation - Belarus is not completely defeated, but the EU feels like a winner - will probably continue for some time. The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged. Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole does not turn against this, it goes at the expense of fundamental rights. This development also weakens the cohesion in the union. "She can apparently not enforce her will when a member state decides to do things its own way," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border. In addition, the EU is paying a price for its border policy with Belarus: The principle of agreeing on asylum policy will be made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Migrants have again attempted to cross the border, according to reports from Poland's border guard. 55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border overnight on Sunday, said a spokeswoman for the agency on Sunday. Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by migrants during the incident. According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers. Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU. Poland and Lithuania, according to press reports, have sealed off border sections. The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country. In addition, EU commissioners are traveling to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure. The most effective element of the EU's reaction is the pressure on airlines, Bossong said. "The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and has demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial measures." Minsk must also consider the internal political costs. The Belarusian society is probably not used to the security apparatus regularly smuggling thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale. According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen should have committed two rule violations during the race. Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest. The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest refers to an alleged breach of the rules by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly. A second protest has been lodged against the scoring at the end of the race. According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed regulation-compliant. Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and won his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I am checking that. I am speaking with the bank and will report back to you. Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag  The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park stadium of Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited members and season ticket holders of the club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, to visit the park for free on the SC Freiburg Fantag. According to the park's announcement, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages. The roller coaster trains glowed in red and white on this day, and foxes, Ed Euromaus, and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park. The partnership between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 1990s. The first SC Freiburg Fantag at the Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership fits. Shining fans enjoying the roller coaster together confirm this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

I had a huge problem with you back then when I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# commode.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home" as part of the "LiteraTour North" reading series. The author read from her current novel "At Home" and also acted as moderator on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note. She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens sensitively to the nighttime sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your idiotic chat and poorly delivered cheap goods from China. That's your mistake, not everyone's in our household. Contact Mrs. #NAME#. I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday in a chat that I, or Mrs. #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return shipping label. This email has not arrived yet. I would like to deliver the package to #PRS\_ORG# today. Please contact me. Best regards.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true. That's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners. They won't accept you either. But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it go completely. Wow, then you're just as unserious as Kollegah. Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is simply completely lost. As far as I'm concerned, God started it all. But if you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spreading nonsense. And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically planar-achromatic lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and color errors up to the edge zone. Often loupes are marked with magnification specifications. However, these specifications only apply to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use. In order to be able to use your loupe optimally, we kindly ask you to follow the information in the table "Technical Data" (see instructions for use in the packaging). Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact loupes. These reflections are significantly reduced by an anti-reflection coating. If the optimal conditions of use are observed - the loupe close to the eye - the reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. Further information can be found in the enclosed instructions for use (available in German and English).  The Zeiss VisuCard loupe is the ideal helper, whether as a reading aid on the go or simply for everyday small print. Its compact size makes it easy to take it with you anywhere. And its hard coating makes it robust against special strains of everyday life. Each loupe comes with a check card case for safe storage and transport. They offer these parts, which you can see in the images or under "What do they offer" described.  In which condition is the offered article? Of course, anyone can overlook something, because no one is free from errors - if this is the case, simply write a message and it will be resolved to your satisfaction (either by exchange, partial refund or full refund). You will receive a proper invoice. Shipping is always sent, unless expressly requested otherwise by the buyer, insured with tracking number by DHL! The individual shipping costs can be found in the above shipping conditions. There are no additional handling fees.
All authors agree, how can I check more precisely? Yes, both the email address.
#PRS\_ORG# I will provide a much nicer and better service, although it took a while to get to a human, you were great.
Hello dear #PRS\_ORG# team, I have already reported to you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called something else before. You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
Fir Tree Sale in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women search for Christmas trees. Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations during the fir tree sale. Once, a man even drove home alone without his partner because they couldn't agree. Every year, the 56-year-old plants around 2000 trees for this purpose. He has already experienced many curious situations, he says, which make the pre-Christmas period a bit funny.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, I'll be lost as a customer! After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it. So I'll rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both therefore have their name. In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which certainly doesn't sound as delicious.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic  We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks. Unfortunately, I am now having trouble building a stable Wi-Fi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures. The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox, these are also received. However, at the other DLan module that transmits the Wi-Fi, only a fraction of the full 500 Mbit comes through, and the more I move away from the module with the device (e.g., using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away), the less comes through (i.e., a socket that is further away from the other module). This leads to the internet with the new fiber optic connection now being slower in the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but here too, there were similar losses. Could someone explain why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with fiber optic? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to lay more LAN cables in the house. I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created this account. Therefore, I would be all the more grateful for a response.
When it's time to switch to a current account, who would have thought that there would be peace and quiet with current accounts, is being proven wrong. While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their customers' fee increases from the past with various tricks, the free balances for negative interest rates are also falling further. The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now they have simply halved the free balance and even quadrupled it for savings accounts. In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the group's Postbank division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts. However, these lower limits now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request - not only for new contracts but also for "newly agreed individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the ING Deutschland. The DKB, a direct bank popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered its free balances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks now have a free balance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the online portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer organizations there, which even won in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation. Now the banks are already discussing whether the institutions should form reserves - in case the higher instances declare negative interest in principle to be illegal and have to pay millions back to bank customers.
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston leads a whole beauty army and is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood. However, her life is like a roller coaster. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year. For her, who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is mainly the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance. Anyway, as Aniston says, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: just one chip from the bag). That the hearts of both male and female fans still fly to her is actually a miracle. Perhaps because she simply has bad luck - and is still looking for her big love. And has crossed off the baby wish list. Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. That hurt her. The people who asked have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. Hopefully, success and fame will also bring happiness.
Undeserving end to a career: Räikkönen has to retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 ended quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finnish driver took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it. After a driving mistake and a slight tire rub, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after less than half of the race distance in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, ending his career in the motorsport royal class. His wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates for his farewell. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich achieves 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot. "I've calculated that, I would have to average nine and a half wins per season, then I could do it by Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg. First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, moving from third to first. Then he changed something in the material setting and won by 0.30 seconds on Sunday with a larger lead. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat Briton Brad Hall. Third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd win in a row. Johannes Lochner from Stuttgart, who finished second this time, moved up to fifth. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach, who finished fourth in the first race, finished eighth in the second race. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner. Nolte with home win - Podium for Jamanka In the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bob on her home track. After only fourth place in the Monobob the day before, she won the World Cup victory on Sunday with her pusher Deborah Levi as part of Germany's triple success. Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen, with Germany's fastest sprinter Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, finished second. She not only qualified for the Olympics but also achieved her first podium finish this winter. The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig. "It was super cool, my first podium in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me along. I'm super happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential to come, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, there's a lot to do around it as well." Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the slightly flawed runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now! What should I do?
I have not received it either and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked. Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had the time for it. And now it said it had expired, which made me very angry. Look in the chat, it was about the Asare Sitzbank.
I want to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipment only started on March 16th when there was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website?
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
The document has been translated from German to English:  "The item was collected yesterday from your colleague. Why is it a problem today? I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered item."
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one, not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear wonderful girls and women, I have something I just want to write and maybe it will help someone else too... I am 24 years old, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child 1-on-1. My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, he burned himself 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice. I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to the burn)
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color and surface is scratched and the table leg has a print. In the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website. We are very disappointed!!!! What can you offer me? If we now exchange the table, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#. In any case, it was sent twice. However, it was not confirmed.
There was so much more to it: I realized in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject like math or geography for them. For me, that was always strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed. What do you think? Maybe you can also talk about coworkers or classmates with different attitudes. Basically, I understand the difference between private and professional and it's important to separate them. There's also a curriculum and so on. But I find it strange that a physics teacher wouldn't believe in the theory of relativity. What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? To preserve culture or something? I hope my question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Write in English, I understand it well That has been like this for a long time, then I would give up on it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a response soon, no later than the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hello dear people, I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24). I believe it was a film for young people. In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern (real world). On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). In the real world, there is a young woman. And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a plot develops. The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can live himself, I think. The transition, I believe, is also the grave of the soldier. At the end, both soldiers fight against each other. If this interests you, I would be grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach from week 1. Fast forward: still alive :D Relax. Such a child can hold out much more than you think. Make sure everything around it is okay, no cuddly toys, go in more often to look, but no continuous monitoring. That drives you crazy! Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows. Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket. Observe your child when they sleep. Turns their head to the side? Can they lift themselves up from their stomach? Or lies facing down directly in the mattress? You can tell from that whether everything is okay. We are also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids to sleep on their stomachs.
Furthermore, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have purchased many articles. But why are you then only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It concerns my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe. I kindly request that you contact me as soon as possible. The wardrobe is currently not usable in its current state.
To put it bluntly, RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know not everything can be kept. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV. But it's just that the politics of this broadcaster are now under everyone's nose. Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then they go on a big begging tour at the same time. It was said that they wanted to be an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a permanent billboard." What are they now? An 0815 advertising broadcaster trying to sell their merchandise to the elite fan. And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne. They can continue to insult people. A Krogmann who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes out of the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action. How can one find all of this acceptable? Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I am requesting a recall, as the wooden table delivered to me is defective. The body is damaged due to a damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
As a comfort aid for stomachaches or simply for cuddling – my little heat friend is versatile. Cherry pit cushions are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat well and release it again in doses. The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven. The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good. The cherry pit cushion with cover is exclusively intended as a warmth application for the following areas of use: Before warming the cushion, check for unusual odors, stains, or burn marks, and dispose of them immediately if present. Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up! In the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions!). After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking it. Then place the inner cushion back in the cover. At the surface, there may be a slight moisture formation at first, but this will disappear with repeated applications. Please follow the specified heating instructions, as longer heating times or higher power outputs can lead to damage (risk of fire and burns!). Before warming the cushion in the microwave, check the user manual of the manufacturer to see if the heating of grain products is allowed. After placing the warmed inner cushion back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion on your wrist to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C). Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory complaints, fresh bruises, bleeding, and open wounds, as well as for people with reduced pain perception. In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases, as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use. If the seams have opened and the cherry pits are coming out, dispose of the product and the loose pits immediately and inaccessibly for children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the baby's temperature should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating! All serious incidents that have occurred in connection with the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority in the country where the user resides. The cover is removable and can be washed at 30°C in a washing machine. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar. For Ingolstadt, things are not going well even under the third coach. Joy in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, happiness in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply. I bought this power supply about 5 months ago, so it should still work. I thought the power supply alone would be enough for operation. Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the power supply plugged in. Therefore, I removed the battery, but nothing happened. Maybe you have some ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation? Is something else broken? Thank you very much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to be brought to my room. How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment? With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem! The 20-liter capacity swallows even larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be securely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers. And everything else you need in everyday life remains well organized in the individually configurable interior thanks to practical accessories. With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The chic, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment. This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, a well-thought-out solution that has already proven itself in messenger bags. The locking hook is made of metal and has matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are four anchor bars, firmly attached, into which the locking hook can be hooked. If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take out the top bar, if it is rather empty, take out a deeper one. The lid closure and hook are also magnetic. This means that the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook rattling. The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks in a fundamental way: in addition to the lid closure, there is a zippered opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday practicality of the backpack: if you don't just take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you, you can individually configure the interior of the Everyday Backpack (more on this below) and thus stow everything problem-free and separate from each other - and also access it independently through the two side openings. This way, you can also reach for the camera equipment on the right-hand side of the backpack, while your everyday items remain safely in the left-hand half of the backpack and don't get in the way. Comfortable, easy-to-adjust shoulder straps help with this. And since the outer material of the backpack is also made entirely of 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents remain dry even when it's raining in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the email from their support. #NAME# informed me by email yesterday of confirmation of the commissioning of the contact by the shipping company for the collection of the incorrectly delivered table. So far, I have not received any message. I kindly request immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support member, with none of whom I have progressed beyond the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation. It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#.
It needs to be determined when the cabinet could be delivered again? Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on January 12th, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will place a larger order, but in any case, I will keep the damaged piece of furniture and not send it back. And that the past year did not go as planned, I could not have imagined and could not have redeemed and clarified it in a timely manner. But the damage as a customer, I do not accept that.

Coloma is the city that an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining nuggets in the water at the southern fork of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country. Areas were surveyed, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land. For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding riverbeds and adjacent areas. You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must outdo your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them. Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory. You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or turn rules in your favor. With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style with fine-tuning. Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds. During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their choice is revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock! This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return. The auctioneer rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, thus changing the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, i.e., has covered each location once, and the year ends. There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits. If the players have contributed enough gunfighters and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards. If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery. The game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place. The player with the most victory points wins! With free shipping, I take up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method "Warensendung (Spiele einfoliert)". For everything else, it is usually DPD insured and with shipment tracking (Spiele einfoliert, with flies wrapped and packaging paper). If you are a collector, I can also send in a box within a box for an additional charge of 2 euros, ensuring 100% no pressure points.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it. >The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on child-rearing. Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him. >Please be careful, the film is very difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. Parents and other responsible parties must never, never, never use power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and make the framework for the child as large as possible, given the situation and feasibility. Brrr, it still shakes me up.
Holetschek: Countries consulting on the abolition of testing obligation for triple vaccinated The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing obligation for triple vaccinated at their next meeting. "We need quick clarity on whether and when the testing obligation can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag". The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," Holetschek said. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to "present a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference already on Tuesday," - afp
Also, I want to return the lamp. How should I proceed best?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me?
I am unable to complete any purchases through my #PRS\_ORG# account. Error message: Oh no, an error has occurred. Purchasing through the #PRS\_ORG# website on my computer is working. I have updated my account details. What could be the cause of this?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000. Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain. For this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased risk of awareness, as one avoids deep anesthesia to protect the child until weaning. Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk. **EDIT: Dear all, my comment describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition. I misread their comment.**
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help either. Those are legal warranty claims. The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair. That is, besides the legal obligation, also standard in the field of eCommerce. Please check again if they are willing to take back the defective chair at least. Then we can sell the second chair privately. We will also lose a lot of money that way.
I already sent you an email which you did not reply to. Again, the question. In the order and on the invoice, it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The carrier is company #NAME#. I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS\_ORG#. Is that correct? If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor. I won't be called either, will I? I formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He made a name for himself as a theater critic and later as an intendant. Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97. There is still a new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man grows older." It is a terrifying diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021. And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I want to testify here already my life's gratitude."
There are different types of pallets. One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area. They are certified by the European Pallet Association (EPAL). In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria, with a production value of around 79 million euros. The number of pallets imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

Beef Tips & Tricks I received a lot of great tips last week for the perfect goulash. It was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery! So thank you again for that :) Now I'm on to the taste and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I will prepare a beef broth for it. Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next? What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English may not be as good, but I'll figure it out.
The text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund was made. However, the money has not yet been received in my account. Please check this.
For many people, goose or duck are part of the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts. Have you not yet bought any poultry? Time is running out. We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can not only set the desired level, but also adjust the distortion of your sounds. Furthermore, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL control, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion. As mentioned earlier, the POWER LEVEL control can even be used to create a power reserve when it gets too loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL control, you can fully utilize the potential of the VT+ series in any situation. The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal connected to it is processed with a boxing simulation, so you can get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings. The AUX input can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam along to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board, so you don't need a separate tuner. If you also get a VFS5 foot switch, you can conveniently call up sounds, turn effects on and off, and adjust the tempo of compatible effects with your foot. For live use, this is practically indispensable. With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I have seen this with others. Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back? As it is too low hanging over the dining table? Then I would like to send it back. Can you help me with that?
And the wardrobe? Will we receive another update in the next few weeks on the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with an inheritance or voucher. Under certain circumstances, I might even find a buyer for the furniture. However, I don't want to pay more than 1,000 euros for items that I don't need.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in talks on nuclear agreement  According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are about to agree on the topics on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna. This is a "positive and important development," he said, because at the beginning there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement were resumed on Thursday after a brief interruption of just under a week. Participating in the talks are negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia. A US delegation is also in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state now has highest coronavirus incidence Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide. As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had the corona incidence on Sunday above the mark of 1000. The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day incidence rate with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence nationwide, the value was on Sunday at 990.5. On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but had also been above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 further deaths in connection with an infection were reported in one day. 200 severely ill with Covid-19 were treated in hospitals with intensive medical care on Sunday. On weekends, there can be delays in reporting. In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and can hardly keep up with the recording of new cases.
As far as I understand, since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
Do I need to print this and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right? Do I not need to click or fill anything else in?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to kindly request that you cover the cost of returning the item. An 8-euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, outrageous.
It's time for changes ###MBundestag greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day! #Why is this post here? If you look at the activity of the MBundestag in the past few months, you will notice one thing: it is not extinct. We have fallen into a winter stalemate and have extended the summer hole for several months. #Where is the problem? What has caused this? Most likely, it is simply due to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we generally stand. In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many here still have a genuine interest in the MBundestag.  What we need to change At this point, the community around the MBundestag is called upon, those who want to keep it alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the past few days became aware of this project and found a pile of shards. After some back and forth, several people from the community have expressed a desire to rebuild the project. I would like to expressly call upon everyone to participate, only in this way can this project also have a future. We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server via this link. Goals:  * How should the MBundestag function in the future? * What existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future? * How can new members be recruited? * How can we create a fair election system?  I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's not bad, we'll have the Discord at the end. If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste. I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam. Very sad about that. I hope it will be returned and I will get a full refund. This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the #PRS\_ORG# daily towel come in a larger size, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective wardrobe will be picked up promptly. And I kindly request that this be arranged now. I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup - they must clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how this can be done. #PRS\_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time do I have to arrange this and decide on the return?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like. She used to live a vegetarian lifestyle, currently eats meat very rarely. I myself was also a vegetarian for several years. When asked if I always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that is, I used to think that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal cruelty. That's why I decided to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that she was upset on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that vegetarians reduce animal suffering. Now I wonder if my answer was too "simple"? How do you answer this question? I feel like vegans are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without them intending to. It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
This does not constitute an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be able to collect my return at the designated location on the assigned date, as I will be unable to attend due to a funeral. Unfortunately, this cannot be changed. Could I please be assigned an alternative collection date? I will be available again continuously from February 1st #NUMBER#.
Lahnsteiner rescue station equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate  Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a subsidy of 45,000 euros in Lahnstein town hall to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte for the new water rescue vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in security. "I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this matter," says Lahnstein's mayor Peter Labonte. The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate. They perform tasks in water and ice rescue and technical assistance both above and below water. In Lahnstein, it is expected that the number of missions will continue to increase: the boom in hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations, however, I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, but nothing has worked. I am a bit frustrated because the whole process has cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, then that's how it is. I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS\_ORG# collection for June. Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking the time to address this issue. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e., we were both armed forces in the executive branch. I do not want to go into this any further! The question of right and left is always presented in a very simplified way. Fundamentally, one should say that a civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone. It should also be clear to everyone that people who are attracted to the armed forces and uniforms are more likely to be conservative, and that these people may have difficulty dealing with the lived reality. Of course, there are now many Germans with migrant backgrounds, women, and homosexuals (and by this I do not mean the overly stereotypical cliché of effeminate gays, because there are fewer or even none of these in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women about whom you would not notice if they did not tell you), and on these people I must rely, because in doubt, they will save your life or put it at risk for you. However, even these fringe groups, as strange as it may sound, represent a conservative stance in my experience, i.e., they are proud of Germany and feel marginalized by overly left-wing policies, even if these policies claim to speak for them or think they have to do something right for them. They simply want to be treated normally. Back to the right, of course, there are also extreme right-wingers in the police and military, but they are not allowed to openly express their views or even plot state-endangering plans in the media, which is completely exaggerated and also annoys me. Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, generalize due to negative experiences and also say controversial things that are politically incorrect. It also happens that right-wing-minded people meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas. Nevertheless, this is combated well in my opinion and countered with political education and enlightenment! Germany is so deeply involved in international affairs that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand what this is about. I have also ordered the other basket from the German side. Why would it come from England? When I ordered, it was not sold out. I ordered back in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It is still about my order that is no longer deliverable. I had previously chatted with #NAME#. Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket available in Germany somewhere else? I always only find you as a partner company.
However, at the edge of the wooden part, there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch.
Ordinary by child? Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a matter for some time now. I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but I have always struggled to keep my household clean and tidy in a sustainable way. There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and occasionally I get the urge to clean and tidy up. But it's never really "as if someone could drop by unexpectedly". My partner (unfortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly work and laziness win against household chores. The kitchen gets cleaned most regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with children? We don't have any yet, but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for some time. For me, I just don't have the motivation, it doesn't bother me so much as long as no one comes to visit and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable. Do people with children have a greater motivation to be more organized or do they remain sloppy? I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-shaping with special, deeper embossing at the joints for improved mobility (at arm and knee bends). The covered area by the Flex System 2 in the Focea Comfort 4 was more than doubled to further increase comfort. Smooth stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm, and knee bends). High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and at the buttocks ensures a tight-fitting, perfect seat. The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back zip and improves comfort, especially when bending and putting on and taking off equipment on the surface. The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility during arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high level of cold protection. Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body. Seamless, thin (-2 mm) coating on the face of the hood increases comfort, as well as the coating and durability (separate hood). Soft zone with a fine adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop fastener that does not adhere to the coating or seams. Double gussets with a zip at arm and foot joints connect an adjustable inner lining with a soft, padded neoprene outer lining. 45° inward curve at the end of the inner lining for increased elasticity and load capacity when putting on. Long zip with an Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood. Long G-Lock P back zip (overall without hood) with a metal slider and built-in Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent). Zippers at arms and legs with neoprene reinforcements at the ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels are fully bonded with outer and inner overlapping for greater load capacity. Edges of the outer and inner gussets are reinforced for increased durability. The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in place, especially at deeper diving depths (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted dive computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder? I have completed training in software development and have been working as a software developer for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now. The problem: I have an insecure (i.e., avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD). This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe this has improved). Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support. However, I don't know if the actual work routine is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find anything about it on the internet. The AVPD is already causing problems in my current job (for me, emotionally), as it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("I've messed up again with the simplest things") and it is hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"He must think I'm really underprivileged" etc.). The problems will probably occur in any profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment. What do they mean by "return please"?
When I download a book from #PRS\_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS\_ORG# does not authorize this book" appears. Is there a problem?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own body proteins from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather renewal in breeding birds are extremely complex processes and are closely connected to the overall organism of the animal with a particularly high strain. Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, as this can otherwise lead to disruptions in the breeding process. After this brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily. A crossed spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the start of feather renewal is visible. Then the normal dose is administered until the feather renewal is fully completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse the inconvenience, but the chair is sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in conflict with the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem. A walnut tree on our property is to be felled. A felling application has been submitted to the municipality. A staff member informs me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the bylaws. However, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaws. Can I now rely on the statement of the staff member or not? On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the bylaws are clear. I thank you for your answers.
As we understand it, then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message, well then I still have a sofa that has not been used. Could you offer me a discount or a voucher? What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that is possible. The only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the cover shipped to Germany. Can you check on that?
Notification: Serious traffic accident in Selb There has recently been a serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg. As the police press release currently reports (14:03), a car has come into the oncoming traffic while overtaking. There are injured.
Alright, I understand. Good, thank you again that it was so easy!
Rat and ideas for further career prospects Merry Christmas to you all! Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about. Before I now vent, briefly: I need advice, preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you. I am currently doing the Ref as a career changer. Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't want to be more specific here). The whole thing was too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could make me happier. At some point, I landed in teaching and was sure that was it - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me. I am now at my third "I google other job postings" and it has only been half a year. Before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which I could still switch. But right now, I am absolutely done. I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now there is vacation, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me. Before the Ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my celebration time was my celebration time. There, I was free. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now, even the family celebration is too much stress for me. And then there are those rigid structures that annoy me even more. Overall, it's fun and from an outside perspective, the Ref also runs well, as far as feedback is concerned. But I am completely exhausted and ask myself how much stress my body can withstand before it completely closes - if it doesn't do that already. I ask myself whether I want this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I shouldn't go back to the old area, where I was appreciated, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work a bit boring, it was appropriately paid and we worked together as a team, not as a lone fighter like most of the time now. But then I ask myself whether I won't be in the same situation a year from now and be unhappy. You notice, it's all a bit confusing, but maybe as outsiders you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely done with and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it, out. Making decisions emotionally right now probably won't lead to anything good. But maybe your perspectives can help me at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me. I hope my situation has become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, among other things, to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth. With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and adjust historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - but it doesn't lead to a win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placed and foldable Klettverschluss fasteners, it adapts perfectly to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens. A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and an external flash. Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for more lenses. You can also store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and non-photo items. Drone pilots also find the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: possibly the longest in history In just under three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island. So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data on earlier eruptions. Although the activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, volcanologists dare not make a prediction as to when it may end. The indicators point to a slowdown. "The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.  Damages in the millions In just under three months since the start of the eruptions, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2,900 residential buildings and other structures, as RTVE reported. Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava, equivalent to almost 1,700 soccer fields. More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at over 900 million euros. Off the coast, two new landings were formed by cooled lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares. The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants depend directly or indirectly, was particularly hard hit. 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, as the newspaper "El País" reported.
Christmas and the Gifts Christmas is standing at the door, and especially the children cannot wait to celebrate the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something tempting about them. Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold together our increasingly divided society. All the more important is it to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-promoting "social contract of primitive peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition. Strictly taken, Nikolaus became the Christ Child, and it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days so closely with giving. Before, gifts were given in some way on St. Nicholas' Day. The background of this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin. From this unconventional form of giving, the popular German custom of filling children's shoes with gifts emerged. Protestants objected to this custom because they reject the mediation between God and humans as "saint worship." For these reasons, they distance themselves from the institution. Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition. The focus of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. Since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only bothers a few that the custom of St. Nicholas, like the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period. Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in children's shoes and under the Christmas tree, as well as a variety of traditions in Christian countries. Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day. With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful mess over the question of who brings the children their gifts. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who, in principle, is a kind of Nikolaus with some assigned characteristics over time, such as his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the stricter Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Jesus Child. In Scandinavia, it is sometimes mythical creatures that bring the gifts, while in Russia, it is Father Frost who has gained some fame. Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika. In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is the Christ Child who is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been receiving this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact details are up to date. Please help me to resolve this issue, otherwise I will have to buy another e-book from #PRS\_ORG#.
Last week and this morning, I inquired about a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER. I was told that one would be sent to me. However, I have not received it yet (even in the spam folder), so I would like to inquire now about the usual duration of this process. Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace  In the vicinity of Kensington Palace in London, a man suspected of robbing a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon was shot and killed by police on Saturday. The police reported that callers had alerted them to a man armed with a weapon. The man reportedly fled the scene in a vehicle, which was later stopped by officers. Shots were fired, and the man was hit. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The police do not believe the incident was related to terrorism. Several embassies are located in the area around Kensington Palace, which is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also reside there.

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden. The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with two earth spikes. The integrated and powerful 0.4-watt solar module ensures optimal charging of the built-in battery. The maximum lighting duration is 10 hours. The robust plastic design is suitable for outdoor use all year round. In Hollywood productions, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that glow menacingly from the inside. In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun is enough to make this solar lamp shine fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The rounded, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern lighting object presents itself during the day. Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden. It also looks good among larger pebbles and boulders, where it asserts itself with its size. You can save yourself a lot of work: as a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" requires neither wiring nor batteries. Simply place the "Light Stone" in a sunny spot. If necessary, the two supplied earth spikes provide a secure hold. The matte white plastic cover is robust and weatherproof. The solar module discreetly conceals "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light. The battery charges when sunlight hits the housing. "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically as soon as it gets dark; in which color, that's up to you: there are six attractive light colors to choose from - in addition to daylight white. Finally, the lamp turns off automatically when the battery charge drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets bright again. As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts again the next day.
I have already done this several times, but it doesn't work.
Sorry, I would have liked to place another order with you, but if the coupon is not credited to my account, I will not order from you again for principle. If you decide otherwise, please let me know. Otherwise, this will be the last contact. Please also send me the number for the sideboard. During the lockdown, no hardware store was open anyway...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again. A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a very quiet operation, especially with bell armature motors - the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past. The load control can now be adjusted up to 10 CVs and adapted to difficult cases. The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic measurement of the decoder by the motor. The LokSound 5 decoder delivers up to 1.5A of motor current, enough even for older motors. - please use the eBay shopping cart so that the shipping costs are calculated correctly. - you will receive an email with the shipment tracking number. - you will receive an invoice with displayed VAT for each new purchase from the dealer. - we process your order or inquiry within 24 hours on weekdays.
Pill problem  Hello dear ladies, I hope I'm doing this right and that this is actually my first post after a year on Reddit. To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible period pains and premenstrual syndrome. Now I would like to stop taking it, because I already have to take enough medication for my chronic illnesses that I can't choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pains, but my skin. I had about 100 explosive pimples from 0 to 1 during my last approximately two-year break and they were everywhere. So far so superficial, but it bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel well. In the two years of the break, this never really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time. Parfum-free and without nonsense is my cosmetics already, but maybe someone can recommend something to me. The gynecologist didn't take me seriously about my skin and the dermatologist's appointment is still to come. Thank you to everyone who has read this novel! Yes, dear skin is such a thing. I had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread keratosis pilaris and the acne theme. I have also tried everything in terms of nutrition for my chronic illness and ended up on a sugar, milk, and meat-free mixed diet, because otherwise nothing really worked. It may also be good that hormonally the worm is simply inside, but when you, like me, have a construction site everywhere, you don't want to look for anything else that might be going wrong.
I had already written everything to their colleague, Semina or similar, and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my matter. I have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But it is generally available in large print because it is available in large black letters.

In the name of the people: Lay judges deliver judgments in everyday clothing in the courtroom. But their verdict depends on a lot, even if they don't wear a robe: jurors determine, together with professional judges, whether and for how long someone will go behind bars. Two of them report in conversation with the "public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznach District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately, I am unable to access my customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We cannot keep it for so long. We would use the table, as offered by them, as if it were ours.
Sure, I'd be happy to help you translate this document from German to English. Here's the translation:  "I had already ordered a blue one in November for the same chair, and I also received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now wanted to order one in gray."
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for collection and refund? And when would the collection be?
A new 10-kV underground cable will be built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding. The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision paves the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022. The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this. The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the transformer station in Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt overhead line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a mast for overhead lines near the Edermanning community in Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially with us so far. The blue betsellnummer:#PRS\_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me how the next step is now? Have a nice start to the week!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are bulging out, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged. The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come to my apartment due to #PRS\_ORG# regulations, which means that the commode cannot be collected because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Subject: Lesson Planning (EK)  Hello dear colleagues,  I have been in the Ref since the summer and I enjoy teaching, but I currently have major problems with time-efficiently planning my lessons in the subject of geography. Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I basically only have the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media to use. In addition, I can only black and white copy for free at school (which is annoying for geography). I currently need a lot of time to plan my lessons. For example, we are currently working on the topic of geographical factors, and at my school, each lesson basically stands alone. In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I always start my lesson planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We have the book Terra and I am not satisfied with most of the exercises in the book. That's why I also create worksheets. Maybe an earth science teacher can tell me how to work time-efficiently with the book. I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#. I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears the 2G rule for the Christmas business. In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered may enter. The trade considers this unnecessary and laments revenue losses. A possible solution has also been prepared. The 2G rules, in the view of the German Retail Association (HDE), are damaging the important Christmas business for the retail trade. For businesses with articles of non-daily need, revenue losses are to be regretted, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth. According to a current HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively. Many had already written off the Christmas business. "What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth. Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost around a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week. Only the food retail trade and the online sector are doing well. The association is calling for consequences from this dramatic development. Purchasing with a mask, maintaining distance, and adhering to hygiene concepts is a safe matter, said the CEO. "2G while shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations are deterring customers and requiring high personnel effort. The so-called wristband solution must be introduced nationwide, he demanded. According to this, each customer would only have to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all stores with the received wristband on that day. In addition, spot checks should be sufficient in the retail trade, as they already are in the public local transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested). The specialized real estate company Deutsche Euroshop, which focuses on shopping centers, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent. These figures will now fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner in the "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought for the centers and approved. This includes the so-called wristband solution, in which "visitors, for example, can present their 2G proof at a central location in the center once and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel, can enter all stores unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler. This looks unattractive. I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it. How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp. There are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K and save it. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is its easy and intuitive operation. The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light that is completely flicker-free. The 120-degree radiation angle allows you to illuminate large areas with relatively small distances. This is also excellent in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances. You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work with both on the film set or in the studio. The optional available DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach places. On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. There is also a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the scope of delivery) on the back of the lamp. The user memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To save the settings for individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons. The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures. One of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with inexpensive NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have enough power before the set - it is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display windows (the left battery in the upper display, the right battery in the lower display). In addition, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the lamp with power through the included power supply. The construction of the lamp is very simple. There is a 16mm threaded stud for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your photo stand. The tilt is reliably set using locking mechanisms on both sides. Great care has been taken to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and robustness. In addition, a tilt joint is included in the scope of delivery. It is also included in the scope of delivery a bag, so you can transport the lamp and all the accessories you may still want to buy without any problems.
Sorry, the gift I received is too small 🙁
"Party, die wir schmeißen wollten": Frankfurt feiert nach torreichem Comeback gegen Leverkusen Was für eine spektakuläre Reaktion von Eintracht Frankfurt. Nach 22 Minuten befanden sich die zuletzt zweimal in Serie sieglosen Hessen vermeintlich auf dem Weg zur nächsten Bundesliga-Pleite. Doch dann drehte die SGE auf, schoss sich innerhalb von einer guten Stunde den Frust über einen durchwachsenen Saisonstart von der Seele und siegte furios mit 5:2. "Es ist Wahnsinn, was die Jungs heute geleistet haben", jubelte Trainer Oliver Glasner bei DAZN und sprach ein "Pauschal-Lob, an jeden einzelnen, der mit dabei war", aus. Dabei sah es anfangs nach einem erneuten Dämpfer für die nun auf Rang neun nach wie vor hinter ihren Erwartungen stehenden Frankfurter aus. Patrik Schick hatte die Leverkusener mit 2:0 in Führung gebracht. Was dann geschah, beeindruckte auch den SGE-Trainer. "Wie die Spieler dann wieder zurückgekommen sind und eine fantastische Leistung gezeigt haben", so Glasner weiter. Ich bin wahnsinnig happy mit der Leistung, die wir gezeigt haben und natürlich auch mit dem Ergebnis. Auch Abwehrspieler Christopher Lenz, der erstmals seit dem vierten Spieltag und seiner überwundenen Muskelverletzung wieder auf dem Platz stehen konnte, betonte die Moral seiner Teamkollegen. "Ich glaube, unsere Mentalität ist unglaublich groß", sagte der 27-Jährige und freute sich mit einem Blick auf das Ergebnis insbesondere für die Zuschauer. Das war die Party, die wir heute schmeißen wollten. Für die kommenden Aufgaben will Glasner aber nun den Fokus bei sich behalten, sieht sich dafür aber auch hinsichtlich der Personal-Situation gut aufgestellt. Es ist außergewöhnlich, dass wir alle Spieler fit haben im Dezember, dass alle Spieler körperlich in einer Top-Verfassung sind. Es ist Top-Arbeit in unserer medizinischen Abteilung, aber auch die Spieler leben hochprofessionell. Nun wolle man "Schritt für Schritt weitergehen und bescheiden bleiben" und die Aufgaben bis zum Jahreswechsel "auf diesem Niveau durchziehen". Als nächstes steht schon am Mittwoch im Zuge der englischen Woche ein Auswärtsspiel bei Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 Uhr, Sky) auf dem Programm.
I received the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# to have it redirected, but there was no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is placed again? Unfortunately, this would mean that I will not be ordering again because it has already taken too long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Dampeners for the women's handball team before the quarterfinals against Spain: Germany's women's handball team sneak away with hanging heads and empty looks from the court after the humiliation against Denmark. At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB selection lost 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face host Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener. Against Spain, we have to act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished group III of the main round with 8:2 points as runners-up behind the Danes (10:0). It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game from everyone that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for advancement to the semifinals, a clear improvement must be made on Tuesday against the World Cup runner-up from 2019 to keep the fragile dream of the first medal since 2007 alive. Right-back Alina Grijseels was Germany's best scorer in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark with six goals. "We were just not there - neither in attack nor defense," admitted left-back Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward now." Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the level from the start. Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately in top form and prevented worse with a few saves. The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack. This was not, however, the hoped-for initial spark. Against the aggressive defense of the Danes, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team's goal. So the game was already over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, all the more so because left-back Mia Zschocke was sent off shortly afterwards for a hard foul on her opponent. She can participate in the quarterfinals, however. Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team improve somewhat and at least managed to get to within five goals by the break. The already faint hope of a comeback after the break was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19. Once again, the Groener protégés failed in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is one of the medal contenders at the finals. As a result, the German team could not catch up and left the court as clear losers.

The title exists, I am a vaccinator working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes. As these will soon be largely completed, it will then move on in part to vaccination centers for me. I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, provided they are not personally related (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does it interact with the vaccination..."). In my area of responsibility lies the education for vaccination, the indication for vaccination (person has a claim to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), medical documentation, and if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical technical assistants. In vaccination teams, we often do not have nurses present, but rather (thank goodness no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot perform vaccinations (are not allowed to?), so I also perform most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberg knows the solution  What exactly is a "Huidlerer"? With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, a heated debate was sparked on the Bavarian TV show "Wir in Bayern". But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unguessed in the "Host mi?" segment by the callers. No, it wasn't a "person who is nervous" or "someone who has to do everything quickly". The viewers heard from the TV moderator that these guesses were completely wrong. Upon which the man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus probably surprised many people from the Upper Palatinate. "The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a rag used to wipe the oven". Dialect researcher Anthony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this. With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the better-known dialect word "Houdern". Thus, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have not been able to buy any books for two weeks. After the confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later. I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# device, connected it to my computer, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of motivation to train a little in preparation for my upcoming bike tour next week. Said, done, and I rode with my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then, what lurks in every city (this time: thanks, Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Bang, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the route at all. Since I didn't have a real opportunity to buy a replacement tube and tire on a weekday, I had to turn around with a somewhat bad mood and take the first train back home. It wasn't technically so bad, maybe it's better if I practice tire changing again before the bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me. Since I have a rather long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not have this problem often. It wasn't really bad this time, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km by the time I picked up the bike on the day he was selling it) were already suboptimal and he had described them as such because he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about it, I have to change the tire again after 80-90km, then I'm really in a bad mood :D Now I'm talking to an older man at the platform, who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be puncture-proof. Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really that indestructible? I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I'm wondering: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike. There are apparently also these sizes (seemingly?) available with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are wider. Is this a problem? Or would you recommend other tires to me for a racing bike in general? The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD to me as a layman? Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!
Car slams into tree: Driver fatally injured  The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unknown reasons and crashed into a central island.

Hello everyone,  We are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year! Unfortunately, due to known reasons, we will only be able to have a maximum of four people in the studio, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of this announcement. BUT: At least three people will be joining us remotely, so we will be streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you joining us!  We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.  The show will start around 12:30 AM. Start getting your drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
