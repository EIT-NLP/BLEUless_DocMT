This is a certificate that I think is very meaningful - the First Aid Certificate. This is one of the important skill certificates, besides the driver's license, that I think is important! Spread the word: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken in case of sudden events, that is, emergency rescue before the ambulance arrives. As we all know, during the time it takes for the ambulance to arrive, there is still a certain period of time, and this is the most critical time. This is the time when we need emergency care. If I really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or sudden breathlessness, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes! Therefore, knowing first aid around us is so important! When someone nearby collapses, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly, feeling powerless, which is too scary.  "In China, we have official data of 300,000 accidental deaths each year, and the most dangerous one is cardiac arrest. In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved. In Las Vegas's casino hotels, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%. This is what the founder of the First Response said." If someone has a cardiac arrest, no breathing, and no heartbeat, performing CPR on them is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compression are the only ways to possibly save them. I found that nowadays, few people have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the time comes, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations. Who knows, we might be able to save someone's life! The First Aid Certificate can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered for it at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are also student discounts. PS: The last picture is a record of my goal to complete before turning 25. Adding the First Aid Certificate to my goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it! Now I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is a scuba diving first aid certificate. I think it's necessary to have a First Aid Certificate to take the scuba diving certificate, so the First Aid Certificate is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER# dishes, including a shrimp dumpling that costs 13 yuan!? How is it that #NAME# doesn't understand? One dish for 13 yuan? Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# forgot to deliver the food, so this time they'll give me just one shrimp dumpling to eat!?
Because earlier when I input the code, I saw that it was valid.

Chongqing Middle Vocational Schools Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System: Entering School Means Becoming a Preliminary Employee of Enterprise - Xinhua Net  Yesterday, a reporter from the Municipal Education Commission learned that from this year onwards, Chongqing will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship System" talent cultivation model in 60 middle vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will have dual identities as both students of middle vocational schools and preliminary employees of enterprises. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.  The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures of middle vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identities of students as both middle vocational school students and preliminary employees of enterprises be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual choice, a tripartite agreement will be signed between the apprentices, the schools, and the enterprises. For apprentices who are over 16 years old but have not yet reached 18 years old, a quadripartite agreement must be signed between the apprentices, their guardians, the schools, and the enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the apprentices' on-the-job training.  The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system model and jointly conduct enterprise employee pre-job training and transitional job training with collaborating enterprises. The pilot schools must reform the talent cultivation mode. The schools and enterprises should jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans. The pilot period of the talent cultivation plan is one school year, and the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. The on-the-job internship generally lasts for 6 months.  According to the arrangement, from August 2016 to August 2019, Chongqing has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot schools in three batches. The number of students in each pilot school is about 50, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. According to the principle of pilot first and then promotion, the pilot schools will be gradually expanded to cover the entire city, exploring the long-term mechanism of joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated education and training of students and enterprises, and effectively improving the on-the-job skills of students and the employment rate and quality of graduates.
My app shows as delivered, but I haven't received it yet.
I just ordered some takeout, but I don't know if it's been left at the door or if I need to request a re-delivery.
I live in Sheung Shui, so why would the delivery address be wrong for Hoi Fai Garden?
This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and finally, I decided to buy it. The suction power is not bad, and there is less dust at home. However, holding it with one hand feels a bit heavy, and the wet mop needs improvement as it leaves dust trails. Overall, I am still satisfied with it.  The electric cooker is quite heavy, but it is suitable for me, a beginner in the kitchen. My child said that the food I cooked tasted better than what they had before. I have made two dishes with meat and two with vegetables, and the sweet and sour pork was particularly delicious. The cooking time is short, and the noise level is low, so I don't have to worry about burning the food or not being able to cook it.  After receiving the product, I couldn't wait to cook three dishes for lunch. It is really amazing how technology has changed our lives. The temperature and seasoning control is precise, and the food tastes like it was cooked by a master chef. For those who are not good at cooking, this is a must-have item. I highly recommend purchasing it.  I have added a new member to my kitchen, an intelligent cooker that automatically controls the temperature and flips the food. I no longer have to worry about being scalded by hot oil or burning the food due to improper control of the heat. The food tastes better than what I can make, and the tomatoes in the fried eggs are particularly flavorful. This pot is a good buy.  Overall, the product is good, and the customer service is excellent. The screen is large and clear, and there are no other issues. It is thicker than the mainstream display and has a wider frame, but the display effect is still good. The accessories are complete, and the logistics are fast. The seller's service attitude is good! I have used it for a while, and the quality is good, and the screen resolution is clear. The frying is excellent, and the price is reasonable. The logistics are fast, and the product is good. I bought the second one, and it is indeed a good product. The display screen has high quality, and there are no problems with the interface. The color is restored well, and the quality is good.

South African doctors: Omicron spreads rapidly but causes mild symptoms  Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The head of the organization, Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are usually more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19. He said that compared to the previous Delta wave, the patients he treated were "short of breath, low blood oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the observations of doctors and early evidence provide some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases of South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe illness, half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while the death rate reached 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa. The director of the African Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease." He also said, "We are still in the early stages, and we need to obtain later data. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we entered this wave of the epidemic only two weeks ago." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods. Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 virus globally, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa as the epicenter of the epidemic. According to health officials, the number of new cases in Gauteng province of South Africa in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests show that more than 90% of Omicron variant cases.

Yang He Dong explained the core principles and practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's 6th Plenary Session from three aspects: ideal beliefs and missions, self-revolution and the great party of youth, and the leadership and theory of the party.

Because the delivery time is faster than the displayed 30 minutes, thank you.
Yes, I've changed drivers. He's been waiting for a long time. That restaurant has been saying they're processing it for hours.
The photo has been taken and uploaded to you.
I know, but the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
It turns out I didn't call #NUMBER# after all.
"不吃了 我一定会投诉 你送不到，怎么不早点讲啊 等你那么久" translates to "If you don't deliver, I will definitely complain. Why didn't you tell me earlier? I've been waiting for you for so long."
No, I did not receive the call. Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any longer.
A meal has been waiting for half an hour, but it has not been delivered. I want to cancel the order, why can't I?
Hello, the restaurant sent live chicken soup.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively affordable racket to practice with first. Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish between the two, it's normal for expensive rackets to be more friendly than cheap ones. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial garbage. They have low tension and when the ball hits the racket head, it vibrates a lot, and even a professional player would find it difficult to control. Their logic and hidden agenda are - tennis is so difficult, you won't be able to learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so we'll trick you with cheap ones. You'll play with them twice and never play again. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad. When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you've progressed, and then come back to buy an expensive one from me. I'll make twice the profit. I suggest spending a similar amount of money on a used racket that's a bit better, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are well-known enough, so good rackets can't be sold at high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 is already good, and a used one for 200 is a bargain, isn't it? It's friendly to beginners, but after the beginner stage, it's a pain. However, most people, especially women, can't get past the beginner stage.
Order has been repeatedly delayed in delivery time. May I ask for your assistance in following up on this matter? Delayed, thank you.
That is to say, I already have credit?
Do I need to place another order? Can I ignore the previous order?

In fact, there are many requirements for clothing matching for girls who are slightly plump. For girls who are plump in the lower body, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, which can cover the plumpness of the lower legs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs, and if it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and plump. If the clothing is divided into three sections of top, middle, and bottom, it will make you look taller naturally, as the top, skirt, and long socks use different colors, giving a sense of elongation. Many deep-colored clothes are the perfect match for plump girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and deep colors are also a good way to hide the plumpness of the body. Black short skirts are a favorite of plump girls. Wearing deep-colored clothes, especially black short skirts, can make people think you are thinner. If your legs are plump, your socks and shoes should not be too noticeable. The more popular the style, the better, and the color should not be too bright. Otherwise, when people notice your legs and feet, they may feel that you are plump. For slightly plump girls, it is necessary to learn some tricks of clothing matching. Plump girls should not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and tops should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If your legs are thick, you should wear black long socks or grid socks (the kind with fine grids), and choose soft-textured printed bell-shaped skirts, paired with a blouse with a lapel, which can cover up the shortcomings of plump girls quite well. Of course, plump girls also have requirements for clothing matching when wearing short skirts. Plump girls should choose tops that match the color of the short skirt, which can give the effect of increasing the height of the plump body. Matching a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the IN of the summer! If you are plump in the upper body but have thin legs, it is recommended to choose a fancy short dress. Not only can it cover up the belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A-line short skirts are more suitable for plump girls, and tops should be slightly fitted to create a sense of layering, which will make you look thinner. Simple white T-shirts paired with short skirts can also be tried by plump girls. Slightly plump girls can also have a sense of fashion. As long as they can master the rules of clothing matching, plump girls can also become the focus of everyone's attention. After changing in clothing matching, they should also exercise more in life and strive to break away from the label of plump girls as soon as possible. 😄

Why is there only one order of shrimp dumplings, but there are 6 copies of the order?
I can't go. I'm just a delivery person. In the past hour, no one has contacted me. This is just online fraud. You think I'm calling for outside delivery for the first time? After the investigation, you would say the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order. Thank you! How many days?
From 7:00 to now 9:30, it has not been delivered yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order. Okay.
The so-called new mountain district supercar exhaust sound is the loudest! This time, our team brings you a dream car for many men! It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4! With a price of around two million yuan, an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, and four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? According to the data, the acceleration from 0 to 100km/h only takes 2.9 seconds, which means that by the time the editor's Myvi reaches 30km/h, the other party has already reached 100km/h. The low body, aggressive scissor doors, large air intakes on all sides, and the 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini. For the description of the car model, you don't need to say too much, just Google it yourself, and the editor has prepared some explanations that may not be given by Google! It is too eye-catching, wherever it goes, people are watching and feeling uncomfortable (but it's actually quite cool)! The fuel consumption per kilometer is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all), and you need to practice getting in and out of the car to avoid embarrassment (otherwise, you may not be able to get out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud, and it may cause tinnitus after getting out of the car (but it's still very cool). The car is too big, and it will be very narrow when parked in a regular parking space, and it's afraid of being hit by the car next door when the door is opened! It's a bit lonely on the road because there is no opponent (the editor said so himself, and it has nothing to do with the owner, haha). Please don't misunderstand, this supercar video is not for sale, sorry! If you have friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars, please contact us! There are more car news that you don't know about in The Car Guide / People's Car Manual, involving millions of dollars in car accidents! The Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are probably familiar to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the hundreds of thousands! Recently, a few days ago, a Porsche 911 and a Chiron worth millions of dollars were crashed abroad in just a few minutes! Look at the result, it's worth the price!
I ordered a meal deal, but two items were delivered incorrectly.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网 新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。 牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。 该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。 许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。 赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。 美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。 赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。 他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。 目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。 亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。 此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yuejing Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu and the owner of the property, Mr. Lin, negotiated the details of the purchase and sale and Mr. Lu transferred 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lin's account as a deposit. Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the recipient and stipulated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week. However, due to disagreements on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale and payment methods, the contract was not signed. Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu a few days later. The factory that Mr. Lu had carefully chosen, the deposit had been paid, and the house money was ready, but the seller did not sign the contract, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yongjia County People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract in the end, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably inferred that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the liability of double compensation for breach of contract. After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.  [Lawyer's Reminder]: It is the duty to exercise necessary caution in the transaction process. When signing a contract, as the buyer, you should also exercise necessary caution, such as verifying the information of the property owner and whether the property is occupied by someone else, and clearly stipulating the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm afraid he might send the wrong address.

What is the way to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky? Everyone has different hobbies, some like to collect, some like to enjoy food, of course, there are also those who like to appreciate wine. Johnnie Walker Red Label is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirits Competition. Each bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, won't you waste its aroma? So, how do you drink Johnnie Walker Red Label? The editor will briefly introduce it for everyone.  The way to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label: Johnnie Walker Red Label is made by blending about 35 Scottish whiskies, with a strong and traditional flavor of Scottish whisky, and a fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. When you taste it, it is rich and refreshing, with a hint of vanilla and a strong smoky malt flavor. This whisky can be drunk directly over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.  Since Johnnie Walker Red Label entered China, it has been blended with soda, beer, or other carbonated drinks to become a timeless fashion trend. These sweet drinks not only neutralize the acidity, but they also bring visual pleasure, and when added to the drink, they have the effect of changing the taste of the whisky. The most authentic and traditional way to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label is to add a slice of lemon and sugar (sand can also be used). The traditional taste of Johnnie Walker Red Label is slightly sour, and adding sugar can neutralize its acidity, while the lemon will bring a refreshing fragrance to the whisky, of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.  The above three ways are the best ways to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label. Everyone can use them as a reference and try them out. Hopefully, the editor's introduction can help everyone.

Madam Jin's Wedding Dress Photography (Nanjie Store) does not currently have a branch. Due to our schedules not being arranged in advance, we changed the time twice before taking the photos. The consultant, Lanlan, was very patient in helping us arrange a time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos. The staff at Madam Jin's, whether it be the consultant, makeup artist, or photographer, were all excellent. It was my first time having a formal makeup done, wow~ I couldn't believe it, I will become that beautiful one day, hahaha. Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup, and the makeup looked very natural. The outdoor photos were taken in Jiangwan City, fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and we didn't feel too cold during the photoshoot. The makeup artist occasionally reminded us to pay attention to our clothing and accessories, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right. The photographer was also very humorous and made us feel happy all day during the photoshoot. When it came to selecting the photos, we saw many examples online and didn't want to delete too many photos for the customers, but when we were selecting the photos, we didn't feel the need to add any, we just chose the 24 included in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister who took her wedding dress photos with the same photographer spent over 7,000 yuan for a package that included over 1,000 photos, at the time I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos have been edited and Lanlan sent them to me, I saw two that I thought weren't very good, and they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos my sister took before with ours, I was really satisfied with our photos, simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xinhan Madam Jin's to take their wedding dress photos! The package price is 3999 yuan. Madam Jin thanks you for your sincere wishes and hopes that you will have a happy and prosperous life! How much is this package?
What conditions must be met for $32 to be used?

Your name is Zheng Ming, and this is your second week in Japan after moving here. You are walking on the street and suddenly notice someone following you. You become scared and start running faster. The person behind you calls out, "Miss! Please wait!" (Japanese dialogue throughout) You stop at the convenience store entrance. "Miss... I am a director. I think you look very beautiful, would you be interested in participating in a reality show with real people?" You are very suspicious and afraid that this might be a scam. He hands you a business card, and you discover that he is indeed a director from a major Japanese entertainment company. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The fee will definitely not be low." You hesitantly agree to go to the company with him. He says he saw you on the street and is very eager for you to participate. Thinking that there is no harm and you might even make some money, you sign the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts. In the first part, celebrities and ordinary people will live together to develop a rapport. In the second part, they will enter the game together to complete missions. The official recording will start next week, and you have no idea who your partner will be or what exciting things will happen.
So, is the system able to see new orders? How will the driver be handled?
I think I can't accept the order if it takes more than 20 minutes to be delivered.
Sabah's 320 newborn babies without birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (News from Kuching, December 11) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper being exposed to light, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people. However, the department's director, K. Arumugam, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be issued once the counterfeit-proof paper arrives next week. He explained at a press conference in response to a news report by an online media outlet that the issue has been going on for up to 10 months and that Sarawak is also facing the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces the counterfeit-proof paper was affected by the pandemic, resulting in a delay in its arrival in our country," he said. He explained that the counterfeit-proof paper used in Sabah's birth certificates is different from that used in other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' stocks. K. Arumugam revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit-proof paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on December 6 and was handed over to a printing company on December 8 for partial printing work. "The department will send personnel to Kuala Lumpur to collect the paper next Thursday (December 15) and will immediately proceed to the final printing stage in Sabah. It is estimated that it will take two working days (December 20) to deliver the certificates to applicants," he said, adding that the department will notify applicants to collect their birth certificates from local branches. He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates this year.

Download the Suning Finance app and follow the Suning Easy Buy service account. Super convenient, just like using a computer, solving the problem of insufficient hard drive space on my computer. The brand new solid-state mobile hard drive I just got today, the computer cannot read the mobile solid-state hard drive, and the computer does not recognize it, but it can be read by the computer using a U disk. The machine is very light and easy to use, with a majestic and beautiful appearance. I used it for an afternoon today, and the heat dissipation is very good. I basically don't feel hot, and the running speed is very fast. It can kill 99% of users in seconds after starting up. The battery is also very powerful. It can last for 9 hours on standby and 4 hours of use, which should not be a problem. Overall, I feel very happy that I can buy a machine of this quality at this price. I will supplement other functions later. The appearance is not bad. In terms of performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a while. The machine is fast, much larger than I imagined, and the rendering effect is very good. I like it, and I will continue to evaluate it after using it for a while. The seller in Hong Kong searched for the machine's serial number, and the quality should be OK. I feel that it is not too big, but it is a bit heavier than a 15.6-inch one. When running, it is very stable, and I don't feel any lag. I like the feeling of the fan dissipating heat, and it doesn't make a constant whirring sound like a gaming notebook. The screen is good, and the price is much cheaper than the official flagship store. They also sent a backpack, which I think is pretty good. The seller's service is also good. They reminded me to update the BIOS and promptly sent out the package. It's worth it! The heat dissipation effect is very good, and there is almost no heat. The weight is convenient for carrying, and the traditional ThinkPad design is satisfactory. The seller carefully checked the entire appearance of the machine, including all interfaces, without any signs of refurbishment or second-hand use. It is indeed a brand new American version machine with the same configuration and page as advertised. I forgot to ask for a backpack, and they immediately helped me send one. Although it is not the original factory backpack, the after-sales service is good enough to prove that they are a conscientious seller. If you need to buy a laptop, come back and buy again. The appearance is majestic, the display effect is good, the weight is moderate, and the keyboard typing is not bad. They also sent a mouse and a converter, which is very cost-effective compared to the domestic version. Overall, the machine is very cost-effective, and I will evaluate its performance after using it for a while. The screen is really comfortable! It is very smooth to use, and I will continue to evaluate it after using it for a while.

The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Believes China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period - Xinhua News Agency  The Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11  The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period.  Recently, the Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, in the Olympic Center in Sarajevo. During the meeting, Kvesic positively evaluated the relations between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina and expressed his belief that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period, as he had a deep impression of China's excellent organization work during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing the event. Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to use this as an opportunity to expand sports cooperation with China.  Ji Ping stated that China and Bosnia and Herzegovina have a special "Olympic bond". The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open, presenting a simple, safe, and splendid event to the world. It is hoped that the two countries will deepen their cooperation in the preparation of winter sports events and the training of athletes, and that the Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to play a bridge role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries and let the two peoples "move towards the future" together, and wish the Bosnian athletes good results in Beijing.  Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held a ceremony to award the "Best Athlete of the Year" for the tenth time, and Ji Ping, as a special guest, presented awards to the best young athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The promotional video of the Beijing Winter Olympics was repeatedly played on the scene.

The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism has issued a document requiring strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work in port cities to prevent and control the new crown pneumonia epidemic. It stipulates that persons who have recently left land ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) must hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and persons entering land ports of entry must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the port city scope by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) to March 15, 2022. In addition, the document proposes that conditionally, port cities may study the establishment of an epidemic prevention and control buffer zone within their jurisdiction.  A relevant responsible person of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a mainstay of the local economy, and there is frequent travel between the two sides of the border. By implementing differentiated management policies and turning a single line of epidemic prevention and control into two lines, it is hoped to achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.  Recently, there have been multiple domestic cluster outbreaks in China, all of which were imported through port cities. The above-mentioned document points out that this exposes some problems, such as the lack of timely epidemic monitoring and early warning, the non-implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the incomplete disinfection of cold-chain items at all links, the irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and the unscientific and insufficient emergency response to epidemic prevention and control.  The document requires strengthening the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and other nine aspects to fill the gaps in port city epidemic prevention and control. It emphasizes that port cities should coordinate epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihood, publicize and deploy epidemic prevention and control measures in a timely manner, and proactively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public. According to the document, the port cities mentioned include those with open land, water, and air ports, including the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities where they are located. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered municipality) according to epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the Bilibili platform sparked widespread attention. The film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan War under the pretext of "fighting terrorism" and forcibly exported American-style democracy. Over the past 20 years, the US military has become addicted to blood and violence, indiscriminately killing innocent civilians and committing various anti-human crimes. They have abused drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, distorted human nature, and formed killing squads. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians. They have set up "black prisons" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and physical humiliation. One atrocity after another has aroused more and more hatred among the Afghan people. As the video said, the US "anti-terrorism" war has become more and more terrifying. The war has not brought the Afghan people peace, democracy, and prosperity, but only left the country full of scars and countless killings and destructions. Let's watch the video together and expose the truth of the US's "fighting terrorism" and bloodthirsty killing under the guise of democracy!
The food delivery was late, and the food had cooled down. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it. Also, the soup had spilled out.
Cancel immediately! The things you sent are definitely cold by now, I haven't even taken them! #NAME# said you didn't have anyone go get them, we even called to check, and if you don't give a refund, I'll report it to the police.

Don't Frighten People at the Starting Line - China Daily  When browsing bookstores, one can often sense the popularity of success books. Many of the so-called "success books" today advocate the "best principle" - that is, first assuming or implying that you can "do it", then telling you what you need to do. In other words, it skips over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it". Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic: either they do it to the best of their ability, or they don't do it at all; either they score 100, or they score 0; either they climb Mount Tai, or they just stay put. This "best principle" may be recognized as "correct beyond doubt" by anyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.  The reason for this is that these theories advocate a path of "you must make a decisive decision, transform yourself, and make a 180-degree turn", which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who are conservative, follow the old ways, and resist change, you should especially shout in their ears "you must transform", which is undoubtedly self-deception and beating a dead horse.  Most people will be afraid to take the first step when faced with the word "transformation", hesitant to move forward, and find it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, with temporary impulsiveness, they may make a decision to "transform" and boldly take the first step, but it often doesn't last long, and they quickly fall behind, and it's hard to see any sustainability. Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue in his book "Starting from Tomorrow" perfectly illustrates this "universal human nature".  The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "despair and sigh". Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way that can allow more ordinary people to embark on a relatively successful path. The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it advocates a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do it perfectly, doing it to the best of your ability is also fine: 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing a small sand hill near your home is also fine, because that's still better than staying in the same place.  In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing. With the significant reduction in the threshold, there is a greater possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and the chance of success also increases. However, the path to success following the "second-best principle" may be slightly longer.  In summary, although the "best principle" appears to be advocating for the success of everyone, in reality, it can only effectively motivate a minority. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofeng, Zhang Hongxiang) According to the latest monitoring results, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons. This represents a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the protected initial period in 2002.  Qinghai Lake naked carp, also known as "Yangtze River fish", is a rare and valuable fish species found only in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human over-fishing and deterioration of the breeding environment, the population of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply declined. By 2002, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake had decreased to 25,920 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species".  Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries and rivers, prohibiting any unit, group, or individual from catching or selling naked carp and its products. At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, as well as the cleaning of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passageways", the province has continuously strengthened its conservation efforts. As a result, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased year by year.  So far, Qinghai Lake has implemented artificial breeding and release of naked carp for nearly 180 million individuals, contributing to a recovery rate of over 23% of the naked carp resources in the lake. The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan (Three Rivers Source) area is an important ecological barrier and water source nurturing area in China and even Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east. To protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai Province has successively issued bans on fishing in the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, even though the weather was cold.
Excuse me, is the takeout delivered in a bag? We only see one bag, and we want to know if it's a missed delivery or if someone has taken it, thank you.
It's been 1 hour already, and it still hasn't been delivered.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and it's disappointing to receive the wrong order. I need to order something else for the little kids to eat. I hope the restaurant can check the quality of the food even when they are busy.
Taking a foot bath and feeling a tingling sensation in your feet, is it because of electric leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can have good therapeutic and health effects on your feet. Today, the editor of Jingmei Xiao will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins have become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice. In terms of related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health-related household appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in an electrified water!" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath basin, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a flashlight and surprisingly found that the water in the foot bath basin was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied. Because he found that this popular foot bath basin, which has been around for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety. However, in general, foot bath basins are not prone to electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular foot bath basin. Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazards. At the same time, you can test it with a flashlight at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - China News Service 12/10/2022 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Shangwu, Hu Lanlan, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) On the morning of December 10th, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry. Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced: "The source of red tea is in Xinhua, and the rise of red tea injects new impetus into 'Five-color Tea in Hunan'." In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-dollar Hunan tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Hunan, Four Waters, Five-color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased its innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to launch, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving a significant increase in income for tea farmers and the overall increase in tea garden value. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xinhua warmly welcomed the "Red Tea Source". At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant was attracted by a high mountain tea named "Ice in Spring", and placed an order on the spot. Secretary-General of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with joy that various factors such as the epidemic have had an impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, the highlights are evident. The red tea of Xinhua adds a touch of color to tea culture, with popularity and lively transactions, and the Hunan tea industry ushers in a new spring.

I did not receive the order. Could you please check if the rider is still on the way? Hello, could you please contact the rider and ask if they are still on the way? I have not received the order and have not checked any food. No one has contacted me to cancel the order. I usually receive takeout, and the building management will call me to let me know when someone is coming. After they finish asking, they will let the person in. However, the management has not contacted me.

There is evidence from #PRS\_ORG# to prove that no one picked up the order. Despite this, #PRS\_ORG# wrongly accused me of picking it up myself. I reiterate that I only sent the order and it was completed by the other party. There was no one to pick up the delivery, yet #PRS\_ORG# wrongly accused me of taking it myself. I demand that you cancel the order immediately, otherwise I will report to the police.
Time Capsule Photography has not yet opened a branch. Member evaluation [effect]: I took two outfits. Overall, it's not bad. I like the photos very much. [service] Service details: Because I was pregnant, I felt a bit uncomfortable during makeup. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while. They also kept giving me hot water to drink. The total price was 1000 yuan. Thank you for the rabbit's evaluation. Originally, I said that ancient style was not suitable for ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful. Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can give us the energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend it to all guys! Whether it's reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography, or post-production, there is nothing to fault. The makeup artist is particularly skilled and can match a makeup style that suits you based on your style. The makeup products used are also top-notch brands. Teacher Tianlang is even more impressive. The photography is quite professional. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with. We work in Beijing, and the popular photography studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance. My colleagues have been photographed in Beijing, and after seeing the finished product, they thought it was just so-so. We specially searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expression management is not very good, but the photographer brother will capture it and record the natural and wonderful moments. The makeup artist, photographer, and post-production design team are all excellent. The finished product is praised by us and the people around us. I have recommended my girlfriends, and they are also very satisfied after seeing the negatives. I hope this kind of studio will not be buried and more people will discover it, so that they can take pictures that belong to their own style, instead of being the same as everyone else. Thank you very much for the five-star evaluations by Jinxing and Qingling, both of whom are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and as long as the customers like us, we will do our best to complete it. We are grateful to have met each other. Sweet and helpful assistants, as well as lively and cheerful photographer teachers, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful shooting experience, and it was an unforgettable experience. The finished product is much better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘 Thank you for the evaluation, Little Yoo. It's a fate to meet you. From Inner Mongolia to Qinhuangdao, your trust in us is a journey of thousands of miles. I'm happy to meet you. If there is a chance, I hope to come to Qinhuangdao to play again.
How to give money? The resent meal has been sent.
No driver received. Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programming newbie who wants to share their personal experience. If you are planning to enter this industry, you can consider finding a place to receive training, but if you don't have that idea, it's better to self-learn. After all, the money and time required for training are very expensive, and it takes 6 months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-learn, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the institution's faculty strength. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, the faculty strength of some new training institutions may not be very strong. Secondly, before choosing, it's best to investigate this training institution. It's best to investigate the students this institution has produced. After all, only the students of this institution know how this institution is and how good or bad the courses are. Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't made a certain introduction to your situation, and learning this thing and your personal situation have a very big relationship. For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city, all of these will be related to your learning or the industry you want to engage in. If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, in my personal opinion, if you have enough time, I suggest self-learning. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many online and offline training institutions are very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is quite large. You generally need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months. However, if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-learning is very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to Bilibili to find many training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consulting. In addition, there are some classic books that you can combine with videos for comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer major but can afford a certain learning fee and time cost, I suggest going to a training institution to learn. This way, you don't have to work too hard to learn, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, and there are people who can answer your questions. In addition, in terms of study planning or supervision, it is also helpful. Nowadays, many training institutions also sign employment contracts and have internal referral quotas. After learning, they can recommend you to go to companies, which can save you a lot of trouble in the job hunting process. Above are my views, I briefly introduced before because I don't know your situation, so it's not very detailed. If you have any other questions you want to consult on, feel free to contact me for communication and exchange.
I arrived at 1:00 PM and I saw it in the app.
What does "我还没说完，你干什么呢？" mean in English?
I, undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove tops, oil smoke machines, lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional sewing, home service. Thank you to those who silently give me a thumbs up. Life is hard, but we have to keep going. Life will not disappoint anyone who works hard. If you like it, just follow me. Thank you to those who silently give me a thumbs up. Life is like this, others only see the results, but we have to go through the process alone. The road can be turned back, but it can't go back to the past. Cleaning is both work and responsibility. Life becomes beautiful because of service, and service becomes exquisite because of heart. Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home until it is clean and tidy. When we see the satisfied smile and the raised thumb of the customer, all the hard work is worth it. My daily work - your requirements, my service. Serving with heart, cleaning with heart, leaving the beauty behind. We will take care of the details you care about, and "clean" will be done to the best of our ability. We serve with love. Keeping clean and tidy both indoors and outdoors is my daily work. A crystal lamp may be beautiful, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. Life is also like this. If you do things with care, you can succeed. With meticulousness, you can create exquisiteness. We are serious about it. Give me a chance, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything because professionalism is worthy of trust. Your recognition is what I encourage the most. Nowadays, all industries are not easy to do. But I always believe that as long as we have a serious attitude, perseverance, and hard work, we will be better than others, at least we will be stronger than those who just complain. One day's plan starts from the morning. All the beauty starts from the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction. Maintain a good mood all day long. In the morning, happiness is a thing. If you have it, you are happy. When you grow up, happiness becomes a goal. When you become an adult, you will find that happiness is a state of mind. Understanding it is happiness. Living a real and kind life, following your heart, and having no regrets in this life. Life is a journey, walking your own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, living happily until old age. At every stage of life, you will encounter different difficulties. Often, what binds you is not ability, but the courage to face challenges positively. Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more you will be trapped by difficulties. If you face difficulties head-on, problems will eventually be solved.
Chinese to English Translation:  Curators from China and Saudi Arabia join forces to hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale in Diriyah - Xinhua Net, Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Jun) The Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia, the first of its kind, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the biennale. The biennale was co-curated by the Diriyah Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center, Fei Yu, serving as the artistic director. According to the curatorial team, the theme of the biennale is "Touching Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and reflects the current state of Saudi society and culture. The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting works in six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted attention, with some artists using innovative ways to create works using recycled materials, such as Ice using discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in his "Behind the Story Series: Endless Mountains and Rivers" (2014). The CEO of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakri, hopes that this biennale can establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand the cultural and creative industry and the creative community in Saudi Arabia, and to enhance interaction. Fei Yu said, "The goal of the biennale is double, allowing Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, and artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered an axe and a cleaver. The restaurant told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver the bones. I want to ask for a clear reason. Can the bones be delivered? Just ask the restaurant to pack them separately for delivery.
However, the system is not very convenient, all using another room.
I am at #ADDRESS# in the Meilin branch, which is quite far away from there.

Yunnan: Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bi Feng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping poverty-stricken populations to find employment and to consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas and to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.  According to relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human and Social Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to place impoverished laborers and other disadvantaged rural groups in employment, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations to achieve employment income, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects.  This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Department of Human and Social Affairs, the Department of Rural Revitalization, the Department of Finance, and other five departments. It mainly standardizes the object scope of recruiting personnel for rural public welfare positions at the basic level, financial management, position development, position management, and other aspects.  In terms of position development, the regulation clearly stipulates that position development should be based on the principle of "needs-based, position-based, dynamic management, and overall quantity control", and the principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary public competition, and unified management".  The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of public announcement, application, review, public announcement, employment, pre-job training, and arrangement. In addition, the regulation also clearly stipulates the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare positions, and requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.
Wrong address Hello Can you cancel the order? I would like to place a new order. Has it been canceled?
II. Although the right wing has achieved its goals in a certain historical period, it did not last long. This is because giving a little sunshine makes it shine, and drinking a little water makes one sweat. As soon as one achieves their goals, they become attached to the right wing. However, in terms of seeking the truth, the right wing has played a positive role in China's social progress. From defining the truth standard after the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and technological advancement, to promoting the institutionalization of politics and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the right wing should not be denied.  III. As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I am interested in his views and respect him as a person. He is serious about China, serious about China's social issues, and takes them seriously. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic political situation. Then, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation.  IV. To improve or change China, we need patience and a sense of responsibility for the country. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to seize power opportunistically are not right-wingers, but scoundrels. Let's talk about the left now. The left is actually a group of abandoned children of their time and politics. If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when necessary. But the left does not have this kind of thinking, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!  V. Recently, I have seen some friends who are both anti-traitors and anti-leftists, and they are full of energy. I think it is not necessary. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists. They are all the same, without any reason. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make anti-traitors and leftists recognize it. Why should we? I tell my friends that when anti-traitors curse you for five mao, and when leftists curse you for being a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but when they grew up, they forgot their ideals or pursued them but became dogmatic. Ideals should be pursued step by step, and if one becomes obsessed with them, they may end up as a monster. Left and right, I think, generally refer to restraint and freedom. China's overall inclination towards the left is due to its innate cultural genes from its historical and cultural traditions. Domestic right-wingers value efficiency and development, while leftists emphasize supervision and fairness. Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to emphasize fairness, while China and the United States are in competition. The left inclination is certain to continue for many years. Although I don't understand it, a like is enough to finish the job. It's all about hypocrisy.
Not waiting any longer, placing an order in 2 hours at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches." What is normal public opinion? Let's randomly select three hot searches: "February 2nd Dragon Lifts Its Head," "Good-looking Friends Rise in Price," and "Cargo Transport Incident." Public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small "camel peak" that reappears. They look exactly like the "Evolution Model of Online Public Opinion" displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.  What is abnormal public opinion? Let's randomly select six hot searches from the same event, showing a "lonely peak," a "sawtooth," and a "cliff." A "lonely peak" is artificially heated and quickly rises to the hot search list, attracting widespread attention. A "sawtooth" is periodically heated, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search list. A "cliff" is a collective withdrawal, and the hot search has fulfilled its "function," waiting for a new task or heading to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of heat for one event is exactly the valley of another event, with only a few seconds difference, which must be the unified water army receiving a new task and launching a new round of attacks.  The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones provoke the situation, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgments, which ones incite emotions, and which ones influence decision-making. Black PR accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and the tactics are refined at the node level. They almost consider all the elements of the spread of public opinion.  Spreading is a science, and from the objective data, black PR will disappear without a trace. Leaving traces is inevitable, and we will dig out these traces together. The data source is the "Hot Search Time Machine."
Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency's correspondents abroad, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus for the first time. On December 10th, Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus. According to Mauritian Health Minister Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th after departing from South Africa, and the other is a local resident who came into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa and tested positive on November 30th. After being treated in hospital and undergoing nucleic acid testing, both infected individuals tested negative, and they have now returned to their respective homes. On December 10th, the Cypriot Health Department announced that Cyprus had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus. All three individuals are students who returned to Cyprus from abroad earlier this month. Since they have mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization, they have not been hospitalized. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Cypriot government has stepped up its epidemic prevention and control measures. From December 6th to January 10th next year, all passengers over the age of 12 who enter Cyprus by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense after arriving at the airport. The Cypriot Health Department also announced on December 10th that it would begin vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. On December 9th, Malawi's Health Minister Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda said that Malawi had confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus. The country's health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these three cases of infection.
The takeout has never been delivered, and the phone number of the courier is also fake.
I have re-ordered. Will the previous order be refunded?
If it can't be done, please cancel the order and refund.
Thinking of calling for breakfast early and eating early, but now it's 7 o'clock and I haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you're saying... is your Chinese a translation? Or do you prefer to use English?
Should I call him to send that?

Received from Money Stomach, the order is Phoenix Claw, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do I need to keep this in the conversation?
You told the staff on the phone.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
大美360集成家装地址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼  Initially, I was introduced by a friend because I trusted them, so I came to take a look. My initial budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. When I arrived at the store, they started a series of tricks. I was the first time coming to the store, and I only gave them my floor plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house, but they could give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly gave me a look at their materials, but I didn't know what brand they were. Their second trick was that you would have to pay the deposit as soon as you came to the store (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them). When I was hesitant about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you paid the deposit today, they would give you a certain amount of discount. This was a big trap, and I was cheated alive. At the time, I was impulsive and paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposit. The quotation they gave me had many problems. It didn't include water and electricity renovation, or any doors and cabinets, or the bathroom, which were all basic fees. In addition, their service charges were higher than those of other companies. I lost trust in this company. From the beginning, they didn't explain anything clearly and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they showed great experience and had a special team to deal with customers. They would shift the blame and avoid responsibility in various ways. They also had many details that I didn't want to go into. In short, don't choose this kind of company. My friend's house, which was decorated by them, was also of poor quality, and they charged various fees later. They are the original masters of cheating people, now changed to Big Mei, and seem to have gone bankrupt and changed to other names. So, don't choose this kind of decoration company. In the future, when choosing, please check on Baidu and consult these things because decoration is not cheap. If you want to ask a business, please log in or register. It is strictly forbidden to post various forms of comments on businesses. For detailed information, please see the merchant's declaration. The mass commenting channel provides you with the latest merchant information such as the address, phone number, and business hours of Big Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration. If you want to find a decoration company, just go to the mass commenting channel.
So terrifying, please cancel the order if it takes less than 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my refund within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it could be canceled within 15 minutes.
The Kung Pao chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it.
It's been 3 days without a response... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly subscription plan! What's even stranger is that I always use the same credit card for payment. I am now being charged for shipping every time. Can it be waived until you investigate and then collect my monthly fee? Is this okay?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's almost 3 am now, isn't it time for them to give me compensation? I told them to knock on the door for delivery, but the driver just left it at the door and then left. They made a mistake with the delivery.
Your driver has already picked up my takeout at #NUMBER#, but is still telling me to wait. The driver received my takeout at 19:25, but still refuses to leave. What should I do if I want to order more takeout? Should I wait for your driver to come back?
I am sending a package, if you don't cancel it, I will report it.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

Here's the translation of the document from Chinese to English:  "The coupon for the discount can be used now. There is no problem. You don't need to arrange for a resend. I have purchased it separately and don't want to waste it. Thank you for your help."
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insults, and I cannot accept such behavior of personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this kind of scoundrel. If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized behavior. From the time you started sending friend requests on Facebook and posting derogatory posts about me, to your attempt to publish what you call my home address and father's name on social media, I have already adopted a non-response attitude. After you, you became more and more brazen, not only continuously tagging me at the frequency of one meal a day, but also discussing ambiguous, insulting, and defamatory remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, upbringing, and whether to have sex or not. I... I've had enough. How could I later receive multiple friend notifications from Facebook, with photos of me and sexual harassment comments? As a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After I reported the news, you did not stop, but became more and more arrogant. I don't care what your political background is or what your identity and status are. In our society, both genders need to be respected. Yes, you can continue to use such provocative, ambiguous, insulting, and defamatory language. You can continue to claim that you only care about and pay attention to me. You can continue to deny that it's not your photo or continue to publish all attacking comments. I can't stop you. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your evaluation. I don't even think any woman would allow herself to be humiliated in this way for fame. When my friends asked me if I was okay, I said I was fine, but you wouldn't believe it. I don't think any woman who has been bullied like this would say she's okay. In the workplace, society, political arena, or business world, only those who lack basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice will prevail. I have screened some of the comments for everyone to see. You should not pretend to be me. I can only say that you are a barbarian.
I have reported and attached a photo, but have not received a response.
