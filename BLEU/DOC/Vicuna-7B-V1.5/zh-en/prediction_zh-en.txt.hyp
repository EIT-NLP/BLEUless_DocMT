Feels like a very meaningful certificate - the First Aid Certificate! This is one of the important skill certificates I think besides the driver's license! Let's popularize it: First Aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken in the event of an emergency before the arrival of the ambulance. As everyone knows, there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives, and this is the most critical period. This is the time when immediate first aid is needed. If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or stopped breathing, we only had a four-minute window of life, the golden four minutes! So, how important it is for people around us to know first aid! When someone collapses nearby, we can perform CPR on them using professional knowledge instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is so helpless and terrifying.  "In China, we have official data of 300,000 people dying in accidents annually. The most dangerous one is sudden cardiac arrest. In the United States, only 15% of people can be saved. In Las Vegas casino hotels, 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is below 1%. This is what the founder of the first response, Liu Le, said."  If a person has sudden cardiac arrest, breathing has stopped, and there is no pulse, performing CPR on them is completely useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save the person. I found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but it's too late when the situation arises. So, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make an immediate response in the event of an emergency. Who knows, we might even be able to save a life! The First Aid Certificate can be registered at the local Red Cross Society training center. I registered at the Red Cross Society training center in Zhuhai, and there are also discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of the goal I set for myself 25 years ago, and adding the First Aid Certificate to the goal list is something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it! Next, I plan to take other certificates I want to take, and I want to take the diving rescue certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving rescue certificate that requires the First Aid Certificate, so the First Aid Certificate is still quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER# of them, and one of them costs 13 yuan?! I haven't tried it yet, how could #NAME# not understand? One of them costs 13 yuan? Yesterday, #PRS_ORG# missed the delivery of the meal, so they gave me a shrimp dumpling to eat this time!?

The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission is piloting a modern apprenticeship system in 60 vocational schools starting from this year. Students who are accepted into the pilot schools will have the status of both apprentices and employees of the pilot enterprises. They will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees after they are admitted. The Education Commission requires that the admission and training programs of the vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices and employees of the pilot schools and enterprises be clarified. The three-party agreement between apprentices, their guardians, schools, and enterprises must be signed for apprentices who are under the age of 18. The agreement will determine the rights and obligations of each party and specify the specific positions, curriculum, benefits, and training content for the apprentices' on-the-job training. The pilot schools are encouraged to cooperate with enterprises to conduct pre-employment training and job transfers using the modern apprenticeship system. The pilot schools are required to reform their talent training models. The schools and enterprises should jointly design talent training plans, formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, position standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards, and implementation plans. The pilot period for talent training is one academic year, and the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, generally lasting six months. Enterprises should implement the team-based management mode in practice, and each teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that apprentices master the skills required for each training position. Starting from 2016 to 2019, Chongqing will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot schools in three batches, with each pilot school having about 50 students, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. The principle of "pilot first, then expand" will be followed, and the mechanism of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation will be explored to effectively improve the skills of students and increase their employment rate and job quality.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and finally made a decisive move. The suction effect is not bad, and there is obviously less dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy when held with one hand, and there are some dust marks when wet wiping. Overall, I am still very satisfied. The rice cooker is a bit heavy, but it is suitable for my small kitchen. My child says it tastes better than the dishes I cook myself. I have cooked two dishes of vegetables and meat, and the braised pork belly is particularly delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but other cooking times are very short. The noise is small, and there is no need to worry about burning or not cooking well. I received the product, and I could not wait to cook three meals at noon after receiving it. It is really amazing how technology changes life. The temperature and seasoning control is precise, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the level of a professional chef. It is a godsend for those who are not good at cooking. I highly recommend purchasing it! I have added a new member to my kitchen. It is a smart rice cooker that automatically controls the fire and flips the food. I no longer have to worry about being burned by hot oil or controlling the fire poorly and overcooking or smothering the food. The dishes I cooked turned out to be more delicious than those I made myself. The stir-fried tomatoes and eggs tasted particularly delicious, and the egg yolks had a great taste. This pot is worth the money. It is a good value and worth buying. The overall is very good, clear, and consistent with the description. It is worth having. The customer service is also very good. The screen is large, clear, and does not strain the eyes. I have not found any other abnormalities so far, and it is thicker and wider than the current mainstream display screen. However, the screen display effect is not bad, and the accessories are complete. The logistics speed is fast! The merchant's service attitude is good! After using it for a period of time, the quality is good, and the screen resolution is also very clear. The frying effect is great, and it is perfect with one split into four. The logistics is fast, the product is good, and the second purchase is definitely a good product. The display picture quality is high, and it is not because of the large screen that it becomes distorted. The interface is complete. Overall, I am very satisfied.

South African Doctor: Although the transmission power of the Omicron variant is strong, it is mainly composed of mild cases. Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, the South African Medical Association reported that among the more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province, the symptoms of the patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of influenza. The organization's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. He said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are usually more likely to develop severe illness from the novel coronavirus. He said that compared to the Delta wave, the patients he treated during the previous wave "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to a summary by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the recent hospitalized novel coronavirus patients, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in the recent cases, only 3% died, while the death rate in the early outbreaks in South Africa was 20%. African Health Research Institute Director Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said, "Almost all the signs currently indicate that this is a relatively mild disease." He also said, "We are still in the early stages, and we need to wait for later data. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Although the Delta variant is still the main variant of the novel coronavirus worldwide, cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa serving as the center of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases in KwaZulu-Natal province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and testing showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.

Yang Haoteng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the spirit of the 6th Hunan Provincial Party Congress at the video creative park in Mabanshan on December 10th. He deeply studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress.  Yang Haoteng expounded on the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China from the perspectives of ideals and beliefs, self-revolution, youth of the great party, and party leadership and theory. He emphasized the need to integrate the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress, study and implement them in an integrated and systematic manner, and enhance the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two safeguards." He stressed the need to unswervingly follow the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping and continue to advance in the right direction.  During the interactive exchange section, representatives of grassroots Party members, representatives of enterprises, and representatives of young people asked questions about the relationship between the three major decisions, the decisive significance of "two establishments," how cultural enterprises can seize the initiative, and how new-generation youth can draw strength from the century-long history of the Party. Yang Haoteng answered these questions with simple language and vivid examples, urging young Party members to draw strength from the century-long struggle of the Party and to tightly bind themselves to the Central Committee of the Party, unswervingly follow the Party, and use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations.

Actually, I don't know if it's a mistake from the store or from the delivery person. The bag doesn't have a receipt, so I can't trace it. I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time is faster than displayed by 30 minutes, it has been eliminated, thank you.
Yes, I have changed a driver. He has been waiting for a long time. The restaurant has been saying that they are processing it for several hours.
I have taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is constantly being delayed.
"原来要 #NUMBER# 那总之我不叫了" can be translated to "I didn't call it #NUMBER# originally."
"I'm not hungry anymore. I'm definitely going to complain. You didn't send it, how come it took you so long?"
"No, I haven't received the call. Please notify them and have them send it to our company."
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
"A meal has been waiting for half an hour #PRS\_ORG# has not been sent yet. I want to cancel the order. Why can't I cancel?"
Hello, the fried chicken sent from the restaurant is fresh.
I would like to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it. So I want to find a similar-priced beginner's racket first. It's not friendly, and in fact, the price often corresponds to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive rackets will seem friendlier than cheap ones, and these "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have low strength, and when you hit the ball against them, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control them. The logic and hidden agenda behind their existence is that tennis is so difficult that you know you can't learn it, and you also know that you don't want to spend a lot of money on it. So they make cheap, mediocre rackets that won't let you play for long, and then you won't play tennis anymore. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've improved, and then you can come back here and buy a more expensive racket. I suggest spending a similar amount of money on a used racket from a reputable brand like Prince or Tecnifibre. These brands don't have a lot of name recognition, so good rackets don't sell for a high price. A new one costs around 500-600 dollars, while a used one costs around 200 dollars. Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy the benefits of a thousand-dollar racket for only 200 dollars? It's friendly to beginners, but once you pass the beginner stage, it's no longer suitable. However, most people, especially women, can't pass the beginner stage.
Order has been delayed multiple times for delivery. May I ask for your help in following up? Delay, thank you.
Actually, what I mean is that I already have credit?
May I ask if I need to place a new order or should I just ignore the previous one?

According to a report from China's Xinhua News Agency, to strengthen the team of teachers in rural areas and ensure the balanced development of compulsory education, Jiangxi Province plans to train 1,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for rural primary schools within the next three years. Starting from 2016, the province will select and train one music, art, and physical education teacher for each rural primary school with a population of under 45 years old who have a basic knowledge or talent in these fields and can teach other subjects as well. The training will help them master the basic knowledge and skills of teaching music, art, and physical education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, learn modern teaching methods, improve their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of multi-talented music, art, and physical education teachers to alleviate the shortage of such teachers in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi Province also plans to train 300 teachers for music, art, and physical education in 100 counties (cities, districts) across the province, with a total of 1,000 trainees, to enhance their teaching demonstration leadership ability, teaching research activity organization ability, teaching ability, and network training workshop construction ability, and play the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.

Actually, there are many requirements for the clothing coordination of girls with body fat. Girls with fat bodies should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length difference should be around the knee, which can just cover the fat thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat thighs. If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling. If you wear clothes in different lengths from top to bottom, it will make you look taller, and the use of different colors in the top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt will create a sense of lengthening. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard outfits for fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are a good way to hide your body fat. High-class and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice for fat girls. Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you look thinner. If your calves are fat, your socks and shoes should not be too noticeable. The more popular the color, the less noticeable it should be. Otherwise, people will focus on your legs and feet when you wear them, which will give you a fat feeling. For girls who are slightly overweight, it is definitely necessary to understand the principles of clothing coordination. Fat girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the upper body should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If your calves are fat, you can wear black long-sleeved socks or net socks (the kind with small holes, please). Choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match it with a ruffled top, which can effectively hide the fat of overweight girls. Of course, fat girls also need to pay attention to clothing coordination when wearing short skirts. When wearing short skirts, you should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make your fat body look taller. Short skirts matched with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look more slender, which is the hottest match in summer! If you are overweight above your waist but have slim legs, I recommend choosing a beautifully designed body-hugging short skirt. Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A-line skirts can make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for overweight girls. The upper body should choose a tight-fitting one to create a layering effect, which will make you look even slimmer. A simple white T-shirt can be matched with an A-line skirt, and overweight girls can also try it. Overweight girls can also show a sense of fashion. As long as you master the principles of clothing coordination, overweight girls will also become the focus of everyone's attention. After changing the way you dress, you should also pay more attention to exercise in your daily life and try to get out of the label of overweight girls as soon as possible.

I bought it for my nephew. I planned to buy it during the 418 bank holiday, but he used it urgently, so I bought it early. I was a little disappointed that I didn't catch the bank holiday event, but the cost-performance ratio is high, and the logistics is fast. I will come back to write a review after using it for a while. It is a new original product with a high cost-performance ratio, suitable for playing games. The design style is not bad. I have already installed Windows 11 and Office 2019. The display effect: I bought it for my child to do 3D rendering, and the software is installed. My child said it can be used without problem. This computer can do 3D design work well. I bought it for my son, and he said it was good. The computer is good, especially the customer service attitude is good. If you don't understand, they will explain it to you. I recommend buying it. It is not bad, and the game picture quality is really good.
Is there only one shrimp dumpling in the order? Why do you have six copies of the menu?
I won't go. I'm just following the order. It's been an hour since no one has contacted me. This is definitely an online scam. Do you think I'm a first-time caller for takeout? After investigating, you'll find out that I'm right! Before I placed the order, I checked the address several times to make sure it was correct. Thank you! How many days is it?
From 7:00 AM to now, 9:30 AM, the order has not been sent yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Claimed to be the fastest supercar exhaust sound in Shenzhen! This time, our team brings you this car, which is many men's dream! It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4! With a price tag of almost two hundred thousand dollars and annual road tax of several thousand dollars, it is a four-wheel-drive car. Why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower. Can you imagine how fast it is? The data shows that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It's almost like myvi taking 30km/h to 100km/h, but Aventador LP700 does it in just 2.9 seconds! The low car body, aggressive scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen through the glass all perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style. As for the car model introduction, it's not necessary to say too much. Just Google it yourself, and I have summarized some explanations that may not be included in the search results! It's too eye-catching, and everyone is looking at it wherever it goes! (Actually, it's quite refreshing) 1km of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all), and you need to practice getting in and out of the car (because you might get stuck halfway out of the car). The engine sound is too loud, and you will suddenly become deaf after getting out of the car! (But it's still quite cool) The car body is too big, and parking in a regular parking space will be very narrow. It's afraid of being hit by neighboring cars when they open their doors! It's a bit lonely because there is no opponent on the road (I'm talking about myself, and it has nothing to do with the car owner, hahaha). Don't misunderstand, this supercar video does not intend to sell, sorry! If you want to shoot a video of your beloved car, please contact us! More car news that you don't know, just wait for The Car Guide / People's Car Chronicle, where car disasters with a value of millions of dollars are discussed! Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and Porsche 911's car price is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, several high-priced supercars, including Porsche 911 and Bugatti Chiron, were crashed in just a few minutes abroad! The result shows that it is reasonable to be expensive!

Yes, the order is in the accepted state, but the restaurant called and said that they cannot deliver the bones due to the driver not being able to transport them. Therefore, the restaurant needs to cut the meat and bones apart, and discard the bones. Can you understand my problem? It's not about order delays or can you directly call me to follow up?
The maximum length of a university student's leave of absence for entrepreneurship in Guangxi can reach up to 5 years, according to a recent report from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department. Starting from the next academic year, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, allowing students to extend their leave of absence for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years, and the time spent on entrepreneurship can be considered as practical education time. In order to enhance the innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities of university students, the Education, Human Resources and Social Security departments in Guangxi have jointly built entrepreneurship platforms, constructed more university-based practical teaching bases, science and technology parks, student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external support for university students' entrepreneurship. By 2020, the total area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in all universities in Guangxi should reach 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and 2,000 square meters for vocational schools. The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credit courses, and gives priority to students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to switch their majors. University teachers are required to spend at least two months on-the-job training in industries and enterprises every two years, in order to enhance their awareness and ability to teach innovation and entrepreneurship. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department requires all universities in the region to thoroughly implement the university student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, and strive to ensure that every university student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their studies. Universities are encouraged to actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

All-Visual Wedding Photography Base (Stall in Hebei) Currently, we don't have any branches. Wedding photography is a trendsetter, and makeup artists are also the first choice, with excellent shooting techniques and angles, it's called a professional. The service attitude of the sellers is also very good. The makeup is exquisite, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very happy, and the professional team made me feel very satisfied. I would like to recommend it to my friends. Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist for allowing me to have a unique wedding photo. Thank you to all the staff who took my wedding photo today, I look forward to seeing the final product. Shooting wedding photos is a physical activity, especially for photographers who run and jump. The makeup artist helped me design a suitable makeup for my face, and the photographer was humorous and lively when shooting, which deserves praise. Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist, I hope to see myself looking so beautiful in the future. I praise the bride, her eyes are beautiful, her appearance is graceful, and she looks like a virtuous and filial wife who takes care of her family in the future. The groom is lucky to have such a wife, and he will have a happy life with her. The quality of the wedding photo is really good, just like what is said online, my husband and I look handsome and beautiful in the photo, and we are very satisfied. The sellers' service attitude is also very enthusiastic. This trip not only allowed us to appreciate the beautiful scenery, but also took beautiful wedding photos and made new friends with the photographer. The wedding photo is so beautiful that it blew up the photographer and makeup artist, you guys are really super professional. I would like to thank Mu sister for her patience and meticulous guidance, and the photos she took are very satisfying to me. When I saw the wedding photo, I was so surprised that I didn't recognize myself at first. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have a wedding photo that is comparable to that of a celebrity. The most important thing in taking wedding photos is that the photographer and makeup artist have a good sense of aesthetics, and luckily, I met them. After seeing my wedding photo, I found that I was also "deceived."
A coalition of 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against the admission discrimination faced by three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - in their recruitment process. The coalition held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint. The coalition's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three U.S. universities has increased tenfold in the past decade, but their proportion in these universities has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called "holistic consideration" admission process, which is "long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian-American applicants." Zhao Yuxuan introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among the members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, while Harvard University and Brown University had been practicing de facto racial quotas for Asian-American students for over 20 years. Zhao Yuxuan told reporters from China News Service that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department would investigate and take measures to stop these three universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American students in their admission process. They also hoped that the universities would proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-American students. Currently, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Asian-American Education Union was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, the coalition also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Shaoxing Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province from an agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to buy the factory building. In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Liu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer. Ms. Lin signed the "Factory Building Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer, and both parties agreed to sign a factory building purchase and sale contract within a week. However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the sales range and payment method, the factory building purchase and sale contract was never signed. After several days, Ms. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Liu. It was difficult for Mr. Liu to find a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Liu filed a lawsuit against Ms. Lin in Yongjia City People's Court. The court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. The court ruled that the defendant did not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first instance ruling, the plaintiff filed an appeal. Recently, the second instance court maintained the original judgment. [Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary caution and attention obligations. When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary caution and attention obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and clearly stating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when the contract is performed.

Wenchang Restaurant (Wudaokou Store) [Mint] Environment: Medium-sized, orderly [Service Bell] Service: Quick service, "Ancient Malatang" is my must-try dish. The Malatang is too fragrant, soft, and delicious! If you like desserts, you must try "East River Soy Milk and Tofu Soup". The soup is very fresh, the tofu is very tender, and the ink... The taste is amazing! The meat dishes are also very good, and the service is enthusiastic. It's been a long time since I last came to Wenchang. The fruit I grabbed was still so good, and it's made of real ingredients. I tried the steamed bun for the first time, and it's the soft and crispy skin of the southern-style steamed bun that I love! The porridge is cooked to the right amount of dryness and wetness, and the portion is very generous. The signature Siyi Crispy Fried Chicken Wing is just as delicious as ever, and the example soup is also not bad. The processing of the bamboo shoots is also quite... The taste is amazing! The service is enthusiastic, the meat dishes are good, and it's been a long time since I last came to Wenchang. Wenchang Restaurant used to be a popular place on the internet a long time ago, located in a small courtyard with wooden floors. You always have to wait a long time to eat the porridge at the door, and the porridge pot is always cracked... It's been a few years since I last went to Wenchang, and the rise of various small shops selling Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow. It's rare to see a seat available when you arrive, and the quality of the menu is just as good as ever. The taste is amazing, the meat dishes are good, and the main dish is also very good. Wenchang Takeout. [Rice] Dining: This time's menu was a bit disappointing. Three cups of chicken: The side dishes are a bit too much, and the chicken meat is a bit too little. The main taste of this dish is a bit off, and the bottom taste is not salty enough, which makes the sweet taste more prominent. Everyone can think about adding some sweetness and various spices to the side dishes...
What is the drinking method of Red Label whisky? Everyone's taste is different, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, there are also people who like to drink. Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition. Each bottle of Red Label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't it be a waste of its fragrant aroma? Then how should Red Label whisky be drunk? The editor will introduce it to everyone simply.  Drinking method of Red Label whisky: Golden amber pours into the glass, with aromas of vanilla, caramel, and smoky peat moss. The taste is rich and smooth, with a hint of sweetness and a smoky aftertaste. This whisky can be enjoyed on its own or mixed with your favorite drink. When Red Label whisky was introduced to China, to suit the taste of Chinese people, Red Label whisky + Coca-Cola, Sprite, or New Coke became a fashionable drink that lasts forever. These sweet drinks not only neutralize the acidity, but also visually bring happiness to people, adding the drink, it can change the taste of the mouth.  Red Label whisky + lemon slice + sugar (sand sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink. The taste of the genuine Red Label whisky is slightly sour, and adding sugar can neutralize its sour taste. Lemon will give the whisky a refreshing aroma, of course, the sweet-sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste. The above three are the best ways to drink Red Label whisky, and everyone can try them as references, hoping that the editor's introduction can help everyone.
If it is not possible for me to change the store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?

Translation:  Golden Flower Man Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have a branch. Before the photo shoot, because we didn't arrange the time properly, we had to change the time twice. The consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a sunny weekend day for the photo shoot. The staff of Golden Flower Man were all amazing, whether they were consultants, makeup artists, or photographers. It was my first time having professional makeup done, and I was amazed. I couldn't believe that I would look that good one day. The makeup artist, Jiajia, and my other sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did an amazing job with the makeup, and it looked very natural. The photo shoot was held in Hangzhou City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so we didn't feel too cold. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothing and accessories from time to time, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel very happy during the photo shoot. When we were choosing the photos, we didn't want to take too many photos online because we saw a lot of examples, but when we were choosing the photos, we didn't add any extra ones (I heard that my cousin, who took her wedding photos, added over a thousand extra photos to her seven-thousand-yuan package, and I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many). The photos were edited today, and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they weren't that good, so they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who took our photos before with our photos, I was very satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I really recommend everyone to go to Hangzhou Golden Flower Man for their wedding photos! Package price: 3,999 yuan. Golden Flower Man thanks you for your sincere wishes and hopes that you will be happy and prosperous! How much is this package?
What conditions must be met for the $32 to be used?
Alright, no need to return the money.
Your co-pilot can't find it, can't find it, but I still don't understand what he's saying in English.
"Do you want me to return the chili sauce base to you?"

You're called Zhang Mi, and this is your second week in Japan. You're walking on the street when suddenly someone follows you. You're scared and start running, but the person calls out to you, "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese conversation) You stop at the entrance of a convenience store. "Miss... I'm a director. I think you look very beautiful and I'm interested in casting you for a reality show?" You're very suspicious and afraid it's a scam. He gives you his business card, and you find out he's a director from a major Japanese entertainment company. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company and talk. The salary will definitely be high." You hesitantly agree and come to the company with him. He says he saw you on the street and is very eager for you to participate. You think about it and decide it's a good opportunity to earn money, so you sign the contract. This is a large-scale reality show about love, divided into two parts. In the first part, celebrities and ordinary people will live together and develop chemistry. In the second part, they will enter a game together to compete. The recording will officially start next week, and you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen?
So, can the system see the new order? How will it handle the rider?
I think I can't accept orders that take more than 20 minutes to arrive.
In Sabah, 3,200 newborn babies have yet to receive their birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates for newborn babies because the stock of anti-forgery paper has been used up. As a result, the number of affected individuals has reached 3,200. However, the department's director, Kharudin Amins, assured that all applications for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and that the certificates will be issued as soon as the anti-forgery paper arrives next week. He explained that the issue has been ongoing for more than 10 months, and that Sarawak is also facing the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces the anti-forgery paper has been affected by the pandemic, causing a delay in the delivery of the paper to Malaysia," he said. Amins added that the anti-forgery paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, and cannot be borrowed from other states. He revealed that the latest batch of anti-forgery paper has already arrived in Kuala Lumpur on December 6, and will be given to the printing company on December 8 for partial printing work. "The National Registration Department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the paper, and it is estimated that the birth certificates will be ready for distribution within two to three working days (by December 20)," he said. Amins said that the department will notify applicants to collect their birth certificates from the respective district offices. He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From 7:00 PM onwards, isn't it almost time now? I'm referring to food.
I am currently facing #PRS\_ORG# on the opposite side.
Hello, thank you, the restaurant says it has prepared everything.
Thank you for reordering with accumulated points.  Translation: 非常感谢您使用积分重新下单。

Download the Suning Finance App and follow Suning's WeChat official account to save money and make money. Download the Suning Financial App and follow the Suning Easy Shopping WeChat official account for ultimate convenience. It's even more super convenient than using a computer, solving the problem of insufficient hard drive space on my computer. Today's brand-new 2.5-inch solid-state drive is not recognized by my computer, but it can be read by a USB drive. The machine is light and handy, with a stylish appearance. I used it for a few hours today, and it dissipates heat very well. I basically didn't feel any heat, and the running speed is very fast, with 99% of users opening the machine in under a second. The battery is also very powerful, lasting for 9 hours after being fully charged, and it should be fine to use for 4 hours. Overall, this price can buy a machine with such quality, and I feel very happy. I will discover other functions later and add them later. The appearance is not bad. In terms of performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a period of time. The machine is fast, much faster than I imagined, with excellent rendering effect, and I like it very much. I will wait for a while before giving a detailed evaluation. It's great, and the serial number I checked in Hong Kong appears to be of good quality. The machine feels a bit heavy, but it's only slightly heavier than a 15.6-inch laptop, and it runs very stably. I didn't feel any lag, and the fan sound of heat dissipation is very pleasant. It's also great that it doesn't keep turning things on and off like a game console. The price is much cheaper than official flagship stores, and it even comes with a backpack. I think it's great. The service of the store is also very good, reminding me to update the BIOS and promptly offering a replacement. It's worth it! The heat dissipation effect is very good, with basically no heat. The portability level is very convenient, and the appearance material is the traditional Thinkpad design, which satisfies me. The seller is trustworthy, and I carefully checked the entire machine exterior, all interfaces, and there were no signs of refurbishment or use. It is indeed a brand-new and beautiful machine, with the same configuration as the page. I forgot to send the backpack, but the seller immediately sent a backpack to me, although it was not the original factory backpack, but the after-sales service was good enough to prove that it was a conscientious seller. If you need to buy a notebook, please recommend it to your friends. The appearance material is stylish, and the display effect is clear and sharp. The portability level is relatively heavy, but the feeling of holding a heavier thing is better. The heat dissipation effect will be evaluated later. The keyboard typing feels very good, and a mouse and a transformer are also included in the configuration, which is more cost-effective than domestic brands. Overall, the price is reasonable, and the machine's performance should be evaluated after using it for a period of time. This screen is really comfortable! The use is very smooth, and I will wait for a while before giving a detailed evaluation.

The promotional videos of the Beijing Winter Olympics were played on a loop at the event.

The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control measures in border cities within 48 hours of obtaining a negative nucleic acid test result. Those traveling to border cities from outside the country must take a nucleic acid test within 48 hours of departure and undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government to March 15, 2022. In addition, border cities with conditions can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control. The National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office said that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides travel frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies will turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of controlling the spread of the epidemic by closing the border and reducing the risk of epidemic spillover, with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost. Recently, several domestic cluster outbreaks have occurred, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice pointed out that some places have problems with the timely monitoring and warning of epidemics, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions, the formalism of regular nucleic acid testing, the insufficient disinfection of cold-chain products, the unstandardized management of centralized isolation facilities, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic control. The notice requires efforts to be made from nine aspects, including improving the mechanism for border city epidemic prevention and control, strengthening the monitoring and early warning system for epidemics, implementing border control measures, and publishing and promoting the hotline for ensuring people's livelihood security. Border cities are required to study epidemic prevention and control in parallel with ensuring people's livelihood security, publish and promote the hotline for ensuring people's livelihood security, regularly check the emergence of problems such as the supply and price of basic necessities, and proactively respond to prominent issues raised by the public. The scope of the border cities mentioned in the notice includes the counties (cities, districts, and banners) where land, water, and air border ports are located, as well as the prefecture-level cities, municipalities, and autonomous regions where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, and directly-administered municipality) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipeline video reveals the truth behind 20 years of US bloodthirsty killing spree in Afghanistan - Xinhua Net (Video source: Oil Pipeline)  On December 11, a video titled "Killing Machine" was posted on the Oil Pipeline platform, attracting widespread attention. The video tells the story of how the US, using the pretext of "anti-terrorism," launched a war in Afghanistan to forcibly export American-style democracy, committing 20 years of barbarous, bloodthirsty, and sadistic crimes, including the murder of innocent civilians.  Using drone strikes to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, the US has twisted human nature and established a killing squad. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians. The US has set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation. The more atrocities committed against humanity, the more Afghans' hatred towards the US grows.  As the video says, the "War on Terror" waged by the US "is becoming more and more terrifying." The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only left the country with a nation riddled with scars and countless acts of destruction.  Watch the video and let's expose together the truth behind the 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree carried out by the US under the guise of "anti-terrorism," as well as the hypocrisy and false face of American-style democracy!
The food delivery was late, and when it arrived, it was cold. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard to eat. It was completely inedible and the soup spilled out.
Immediately cancel, the things sent by #PRS\_ORG# must have cooled down, I haven't taken them yet! #NAME# says no one has gone to take them. We have already called and if you don't refund, I will report to the police.
Multiple times using #PRS\_ORG#, today's experience is the worst. It is completely unacceptable. Although it is good, it is also necessary to remind the restaurant and the driver to avoid such situations from happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time. The time keeps delaying and I don't know when to wait. If I cancel the order, can I get a refund for the payment?

Don't push people over the starting line - Xinhua Net When you browse books in a bookstore, you often feel the popularity of success-oriented books. Today's successful books often claim to be "the best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental "how to do it" phase. As a result, these books all have a common characteristic - either they do everything to the best of their ability or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100 or they are 0; either they climb to the top of the mountain or they stay put where they are. This "best principle" is so convincing that everyone will admit that it is "absolutely correct," but 99% of people will be pushed over the starting line before they even begin. Because this theory encourages a path that says, "You must make up your mind, change your personality, and make a 180-degree turn," which is the fatal weakness of many people. For those who insist on following the rules, adhering to the old ways, and rejecting change, it is self-deception to tell them to "change" when they are deaf to it. Most people will be intimidated by the word "change" and hesitate to take the first step. They either can't make up their minds or, relying on a momentary impulse, make a rash decision to "change" and then bravely take the first step, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain their determination. The famous song "From Tomorrow" by Mr. Ma Sanliang is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, making them "gasp in admiration" when they see it. Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to take a path to relative success. The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory that says, "small victories lead to great victories." That is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb the mountain, just climb the small hill in front of your house, because it's better than standing still. In summary, as long as you do something, it's stronger than not doing anything. Since the threshold is lowered, it increases the possibility of ordinary people persisting in their efforts, and as long as they persist, the success probability increases. However, following the path of the "second-best principle" requires a slightly longer journey. In summary, although the "best principle" flies the flag of making everyone successful on the surface, it ultimately only inspires a small number of people; while the "second-best principle" can effectively inspire more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.

According to the latest monitoring results, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection period in 2002, it has increased by more than 40 times. Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Mi'er" in local dialect, is a precious fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Qinghai Lake carp population was severely reduced due to large-scale fishing, habitat degradation, and other factors. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2,592 tons. In 2004, it was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species. Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its tributary rivers, prohibiting any units, groups, or individuals from fishing, selling, or processing Qinghai Lake carp and its products. Simultaneously, through artificial breeding and releasing, habitat cleanup, and the design of scientific and reasonable "passageways" for fish migration, the protection measures have been continuously strengthened, resulting in an annual increase in the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp. Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau deputy director Yang Lin introduced that, as of now, nearly 1.8 billion carp fry have been artificially bred and released for the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources, with a contribution rate of over 23%. Qinghai Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area for China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the Gobi Desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the Qinghai Lake watershed, maintain biological diversity in the Qing-Zang Plateau, and prevent the expansion of the Gobi Desert to the east, Qinghai Province has recently issued notices on the comprehensive ban of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Qinghai Lakes, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system covering "one river, one lake, one reservoir".

Restaurant only gave me a bag to put the food in, and it's cold outside.
May I ask, is the food packed in a bag? We only see one bag. I wonder if it's a missing item or if someone has taken it. Thank you.
It has been 1 hour already, but I haven't sent it yet.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and the delivery is quite disappointing. I suggest ordering separately for the children to eat. I hope the store can check the quality of the products in the midst of their busy schedule.
Is the foot bath tank leaking electricity? Can the right foot bath tank bring health benefits? Today, the editors of Country美小编 will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath tanks are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tanks and other health-related household appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tanks, so there are certain safety risks. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath tank as a gift for his father's birthday, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them. At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath tank, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath tank was electric. Later, he contacted the store, and although the store was willing to refund the foot bath tank, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular foot bath tank, which has been around for a long time, lacks clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees. However, in general, foot bath tanks do not have electricity problems, but there is a small number of products that may not have been strictly inspected during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath tank. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. At the same time, you can take a pen to test.
The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo opened today at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of becoming a billion-dollar tea industry. The vice chairman of the National Wholesale and Retail Industry Alliance, Hunan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee Vice Chairman Ye Hong, and the academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Liu Zhonghua, attended the opening ceremony. The experts in Hunan's tea industry said that after harvesting green tea and red tea, tea farmers can have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens will continue to rise. At the opening ceremony, Hunan's provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. In the Hunan Red Tea Exhibition Hall, Fujian tea merchants were impressed by a high-mountain tea named "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhen, said that the current epidemic and other factors may have an impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the tea expo, the highlights were eye-catching. The Hunan Red Tea is red in color and has injected the cultural connotation of tea into it, making it popular and lively, and the Hunan tea industry is looking forward to a new spring.

There is #PRS\_ORG# as a witness, and we have done our best to prevent anyone from taking it. #PRS\_ORG# falsely accused me of taking it, but I would like to reiterate that I only sent the order, and no one from your family has taken it. Then #PRS\_ORG# falsely accused me of taking it again, and I demand that you cancel it immediately, otherwise I will report the police.
Time-lapse photography is still not available in stores, but there are member reviews. The effect of the photo: I took two sets of clothes, and overall, it's not bad. I really like this set of photos. The service details: Because I was pregnant and doing makeup, it was a bit uncomfortable. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest in the corner while constantly giving me hot water. The package price: 1000 yuan. Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally, I was going to refuse the ancient style, but the final product was so beautiful that I didn't expect it. Thank you for the recognition of Dan Dan. Your satisfaction makes us full of energy to continue forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all little friends to come! From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no compromise. The makeup artist is particularly delicate, and she will match your style to create a suitable makeup for you. The makeup products used are all first-line brands. Teacher Yang is even more professional in photography. The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little cats playing around. We work in Beijing and need to line up half a year in advance for good studios. My colleagues who have taken photos in Beijing said they were just so-so. I specially searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude. We are not good at managing our facial expressions, which is a common problem for most people. The photographer, Mr. Yang, will take pictures and record the natural beauty of the moment. The makeup artist, photographer, and post-production designer are a luxurious team. When the film comes out, we and the people around us all praise it. I have already recommended it to my friends, and my friends who saw the film were also very satisfied. I hope more people can discover such studios, take photos in their own style, and not just follow the same formula. Thank you very much for the five-star review from Hao Xiong and Xing Liang. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the job if the customer likes it. Thank you for the sweet and thoughtful assistant and the lively and open-minded photographer teacher. Everyone in the team is super nice. It was a beautiful shooting experience, and it was hard to forget. The effect of the shooting was much better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘 Thank you for the review from Xiao Yu. Getting to know you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to get to know you, and I look forward to seeing you again in Qinhuangdao next time.
How can I pay for it? The meal that was sent again has already been delivered.
There is no waiter available. The restaurant staff is currently giving me a phone call.
A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training institution to learn, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and it takes six months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are weak in self-study. If you have a relatively strong self-study ability, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. Firstly, you need to see the strength of the institution's teachers. If the teacher strength is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have teacher strength that is not particularly strong. Secondly, before choosing a training institution, you should investigate the students of this institution, because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the teaching is. You know, I actually don't know how to answer your question because I don't have any introduction to your situation. Learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship. For example, your professional, age, desired language, even in which city, all of these will have a relationship with your learning or the industry you want to engage in. If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest that you self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is relatively large, basically need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months. But if you self-study, it is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the network, or you can also find many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos to learn. If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain cost and time for learning, then I suggest going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much money, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. There are also people who specialize in answering questions. Moreover, many training institutions now have employment agreements, and they have internal recommendations and can help you find a job after you graduate. This way, you can save a lot of trouble in the interview process when looking for a job after graduation. These are some of my opinions. I didn't introduce them in detail because I didn't know your situation. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and communication.
I said 1 point earlier, I saw it in the App as well.
What's called "我还没说完，你干什么呢？" in Chinese translates to "What's called '我还没说完，你干什么呢？' in Chinese?" in English.
Thank you for entrusting me with various tasks such as installation, cleaning, maintenance, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil boilers, lighting fixtures, professional sewing, housekeeping services, and more. I appreciate those who silently give me thumbs up. Life can be tough, but we must continue to persevere. Life will not disappoint those who work hard. If you like my work, please pay attention to me. I appreciate those who silently give me thumbs up. Life is like this, others only see the result, but I work hard alone and face life. We are not only strong, but also persistent. We have no choice but to move forward. The road may be backward, but we cannot go back. Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful through service, and service comes from the heart. We may do the dirtiest job, but we will use the most sincere attitude to thoroughly clean every corner of the customer's house. Seeing the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised thumb, all the fatigue is worth it. My daily work is your requirements, and my service is my dedication. With heartfelt service and cleaning, we can leave behind beauty. The details you care about are what I can do for you, and I am committed to serving my family. We strive to make every house clean and tidy, carve out a reputation for our housekeeping services, provide excellent service, and make every house clean and tidy. We offer indoor and outdoor cleaning services, and my daily work is your requirements. Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it will become dull and lifeless if it is not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can it shine with its full glory. Life is like this too. We can only succeed if we use our hearts and pay attention to the details. We are sincere in our work. We believe that every detail counts, and we strive to create a refined and exquisite work. We are committed to our work. Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because we are trustworthy. In today's society, everyone is busy, but I believe that as long as we have a serious attitude, perseverance, and hard work, we will be better than others, and at least we won't be complaining. One day's plan begins with the morning. All the beauty starts from the morning. I hope you can start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything going well. Maintain a good mood all day long. When we were young, happiness was a thing, and having it made us happy; when we grew up, happiness became a goal, and achieving it made us happy; and when we became mature, we found that happiness was a state of mind, and understanding it made us happy. Do your best to be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, and live your life without regrets. Life is one road, and we must walk our own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, and we can shine until we are old. At each stage of life, we will encounter different challenges. Sometimes, what binds us is not our ability, but our courage to face it. Since we cannot avoid it, we might as well face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be knocked down by difficulties; but if you face them bravely, problems will eventually be solved.
The first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia was held in the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of the capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other regions participated in the exhibition. The exhibition was co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. UCCA Center for Contemporary Art Director Tian Weituo served as the art director of the exhibition. According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching the Stone and Crossing the River," which reflects the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation and the current situation of cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is composed of six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching the Stone and Crossing the River," "Tradition as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounts for more than four-fifths of the total number of works, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, etc. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also well-received, some of whom use recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's "The Story Behind the Mountains Is Endless" series (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting with discarded objects. Diriyah Biennial Foundation Chairman Bakkali said he hoped that this biennial exhibition could establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia and strengthen exchanges and interactions. Tian Weituo said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, allowing Saudi Arabian contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and allowing Saudi Arabian audiences to enter the world of contemporary art." It is reported that during the opening week of the exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and opinion leaders in the fields of art, curators, and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered some chopsticks from a restaurant, and they told me that the delivery person cannot send bones. I wanted to clarify the reason, as bones can be included. I asked the restaurant to pack them separately for delivery.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the orderly management of public welfare positions in rural areas, consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, and assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that at present, a total of 44.83 million public welfare positions have been developed in Yunnan, which are used to provide employment for impoverished labor forces and other difficult groups in rural areas, and have played an important role in helping impoverished populations achieve employment growth, consolidate poverty alleviation results, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas.  This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the Rural Revitalization Office, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, the management of funds, position development, and position management. In terms of position development, the new regulation clarifies that positions should be set up based on "demand-oriented recruitment, personnel-based recruitment, dynamic management, and quantitative control." The principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one position, self-initiated, and unified management" must be followed.  The recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment. In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for public welfare positions, and requires the relevant departments to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation of public welfare positions.

Translation:  II. Although right-wingers have had their moments of glory in history, they are short-lived because they shine too brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight and sweat when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they get a taste of power, they become arrogant and overbearing. However, in the process of social progress, right-wingers have played an active role. From defining the truth after the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of right-wingers cannot be denied.  III. Although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his views and highly respect Li Weidong as a person. He is sincere and serious about China and its social issues. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary and that revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil, damages people's livelihoods, and creates chaos in political parties. This is an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene.  IV. Changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Political opportunists who seek personal gain in the midst of chaos are not right-wingers, but troublemakers. Let's talk about the left.  The left is actually a political orphan of the times and politics. If right-wingers have positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of their views and analyze their thoughts when necessary. However, the left has lost its value because it is what the Communist Party discarded.  V. Recently, I have seen some friends who are angry at the right and criticize the left, but they are full of arrogance and pride. I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, it's all nonsense. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the traitors and leftists acknowledge us. Why bother? I tell my friends that when the right-wingers curse you and the leftists curse you, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but as they got older, they forgot their ideals or became dogmatic in pursuing them. Idealism fades away with time, and even the young become corrupt.  In general, right-wingers and left-wingers refer to constraints and freedom in China. Historically, China's overall tendency is biased towards the left due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese culture. Right-wingers in China are free and emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers emphasize supervision and fairness and safety. In today's society, there is a general desire for fairness, and with the US-China competition, a left-wing bias is expected to continue for a long time. Although it's hard to understand, just give it a thumbs up, and that's it.

Today, let's take a look at some "Strange Hot Searches". What is the normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Head Raised, Hua Liu Friend Price Hike, and the Goods Lala Incident. Public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then "the index drops" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion emerges, there will be a small peak again. They look exactly the same as the "Network Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in "peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" shapes. "Peak" means human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; "Sawtooth" means periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings; "Cliff" means collective withdrawal, the hot search fulfilling its "function" and being assigned to a new task, moving towards a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave exactly matches the valley of another event, with time difference of only a few seconds, which must be the Cyberspace Administration of China receiving a task and launching a new round of attacks. The professionalism of black public relations can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones incite war, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones mislead judgment, which ones provoke emotions, which ones encircle and suppress decisions, and black accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes. Almost all factors involved in the spread and diffusion of public opinion are considered. Dissemination is a science, and black public relations also has nowhere to hide when it comes to objective data. Data source: Hot Search Time Machine.
Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. Mauritius reported two cases of the Omicron variant on December 10, according to the Ministry of Health. One of the infected individuals was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, while the other was a local resident who had close contact with someone who had recently traveled to South Africa and tested positive on November 30. Both patients have since tested negative for the virus after being isolated and treated at hospitals. Cyprus's Health Ministry announced on December 10 that the country had confirmed three cases of the Omicron variant. All three patients were students who had returned to Cyprus from abroad earlier this month and had mild symptoms. They did not require hospitalization. To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Cypriot government has increased its efforts to control the spread of the virus. Starting from December 6 to January 10, all passengers over the age of 12 arriving in Cyprus by air will be required to take a PCR test at the airport at their own expense. Cyprus's Health Ministry also announced that it will begin administering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 in Cyprus. Malawi's Health Minister, Khumbize Chiponda, said on December 9 that the country had detected its first three cases of the Omicron variant. The country's health department sequenced the genes of 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three infected cases.

I don't think this will be of any help!
Received. The order is a golden belly. The phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained the situation.  Note: The above translation is a direct and literal translation. A more natural and fluent translation could be different depending on the context and purpose of the translation.
Your driver told me the address is too far.
The document is a review of a home renovation company called "大美360集成家装" located in Chongqing, China. The reviewer initially went to the company based on a recommendation from a friend, with an initial budget of 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation. However, upon arriving at the company, they were subjected to a series of fraudulent tactics. The company gave the reviewer an unrealistically low quote of 70,000 yuan for a 135 square meter house and did not provide any information about the quality or brand of the materials they would use. They also pressured the reviewer to pay a deposit upfront, claiming that it would be difficult to get the money back once it was paid. The reviewer fell for this trap and paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The company's quote had many problems, as it did not include the cost of water and electricity upgrades, bathroom renovations, or the cost of doors and cabinets, which are essential for basic renovations. The company's service fees were also higher than those of other companies. The reviewer lost trust in the company and signed a contract without fully understanding the terms. When the reviewer tried to get their money back, the company acted like they were experienced and had a special team to deal with customers. They blamed the customer for all the problems and refused to take responsibility. The reviewer warns others not to choose this company, as their friend's renovation project with the same company also had poor quality, and they were later charged for various fees. The reviewer concludes that the company is a scam and advises others to do their research and consult with experts before choosing a renovation company, as renovations can be expensive.
This is so terrifying, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel if it takes more than 15 minutes.
The chicken should be cooked, but the one I received is raw, and I can't eat it.
Already 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly fee plan! The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment, and now I have to pay for shipping every time. Can't you waive the monthly fee until you investigate and then collect it from me? Is this okay?
How can I contact the delivery specialist?
It's already 3 o'clock, don't you think it's time for me to receive compensation? I said I would knock on the door to send the package, but the delivery driver just left it at the door, and now someone has taken it.
Your delivery rider has already picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting. My delivery rider has received my order at 19:25, but they are still not willing to deliver it. I have finished buying my food, and I am wondering what to do. Where did your delivery rider go? Do I still need to wait?
I am a delivery person. If you don't cancel, I will report it.

"It's okay, just reply with the promotional code. Don't forget not to arrange a resend, I have already purchased it separately and don't want to waste it. Thank you for your help."
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of pollution and slander, and I cannot accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such scoundrels. If we do not consider political parties and factions, the first thing to resist should be this kind of uncivilized behavior. From the moment you start sending friend requests on Facebook and posting joking posts, to trying to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude. You may continue to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, and even continue to discuss about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, making some inappropriate and humiliating remarks about my appearance, figure, upbringing, what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed, and so on, I... have also had enough.  How did it come to pass that I received more than a dozen friend requests from various friends to upload a photo of you and post sexually suggestive remarks on your social media account? I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my report was uploaded, you did not show any sign of restraint, on the contrary, you became even more brazen. I don't care about your political background or your identity, in our society, mutual respect between the two sexes is required. Yes, you can continue with this kind of provocative, ambiguous, humiliating, and abusive language, you can continue to claim that you only care about and pay attention to me, you can even continue to deny that it's not your photo or continue to publish any attacking remarks.  Of course, I cannot and have no ability to stop you. I don't even know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need you to comment on them. I even don't believe that any woman would be willing to humiliate herself in exchange for fame. A friend asked me if I was okay, and I said yes, but you wouldn't believe it. I don't think any woman who has been subjected to such humiliation can still say she's okay. Whether in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who have no basic morality will choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice will be served. I have saved some of the comments for everyone to evaluate. You can't fake the comments you yourself posted, can you? I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
I have reported and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What kind of cow, there's no cow; it's just chicken soup, and the meat can't be eaten.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food and not leftovers?

High-speed Railway Residence: Address: No. 555, North 1 Road, High-speed Railway Station. Check the map here. This house is quite complete in terms of home appliances and brands, with many well-known brands. On the twelfth day of Double 12, go to "Hansdon" to see the water purifier. The store is currently having a promotion, and the price is quite reasonable. The residence has a total of 11 floors, from the second basement to the ninth floor, both basement levels are parking areas, and parking is free during the day! The surrounding area is not very attractive, with few restaurants and shops, and the food tastes average. The elevator in this building is also quite silent, with a big problem, from the second basement to the first floor, it keeps going up and down, and I pressed the button for this floor, but it didn't stop, and I had to get off at the first floor through the safety corridor, which was also quite silent, and then I went straight to a furniture store, but the store was closed, and I couldn't get out of the safety corridor! The High-speed Railway Residence still needs to be improved, with many places not yet developed. Address: No. 555, North 1 Road, High-speed Railway Station, convenient transportation, with a large parking lot, and parking is free during the day. Environment: The store is quite large, with 8-9 floors, where you can buy home furnishings, household appliances, and various small items... all the brands you want to buy are available, with many well-known brands such as Midea, Haier, Lao Boss, Fengyi, Wanjia Le, Daozheng, Hansdon, Yak, Youbang, Shengli, Zhonglian, Meidis, Yadan... The brand is really too much, and I can only remember so many. It's a good place to buy products, and if you're tired, you can sit on the sofa and rest. Recently, I wanted to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friends said that there were many sofas to choose from here. After looking at Jumei Home and Meike Home, I felt that they were okay, but the price was slightly higher, so I'm still hesitating. The High-speed Railway Residence provides the latest merchant information such as address, phone, business hours, etc. through the Urumqi Home Decoration Selling Channel, helping you find a decoration company.

The Yangtze River's mainstream has realized the full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas. Xinhua Net, December 11, 2022. Chongqing's Wushan Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was completed and put into operation on the 10th, becoming the second water-based green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Yizhuang Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing was put into operation on the 8th. With this, water-based green integrated service areas have covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau's deputy director, Qi Junhua, introduced that before this, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 water-based green integrated service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were recognized by a wide range of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation. The full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas on the Yangtze River is another milestone event in the construction of green navigation on the Yangtze River, and it has significantly improved the reception of Yangtze River ship pollutants and the service capabilities of navigation. According to introductions, water-based green integrated service areas are an important facility for providing comprehensive production, life, and public services to ships and ship crews, helping ship crews solve the "urgent, difficult, and worried" problem. The two water-based green integrated service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River that were put into operation this time are integrated with life, production, and public services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as the highlight, realizing "one-stop docking and multiple services" for inland ships, making it easier for ship crews to work and live on the Yangtze River.
