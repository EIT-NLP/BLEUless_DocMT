觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证 这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！ 普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。 众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。 这个时候便是需要急救的时候。 如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！ 所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！ 当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。 “在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。 在美国全国是平均15%能救过来。 在拉斯维加斯的赌场酒店，百分之七八十能救过来，上海、北京低于1%。” 这是第一反应创始人陆乐说的。 如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸没有了，心跳没有了，你掐人中是没有任何作用的。 必须做人工呼吸、胸外按压才有可能把人救过来。 我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。 说不定还能挽救一个人的生命！ 急救证可以在你们当地的红十字会培训中心报名，我是在珠海的红十字会培训中心报名的，学生还有优惠呢。 PS：最后一张图是记录自己25岁前要完成的目标的，把急救证加入目标清单也是几个月前的事情，但是确实是完成了呀！ 接着要去考其他想考的证书了，打算去考个潜水证，之前在小红书看到还有个潜水急救证，考这个证好像还得有急救证才可以去考，所以其实急救证还是很有用的！

ASSISTANT: Feels like a very meaningful certificate - the First Aid Certificate! This is one of the important skill certificates I think besides the driver's license! Let's popularize it: First Aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures taken in the event of an emergency before the arrival of the ambulance. As everyone knows, there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives, and this is the most critical period. This is the time when immediate first aid is needed. If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or stopped breathing, we only had a four-minute window of life, the golden four minutes! So, how important it is for people around us to know first aid! When someone collapses nearby, we can perform CPR on them using professional knowledge instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is so helpless and terrifying.

"In China, we have official data of 300,000 people dying in accidents annually. The most dangerous one is sudden cardiac arrest. In the United States, only 15% of people can be saved. In Las Vegas casino hotels, 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is below 1%. This is what the founder of the first response, Liu Le, said."

If a person has sudden cardiac arrest, breathing has stopped, and there is no pulse, performing CPR on them is completely useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save the person. I found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but it's too late when the situation arises. So, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make an immediate response in the event of an emergency. Who knows, we might even be able to save a life! The First Aid Certificate can be registered at the local Red Cross Society training center. I registered at the Red Cross Society training center in Zhuhai, and there are also discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of the goal I set for myself 25 years ago, and adding the First Aid Certificate to the goal list is something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it! Next, I plan to take other certificates I want to take, and I want to take the diving rescue certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving rescue certificate that requires the First Aid Certificate, so the First Aid Certificate is still quite useful!

ASSISTANT: The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission is piloting a modern apprenticeship system in 60 vocational schools starting from this year. Students who are accepted into the pilot schools will have the status of both apprentices and employees of the pilot enterprises. They will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees after they are admitted. The Education Commission requires that the admission and training programs of the vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices and employees of the pilot schools and enterprises be clarified. The three-party agreement between apprentices, their guardians, schools, and enterprises must be signed for apprentices who are under the age of 18. The agreement will determine the rights and obligations of each party and specify the specific positions, curriculum, benefits, and training content for the apprentices' on-the-job training. The pilot schools are encouraged to cooperate with enterprises to conduct pre-employment training and job transfers using the modern apprenticeship system. The pilot schools are required to reform their talent training models. The schools and enterprises should jointly design talent training plans, formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, position standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards, and implementation plans. The pilot period for talent training is one academic year, and the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the professional talent training plan, generally lasting six months. Enterprises should implement the team-based management mode in practice, and each teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that apprentices master the skills required for each training position. Starting from 2016 to 2019, Chongqing will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot schools in three batches, with each pilot school having about 50 students, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. The principle of "pilot first, then expand" will be followed, and the mechanism of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation will be explored to effectively improve the skills of students and increase their employment rate and job quality.

After using it for a period of time, the quality is good, and the screen resolution is also very clear. The frying effect is great, and it is perfect with one split into four. The logistics is fast, the product is good, and the second purchase is definitely a good product. The display picture quality is high, and it is not because of the large screen that it becomes distorted. The interface is complete. Overall, I am very satisfied.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症 南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。 据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。 该组织总监安本·皮莱（Unben Pillay）医生说，他每天都要看几十名病人，但是还没有任何病人需要住院。 皮莱说 ： “ 他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复 。 ” 他说，这包括老年患者和那些有健康问题的患者，这些人群本来更容易因冠状病毒感染而陷入重症。 他说，与之相比，在上一波的德尔塔疫情中，他治疗的新冠患者“呼吸困难，血氧水平低。 许多人几天内就要住院 ” 。 在南部非洲首次报告奥密克戎变异毒株后的两周内，其他医生也分享了类似的经验。 虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。 据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。 非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ” 他还说 ： “ 现在还是早期，我们需要获得后期数据。 通常情况下，住院和死亡发生的时间较晚，而我们进入这一波疫情的时间只有两周 。 ” 与此同时，世界各地的科学家正在观察病例数和住院率，同时测试目前的疫苗和治疗方法的效果。 尽管德尔塔仍然是全世界主要的新冠病毒株，但奥密克戎病例正在数十个国家出现，其中南非为疫情中心。 据卫生官员介绍，豪登省在12月的第一周发现的新病例增加了400 % ， 测试显示，奥密克戎变体的病例占90%以上。

ASSISTANT: South African Doctor: Although the transmission power of the Omicron variant is strong, it is mainly composed of mild cases. Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, the South African Medical Association reported that among the more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province, the symptoms of the patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of influenza. The organization's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. He said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are usually more likely to develop severe illness from the novel coronavirus. He said that compared to the Delta wave, the patients he treated during the previous wave "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to a summary by South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the recent hospitalized novel coronavirus patients, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospitalization time was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in the recent cases, only 3% died, while the death rate in the early outbreaks in South Africa was 20%. African Health Research Institute Director Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said, "Almost all the signs currently indicate that this is a relatively mild disease." He also said, "We are still in the early stages, and we need to wait for later data. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Although the Delta variant is still the main variant of the novel coronavirus worldwide, cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa serving as the center of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases in KwaZulu-Natal province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and testing showed that more than 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。 不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。 它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。 它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。 等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。 建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？ 对新手挺友好，但一过了新手阶段就鸡肋了，但大部分人，特别是女生，过不了新手阶段。

ASSISTANT: I would like to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it. So I want to find a similar-priced beginner's racket first. It's not friendly, and in fact, the price often corresponds to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive rackets will seem friendlier than cheap ones, and these "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have low strength, and when you hit the ball against them, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control them. The logic and hidden agenda behind their existence is that tennis is so difficult that you know you can't learn it, and you also know that you don't want to spend a lot of money on it. So they make cheap, mediocre rackets that won't let you play for long, and then you won't play tennis anymore. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've improved, and then you can come back here and buy a more expensive racket. I suggest spending a similar amount of money on a used racket from a reputable brand like Prince or Tecnifibre. These brands don't have a lot of name recognition, so good rackets don't sell for a high price. A new one costs around 500-600 dollars, while a used one costs around 200 dollars. Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy the benefits of a thousand-dollar racket for only 200 dollars? It's friendly to beginners, but once you pass the beginner stage, it's no longer suitable. However, most people, especially women, can't pass the beginner stage.

江西３年内将培训万名乡村小学音体美教师-新华网 新华社南昌５月２２日电（记者陈毓珊）记者近日从江西省教育厅获悉，为增强紧缺学科教师队伍保障能力，实现乡村义务教育均衡发展，自２０１６年起，江西省规划用３年时间为全省乡村（乡镇及以下）每所小学培训合格的音乐、美术、体育教师各１名，共计１万名。 据了解，这次培训对象为江西全省乡村小学４５岁以下具有音乐、美术、体育学科知识基础或才能，能兼任音乐、美术、体育课程的其他学科教师。 通过培训，使他们掌握音体美学科教学的基本知识和教学技能，更新教学思想和观念，掌握现代教学方法，提高学科教学能力、活动设计能力、校园文化能力及自我发展能力，建设一支一专多能的音体美教师队伍，缓解乡村音体美教师缺乏的问题。 为确保培训质量和效果，江西还规划为全省１００个县（市、区）小学音乐、美术、体育各培训１名，共计３００名培训者，全面提升他们的教学示范引领能力、教研活动设计组织能力、施训能力、网络研修工作坊建设能力，起到教授、示范、指导、监督的作用。

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。 身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。 裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。 过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。 如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。 其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。 穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。 如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。 越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。 以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。 对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。 微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。 当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。 胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。 短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔! 如果你是上身胖，但腿很瘦的MM，推荐选择华丽感的连衣短裙。 不但能遮住大肚皮，更能展现你的优点。 A字短裙会很显瘦，比较适合胖女孩，上衣要选择紧身一些的，形成层次感会更显瘦。 简简单单白T恤搭配短裙，胖MM也可以尝试。 微胖的女孩也是能够穿出时尚感的。 只要能够掌握好穿衣搭配的法则那么微胖的女孩子们也会是万众瞩目的焦点。 在穿衣搭配方面上有了改变后，在生活中也要多运动，争取早一天脱离微胖女生的标签吧😄

ASSISTANT: Actually, there are many requirements for the clothing coordination of girls with body fat. Girls with fat bodies should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length difference should be around the knee, which can just cover the fat thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat thighs. If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling. If you wear clothes in different lengths from top to bottom, it will make you look taller, and the use of different colors in the top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt will create a sense of lengthening. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard outfits for fat girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are a good way to hide your body fat. High-class and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice for fat girls. Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black short skirts, will make you look thinner. If your calves are fat, your socks and shoes should not be too noticeable. The more popular the color, the less noticeable it should be. Otherwise, people will focus on your legs and feet when you wear them, which will give you a fat feeling. For girls who are slightly overweight, it is definitely necessary to understand the principles of clothing coordination. Fat girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the upper body should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If your calves are fat, you can wear black long-sleeved socks or net socks (the kind with small holes, please). Choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match it with a ruffled top, which can effectively hide the fat of overweight girls. Of course, fat girls also need to pay attention to clothing coordination when wearing short skirts. When wearing short skirts, you should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make your fat body look taller. Short skirts matched with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look more slender, which is the hottest match in summer! If you are overweight above your waist but have slim legs, I recommend choosing a beautifully designed body-hugging short skirt. Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A-line skirts can make you look slimmer, which is more suitable for overweight girls. The upper body should choose a tight-fitting one to create a layering effect, which will make you look even slimmer. A simple white T-shirt can be matched with an A-line skirt, and overweight girls can also try it. Overweight girls can also show a sense of fashion. As long as you master the principles of clothing coordination, overweight girls will also become the focus of everyone's attention. After changing the way you dress, you should also pay more attention to exercise in your daily life and try to get out of the label of overweight girls as soon as possible.

I will come back to write a review after using it for a while. It is a new original product with a high cost-performance ratio, suitable for playing games. The design style is not bad. I have already installed Windows 11 and Office 2019. The display effect: I bought it for my child to do 3D rendering, and the software is installed. My child said it can be used without problem. This computer can do 3D design work well. I bought it for my son, and he said it was good. The computer is good, especially the customer service attitude is good. If you don't understand, they will explain it to you. I recommend buying it. It is not bad, and the game picture quality is really good.

号称新山区超跑排气声最大！ 这次我们团队为大家带来的这款车，是许多男人的梦想！ 它就是Lamborghini的旗舰超跑，Murcielago的换代车型 — Aventador LP700-4！ 要价马币近两百万，一年的路税马币十几千，四轮驱动，为什么叫LP700？ 因为拥有700匹的马力，你能想象有多快吗？ 那算了小编也不知道，数据说0-100km/h加速只需要2.9秒，大概就是小编的myvi才要到30km/h的时候人家就到100km/h了，嗯。 低矮的车身、嚣张的剪刀门、遍布车身四周的巨大进气口以及玻璃下一览无余的6.5 v12引擎，完美的诠释了兰博基尼的风格。 对于车款的说明不需要说太多，自己Google一下就好了，小编整理了一些Google不一定给的到的解说！ 太过备受瞩目，去到哪里大家都在看，很不自在！(其实有点爽) 1km油钱在RM1左右 (车主根本不care) 上下车的姿势要练习一下，不然会有点尴尬 (因为会爬不出车舱然后卡住一半) 引擎声太大，下车后会顿时耳聋。(不过还是很爽) 车身太大，停在普通停车位会很窄，很怕被隔壁车开门的时候敲到！ 有点寂寞，因为路上没有对手 (小编自己讲的，跟车主无关，哈哈) 大家不要误会，这视频的超跑并没有要出售，抱歉！ 想要为你的爱车拍摄视频的朋友，欢迎联系我们！ 更多你不知道的汽车资讯，就在 The Car Guide / 人民汽车志 牽扯到价值千万的车祸！ Bugatti Chiron 与 Porsche 911 相信车友们都认识，Chiron 是全球最贵超跑之一，而 Porsche 911 的车价也是百万等级！ 那日前，国外就在短短几分钟内撞掉了百万跑车 911 还有千万超跑 Chiron！ 看结果，贵是有道理的！

ASSISTANT: Claimed to be the fastest supercar exhaust sound in Shenzhen! This time, our team brings you this car, which is many men's dream! It is Lamborghini's flagship supercar, Murcielago's replacement model - Aventador LP700-4! With a price tag of almost two hundred thousand dollars and annual road tax of several thousand dollars, it is a four-wheel-drive car. Why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower. Can you imagine how fast it is? The data shows that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It's almost like myvi taking 30km/h to 100km/h, but Aventador LP700 does it in just 2.9 seconds! The low car body, aggressive scissor doors, huge air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen through the glass all perfectly interpret the Lamborghini style. As for the car model introduction, it's not necessary to say too much. Just Google it yourself, and I have summarized some explanations that may not be included in the search results! It's too eye-catching, and everyone is looking at it wherever it goes! (Actually, it's quite refreshing) 1km of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all), and you need to practice getting in and out of the car (because you might get stuck halfway out of the car). The engine sound is too loud, and you will suddenly become deaf after getting out of the car! (But it's still quite cool) The car body is too big, and parking in a regular parking space will be very narrow. It's afraid of being hit by neighboring cars when they open their doors! It's a bit lonely because there is no opponent on the road (I'm talking about myself, and it has nothing to do with the car owner, hahaha). Don't misunderstand, this supercar video does not intend to sell, sorry! If you want to shoot a video of your beloved car, please contact us! More car news that you don't know, just wait for The Car Guide / People's Car Chronicle, where car disasters with a value of millions of dollars are discussed! Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and Porsche 911's car price is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, several high-priced supercars, including Porsche 911 and Bugatti Chiron, were crashed in just a few minutes abroad! The result shows that it is reasonable to be expensive!

ASSISTANT: The maximum length of a university student's leave of absence for entrepreneurship in Guangxi can reach up to 5 years, according to a recent report from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department. Starting from the next academic year, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, allowing students to extend their leave of absence for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years, and the time spent on entrepreneurship can be considered as practical education time. In order to enhance the innovation and entrepreneurship capabilities of university students, the Education, Human Resources and Social Security departments in Guangxi have jointly built entrepreneurship platforms, constructed more university-based practical teaching bases, science and technology parks, student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external support for university students' entrepreneurship. By 2020, the total area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in all universities in Guangxi should reach 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and 2,000 square meters for vocational schools. The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credit courses, and gives priority to students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to switch their majors. University teachers are required to spend at least two months on-the-job training in industries and enterprises every two years, in order to enhance their awareness and ability to teach innovation and entrepreneurship. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department requires all universities in the region to thoroughly implement the university student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, and strive to ensure that every university student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their studies. Universities are encouraged to actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网 新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。 牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。 该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。 许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。 赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。 美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。 赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。 他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。 目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。 亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。 此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

ASSISTANT: A coalition of 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against the admission discrimination faced by three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - in their recruitment process. The coalition held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint. The coalition's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three U.S. universities has increased tenfold in the past decade, but their proportion in these universities has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called "holistic consideration" admission process, which is "long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian-American applicants." Zhao Yuxuan introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among the members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, while Harvard University and Brown University had been practicing de facto racial quotas for Asian-American students for over 20 years. Zhao Yuxuan told reporters from China News Service that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department would investigate and take measures to stop these three universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American students in their admission process. They also hoped that the universities would proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-American students. Currently, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Asian-American Education Union was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, the coalition also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。 同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。 林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。” 然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。 考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。 好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。 为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。 法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。 一审判决后，原告提起上诉。 近日，二审法院维持原判。 【律师提醒】 在交易过程中要尽到必要的审慎注意义务。 在签订合同时，作为买方要尽到必要的审慎注意义务，比如，核实房屋所有权人信息、房屋是否被人占用等相关信息，并在合同中明确关于交付的具体时间、地点，以防履行合同时双方产生争议。

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Shaoxing Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang Province from an agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to buy the factory building. In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Liu transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer. Ms. Lin signed the "Factory Building Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer, and both parties agreed to sign a factory building purchase and sale contract within a week. However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main terms of the contract, such as the sales range and payment method, the factory building purchase and sale contract was never signed. After several days, Ms. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Liu. It was difficult for Mr. Liu to find a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Liu filed a lawsuit against Ms. Lin in Yongjia City People's Court. The court held that the parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. The court ruled that the defendant did not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first instance ruling, the plaintiff filed an appeal. Recently, the second instance court maintained the original judgment. [Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary caution and attention obligations. When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary caution and attention obligations, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and clearly stating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when the contract is performed.

红牌威士忌喝法是什么？ 每个人的爱好不同，有人喜欢收藏，有人喜欢美食，当然也有人喜欢品酒，红牌威士忌是目前各个国家最畅销的苏格兰威士忌之一，而且红牌威士忌曾获国际洋酒大赛金奖。 每一瓶红牌威士忌都有独特的味道，不过如果不知道如何品味它，岂不是糟蹋了它的醇香。 那么红牌威士忌怎么喝呢？ 小编为大家简单介绍下。 红牌威士忌喝法： 尊尼获加红牌威士忌由约35种苏格兰威士忌调配而成，具有浓郁芳香及传统苏格兰威士忌的特质，浓郁芳香中带有甘甜及烟熏香味。 入口浓醇清新，略带香草及浓烈的烟熏麦芽味道。 该酒可以直接加冰饮用，或者与最喜爱的饮品混合饮用。 红牌威士忌进入国内,为了适应国人的口味,红牌威士忌+可乐或雪碧或新奇士等气泡饮料成为一种经久不衰的时尚。 这些甜味的饮料，除了可以中和酸味,在视觉上能给人带来愉悦，加入饮料,起到冲淡酒味改变口感的效果。 红牌威士忌+切片柠檬+方糖(砂糖亦可),是最正宗、最传统的喝法. 正宗的红方威味道有些酸涩,加入糖可以中和其中的酸味,柠檬则会给酒带来清新的香味,当然,甜酸度可根据个人的口味爱好调配。 以上三种都是红牌威士忌的最好喝法，大家可以作为参考尝试下，希望小编的介绍可以帮助到大家。

金夫人婚纱摄影(南街店) 暂时还没有分店 拍照之前因为我们时间没安排好，更换了两次时间，顾问兰兰很耐心地帮我们安排了时间。 后来选择了一个天气好的周末拍的。 金夫人的工作人员，无论是顾问，化妆师还是摄影师都超赞的。 那是我生平第一次正式地化妆，哇～简直不敢相信，我有一天也会变得那么好看，哈哈。 晓洁和另一个妹子（抱歉我记不得名字了）化妆超级有耐心，化妆也很自然。 外景在江湾城拍的，幸亏那天天气很好，没有觉得很冷，拍照的时候，化妆师时不时地留意我们的衣服，头饰，稍微有一点不好了就马上帮我们整理。 摄影师也非常幽默，拍照一天下来都觉得很开心。 在选照片的时候，因为在网上看到很多案例，不愿意让客人删太多照片，但是我们选照片的时候，真的，一点没有让我们加照片的意思，直接套餐里的24张，一张都没有加（听说和我差不多时间拍婚纱照的表妹，七千多的套餐还加了一万多的照片，当时我就惊呆了，心里也很怕自己会选太多） 今天照片修好了，兰兰发给我，我看了有两张觉得不太好，他们立刻就帮我重新修了。 把妹妹以前拍的照片翻出来对比，我觉得我们的照片我真的太满意了，简约清新，就是我想要的风格。 真心推荐大家去宣汉金夫人拍婚纱照！ 套系价格：3999 元 金夫人感恩有你们真心祝愿你们幸福美满，前程似锦！ 这一套多少钱啊

Golden Flower Man Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have a branch. Before the photo shoot, because we didn't arrange the time properly, we had to change the time twice. The consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a sunny weekend day for the photo shoot. The staff of Golden Flower Man were all amazing, whether they were consultants, makeup artists, or photographers. It was my first time having professional makeup done, and I was amazed. I couldn't believe that I would look that good one day. The makeup artist, Jiajia, and my other sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did an amazing job with the makeup, and it looked very natural. The photo shoot was held in Hangzhou City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so we didn't feel too cold. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothing and accessories from time to time, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel very happy during the photo shoot. When we were choosing the photos, we didn't want to take too many photos online because we saw a lot of examples, but when we were choosing the photos, we didn't add any extra ones (I heard that my cousin, who took her wedding photos, added over a thousand extra photos to her seven-thousand-yuan package, and I was shocked and scared that I would choose too many). The photos were edited today, and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at two of them and thought they weren't that good, so they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who took our photos before with our photos, I was very satisfied with our photos. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I really recommend everyone to go to Hangzhou Golden Flower Man for their wedding photos! Package price: 3,999 yuan. Golden Flower Man thanks you for your sincere wishes and hopes that you will be happy and prosperous! How much is this package?

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货 （亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。 不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。 他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。 他说，有关问题在2个月前就出现，砂拉越也面对同样的问题。 “其中一个原因是生产特制防伪纸的中国厂家受疫情影响，导致延迟运抵我国 。 ” 他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。 凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。 “该局下周四将派人到吉隆坡取货，回到沙巴立刻进行最后阶段的打印，估计多2个工作日（12月20日）就可以交到申请者手上 。 ” “我们会通知申请者前往各地分局领取报生纸 。 ” 他补充，沙巴今年至今共发出2万4801张报生纸。

ASSISTANT: In Sabah, 3,200 newborn babies have yet to receive their birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates for newborn babies because the stock of anti-forgery paper has been used up. As a result, the number of affected individuals has reached 3,200. However, the department's director, Kharudin Amins, assured that all applications for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and that the certificates will be issued as soon as the anti-forgery paper arrives next week. He explained that the issue has been ongoing for more than 10 months, and that Sarawak is also facing the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces the anti-forgery paper has been affected by the pandemic, causing a delay in the delivery of the paper to Malaysia," he said. Amins added that the anti-forgery paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, and cannot be borrowed from other states. He revealed that the latest batch of anti-forgery paper has already arrived in Kuala Lumpur on December 6, and will be given to the printing company on December 8 for partial printing work. "The National Registration Department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the paper, and it is estimated that the birth certificates will be ready for distribution within two to three working days (by December 20)," he said. Amins said that the department will notify applicants to collect their birth certificates from the respective district offices. He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

It's even more super convenient than using a computer, solving the problem of insufficient hard drive space on my computer. Today's brand-new 2.5-inch solid-state drive is not recognized by my computer, but it can be read by a USB drive. The machine is light and handy, with a stylish appearance. I used it for a few hours today, and it dissipates heat very well. I basically didn't feel any heat, and the running speed is very fast, with 99% of users opening the machine in under a second. The battery is also very powerful, lasting for 9 hours after being fully charged, and it should be fine to use for 4 hours. Overall, this price can buy a machine with such quality, and I feel very happy. I will discover other functions later and add them later. The appearance is not bad. In terms of performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a period of time. The machine is fast, much faster than I imagined, with excellent rendering effect, and I like it very much. I will wait for a while before giving a detailed evaluation. It's great, and the serial number I checked in Hong Kong appears to be of good quality. The machine feels a bit heavy, but it's only slightly heavier than a 15.6-inch laptop, and it runs very stably. I didn't feel any lag, and the fan sound of heat dissipation is very pleasant. It's also great that it doesn't keep turning things on and off like a game console. The price is much cheaper than official flagship stores, and it even comes with a backpack. I think it's great. The service of the store is also very good, reminding me to update the BIOS and promptly offering a replacement. It's worth it! The heat dissipation effect is very good, with basically no heat. The portability level is very convenient, and the appearance material is the traditional Thinkpad design, which satisfies me. The seller is trustworthy, and I carefully checked the entire machine exterior, all interfaces, and there were no signs of refurbishment or use. It is indeed a brand-new and beautiful machine, with the same configuration as the page. I forgot to send the backpack, but the seller immediately sent a backpack to me, although it was not the original factory backpack, but the after-sales service was good enough to prove that it was a conscientious seller. If you need to buy a notebook, please recommend it to your friends. The appearance material is stylish, and the display effect is clear and sharp. The portability level is relatively heavy, but the feeling of holding a heavier thing is better. The heat dissipation effect will be evaluated later. The keyboard typing feels very good, and a mouse and a transformer are also included in the configuration, which is more cost-effective than domestic brands. Overall, the price is reasonable, and the machine's performance should be evaluated after using it for a period of time. This screen is really comfortable! The use is very smooth, and I will wait for a while before giving a detailed evaluation.

ASSISTANT: President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Believes China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during a special period - Xinhua Net, December 11, 2022

The president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently said that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during a special period.

Recently, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yiping, met with Kvesic in Sarajevo. During the meeting, Kvesic actively evaluated the relationship between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina and said that he had visited China during the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008 and was deeply impressed by China's excellent organizational work. He believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during a special period, and Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing the event, and Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to use this opportunity to further expand exchanges and cooperation in sports with China.

Yiping said that China and Bosnia and Herzegovina have a special "Olympic belt" relationship. The 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also be held, presenting a simple, safe, and spectacular show to the world. He hopes that the two countries will deepen exchanges and cooperation in winter sports preparations and athlete training, and that the Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina will continue to play a bridge role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the cultural exchange between the two countries to make the two peoples "move towards the future" and wish that the athletes of Bosnia and Herzegovina will perform well in Beijing.

Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held a ceremony to award the "Best Athlete of the Year" and invited Yiping as a special guest to present the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The promotional videos of the Beijing Winter Olympics were played on a loop at the event.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网 新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。 根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。 此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。 国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。 实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。 近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。 上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。 通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。 通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。 根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control measures in border cities within 48 hours of obtaining a negative nucleic acid test result. Those traveling to border cities from outside the country must take a nucleic acid test within 48 hours of departure and undergo at least one nucleic acid test upon arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government to March 15, 2022. In addition, border cities with conditions can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control. The National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office said that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and people from both sides travel frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies will turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of controlling the spread of the epidemic by closing the border and reducing the risk of epidemic spillover, with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost. Recently, several domestic cluster outbreaks have occurred, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice pointed out that some places have problems with the timely monitoring and warning of epidemics, the closed-loop management of high-risk positions, the formalism of regular nucleic acid testing, the insufficient disinfection of cold-chain products, the unstandardized management of centralized isolation facilities, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic control. The notice requires efforts to be made from nine aspects, including improving the mechanism for border city epidemic prevention and control, strengthening the monitoring and early warning system for epidemics, implementing border control measures, and publishing and promoting the hotline for ensuring people's livelihood security.

油管视频起底美军20年嗜血杀戮真相-新华网 （视频来源：油管） 12月11日，油管平台一条名为《杀戮机器》的微纪录片引起广泛关注。 该片讲述了美国以“反恐”为名发动阿富汗战争，通过战争强行输出美式民主，20年穷兵黩武、嗜血成性、滥杀无辜，犯下种种反人类罪行。 滥用无人机空袭医院、学校等民用场所，扭曲人性，成立杀人小组。 20年来，美军杀害了数万阿富汗无辜平民。 美军设“黑狱”对“嫌犯”施加种种酷刑、人身羞辱。 一桩桩反人类罪行激起更多阿富汗人的仇恨。 正如视频所说，美式“反恐”战争“越反越恐 ” 。 战争没有给阿富汗人民带去和平民主、繁荣希望，带去的只有满目疮痍的国家和无数的杀戮破坏。 戳视频，让我们一起来揭穿美国以“反恐”为名，嗜血杀戮的真相，戳穿美式民主的虚伪假面！

ASSISTANT: Oil pipeline video reveals the truth behind 20 years of US bloodthirsty killing spree in Afghanistan - Xinhua Net (Video source: Oil Pipeline)

On December 11, a video titled "Killing Machine" was posted on the Oil Pipeline platform, attracting widespread attention. The video tells the story of how the US, using the pretext of "anti-terrorism," launched a war in Afghanistan to forcibly export American-style democracy, committing 20 years of barbarous, bloodthirsty, and sadistic crimes, including the murder of innocent civilians.

Using drone strikes to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, the US has twisted human nature and established a killing squad. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians. The US has set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation. The more atrocities committed against humanity, the more Afghans' hatred towards the US grows.

As the video says, the "War on Terror" waged by the US "is becoming more and more terrifying." The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only left the country with a nation riddled with scars and countless acts of destruction.

Watch the video and let's expose together the truth behind the 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree carried out by the US under the guise of "anti-terrorism," as well as the hypocrisy and false face of American-style democracy!

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网 逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。 现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。 等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。 正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。 这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。 因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。 对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。 绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。 马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。 “最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。 或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。 “次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。 总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。 由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。 只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。 总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: Don't push people over the starting line - Xinhua Net When you browse books in a bookstore, you often feel the popularity of success-oriented books. Today's successful books often claim to be "the best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental "how to do it" phase. As a result, these books all have a common characteristic - either they do everything to the best of their ability or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100 or they are 0; either they climb to the top of the mountain or they stay put where they are. This "best principle" is so convincing that everyone will admit that it is "absolutely correct," but 99% of people will be pushed over the starting line before they even begin. Because this theory encourages a path that says, "You must make up your mind, change your personality, and make a 180-degree turn," which is the fatal weakness of many people. For those who insist on following the rules, adhering to the old ways, and rejecting change, it is self-deception to tell them to "change" when they are deaf to it. Most people will be intimidated by the word "change" and hesitate to take the first step. They either can't make up their minds or, relying on a momentary impulse, make a rash decision to "change" and then bravely take the first step, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain their determination. The famous song "From Tomorrow" by Mr. Ma Sanliang is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, making them "gasp in admiration" when they see it. Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way for more ordinary people to take a path to relative success. The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory that says, "small victories lead to great victories." That is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb the mountain, just climb the small hill in front of your house, because it's better than standing still. In summary, as long as you do something, it's stronger than not doing anything. Since the threshold is lowered, it increases the possibility of ordinary people persisting in their efforts, and as long as they persist, the success probability increases. However, following the path of the "second-best principle" requires a slightly longer journey. In summary, although the "best principle" flies the flag of making everyone successful on the surface, it ultimately only inspires a small number of people; while the "second-best principle" can effectively inspire more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网 新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。 青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。 20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。 2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。 从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。 与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。 青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。 青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。 为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。

ASSISTANT: According to the latest monitoring results, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection period in 2002, it has increased by more than 40 times. Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Mi'er" in local dialect, is a precious fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Qinghai Lake carp population was severely reduced due to large-scale fishing, habitat degradation, and other factors. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2,592 tons. In 2004, it was listed as an endangered species in the Chinese Red List of Endangered Species. Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its tributary rivers, prohibiting any units, groups, or individuals from fishing, selling, or processing Qinghai Lake carp and its products. Simultaneously, through artificial breeding and releasing, habitat cleanup, and the design of scientific and reasonable "passageways" for fish migration, the protection measures have been continuously strengthened, resulting in an annual increase in the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp. Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau deputy director Yang Lin introduced that, as of now, nearly 1.8 billion carp fry have been artificially bred and released for the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources, with a contribution rate of over 23%. Qinghai Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area for China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the Gobi Desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the Qinghai Lake watershed, maintain biological diversity in the Qing-Zang Plateau, and prevent the expansion of the Gobi Desert to the east, Qinghai Province has recently issued notices on the comprehensive ban of fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Qinghai Lakes, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system covering "one river, one lake, one reservoir".

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？ 选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。 随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。 在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。 “在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!” 李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。 李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。 李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。 后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。 因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。 但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。 因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。 水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。 同时你可以随便拿电笔测。

ASSISTANT: Is the foot bath tank leaking electricity? Can the right foot bath tank bring health benefits? Today, the editors of Country美小编 will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath tanks are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tanks and other health-related household appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tanks, so there are certain safety risks. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath tank as a gift for his father's birthday, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them. At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath tank, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath tank was electric. Later, he contacted the store, and although the store was willing to refund the foot bath tank, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular foot bath tank, which has been around for a long time, lacks clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees. However, in general, foot bath tanks do not have electricity problems, but there is a small number of products that may not have been strictly inspected during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath tank. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. At the same time, you can take a pen to test.

ASSISTANT: Time-lapse photography is still not available in stores, but there are member reviews. The effect of the photo: I took two sets of clothes, and overall, it's not bad. I really like this set of photos. The service details: Because I was pregnant and doing makeup, it was a bit uncomfortable. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest in the corner while constantly giving me hot water. The package price: 1000 yuan. Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally, I was going to refuse the ancient style, but the final product was so beautiful that I didn't expect it. Thank you for the recognition of Dan Dan. Your satisfaction makes us full of energy to continue forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all little friends to come! From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no compromise. The makeup artist is particularly delicate, and she will match your style to create a suitable makeup for you. The makeup products used are all first-line brands. Teacher Yang is even more professional in photography. The whole studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little cats playing around. We work in Beijing and need to line up half a year in advance for good studios. My colleagues who have taken photos in Beijing said they were just so-so. I specially searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude. We are not good at managing our facial expressions, which is a common problem for most people. The photographer, Mr. Yang, will take pictures and record the natural beauty of the moment. The makeup artist, photographer, and post-production designer are a luxurious team. When the film comes out, we and the people around us all praise it. I have already recommended it to my friends, and my friends who saw the film were also very satisfied. I hope more people can discover such studios, take photos in their own style, and not just follow the same formula. Thank you very much for the five-star review from Hao Xiong and Xing Liang. Both of them are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the job if the customer likes it. Thank you for the sweet and thoughtful assistant and the lively and open-minded photographer teacher. Everyone in the team is super nice. It was a beautiful shooting experience, and it was hard to forget. The effect of the shooting was much better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘 Thank you for the review from Xiao Yu. Getting to know you is also a kind of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to get to know you, and I look forward to seeing you again in Qinhuangdao next time.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。 如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。 但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。 要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。 当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。 首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。 其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。 你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。 比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。 如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。 但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。 另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。 如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。 而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。 以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

ASSISTANT: A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training institution to learn, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and it takes six months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are weak in self-study. If you have a relatively strong self-study ability, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. Firstly, you need to see the strength of the institution's teachers. If the teacher strength is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions have teacher strength that is not particularly strong. Secondly, before choosing a training institution, you should investigate the students of this institution, because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the teaching is. You know, I actually don't know how to answer your question because I don't have any introduction to your situation. Learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship. For example, your professional, age, desired language, even in which city, all of these will have a relationship with your learning or the industry you want to engage in. If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer major, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest that you self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is relatively large, basically need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months. But if you self-study, it is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the network, or you can also find many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos to learn. If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain cost and time for learning, then I suggest going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much money, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. There are also people who specialize in answering questions. Moreover, many training institutions now have employment agreements, and they have internal recommendations and can help you find a job after you graduate. This way, you can save a lot of trouble in the interview process when looking for a job after graduation. These are some of my opinions. I didn't introduce them in detail because I didn't know your situation. If you have other questions to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and communication.

With heartfelt service and cleaning, we can leave behind beauty. The details you care about are what I can do for you, and I am committed to serving my family. We strive to make every house clean and tidy, carve out a reputation for our housekeeping services, provide excellent service, and make every house clean and tidy.

We believe that every detail counts, and we strive to create a refined and exquisite work. We are committed to our work. Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied.

One day's plan begins with the morning. All the beauty starts from the morning. I hope you can start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything going well. Maintain a good mood all day long. When we were young, happiness was a thing, and having it made us happy; when we grew up, happiness became a goal, and achieving it made us happy; and when we became mature, we found that happiness was a state of mind, and understanding it made us happy. Do your best to be the most authentic and kindest version of yourself, and live your life without regrets. Life is one road, and we must walk our own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, and we can shine until we are old. At each stage of life, we will encounter different challenges. Sometimes, what binds us is not our ability, but our courage to face it. Since we cannot avoid it, we might as well face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be knocked down by difficulties; but if you face them bravely, problems will eventually be solved.

中沙策展人携手举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展-新华网 新华社利雅得12月12日电（记者王海洲 胡冠）沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展 — — 迪里耶当代艺术双年展，于11日在位于沙特首都利雅得西北部的迪里耶JAX艺术区正式向公众开放，共有来自沙特、中国等地的64位艺术家参展。 本次双年展由沙特迪里耶双年展基金会和中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心联合策划，中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心馆长田霏宇担任艺术总监。 据策展团队介绍，本次双年展的主题为“摸着石头过河 ” ， 隐喻社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当下境遇。 本次双年展占地近12000平方米，展厅横跨六个相互连接的建筑，以六个单元呈现 ： 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 。 其中，27位沙特艺术家的作品数量占本次展品总量的四成以上，囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品同样备受关注，有的艺术家以新颖的方式使用回收材料进行创作，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图 》 （ 2014）中，用废弃物重构了一幅经典山水画。 迪里耶双年展基金会首席执行官巴克利表示，希望本届双年展能够建立国际对话，让全球观众有机会了解沙特蓬勃发展的文化产业和创意社区，加强互动往来。 田霏宇说 ： “ 双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特观众融入当代艺术世界 。 ” 据了解，在双年展开幕周期间还将举办系列讲座，艺术家、策展人和创意行业的意见领袖将就跨文化交流、当代艺术发展等主题展开讨论。

ASSISTANT: The first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia was held in the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of the capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other regions participated in the exhibition. The exhibition was co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. UCCA Center for Contemporary Art Director Tian Weituo served as the art director of the exhibition. According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching the Stone and Crossing the River," which reflects the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation and the current situation of cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is composed of six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching the Stone and Crossing the River," "Tradition as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounts for more than four-fifths of the total number of works, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, etc. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also well-received, some of whom use recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's "The Story Behind the Mountains Is Endless" series (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting with discarded objects. Diriyah Biennial Foundation Chairman Bakkali said he hoped that this biennial exhibition could establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia and strengthen exchanges and interactions. Tian Weituo said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, allowing Saudi Arabian contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue and allowing Saudi Arabian audiences to enter the world of contemporary art." It is reported that during the opening week of the exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and opinion leaders in the fields of art, curators, and the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网 新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。 云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。 此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。 在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。 招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。 此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net
Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the orderly management of public welfare positions in rural areas, consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, and assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security introduced that at present, a total of 44.83 million public welfare positions have been developed in Yunnan, which are used to provide employment for impoverished labor forces and other difficult groups in rural areas, and have played an important role in helping impoverished populations achieve employment growth, consolidate poverty alleviation results, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas.

This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the Rural Revitalization Office, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, the management of funds, position development, and position management. In terms of position development, the new regulation clarifies that positions should be set up based on "demand-oriented recruitment, personnel-based recruitment, dynamic management, and quantitative control." The principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one position, self-initiated, and unified management" must be followed.

The recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment. In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for public welfare positions, and requires the relevant departments to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation of public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。 但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。 从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。 三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。 但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。 四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。 再聊聊左。 左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。 如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！ 五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。 跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。 也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？ 我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！ 许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。 和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。 左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。 而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。 现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。 虽然看不懂，点赞就完事儿啦 啥也不说了，花花就是这么仗义

ASSISTANT: Translation:

II. Although right-wingers have had their moments of glory in history, they are short-lived because they shine too brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight and sweat when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they get a taste of power, they become arrogant and overbearing. However, in the process of social progress, right-wingers have played an active role. From defining the truth after the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of right-wingers cannot be denied.

III. Although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his views and highly respect Li Weidong as a person. He is sincere and serious about China and its social issues. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary and that revolution inevitably leads to social turmoil, damages people's livelihoods, and creates chaos in political parties. This is an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene.

IV. Changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Political opportunists who seek personal gain in the midst of chaos are not right-wingers, but troublemakers. Let's talk about the left.

The left is actually a political orphan of the times and politics. If right-wingers have positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of their views and analyze their thoughts when necessary. However, the left has lost its value because it is what the Communist Party discarded.

V. Recently, I have seen some friends who are angry at the right and criticize the left, but they are full of arrogance and pride. I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, it's all nonsense. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the traitors and leftists acknowledge us. Why bother? I tell my friends that when the right-wingers curse you and the leftists curse you, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but as they got older, they forgot their ideals or became dogmatic in pursuing them. Idealism fades away with time, and even the young become corrupt.

In general, right-wingers and left-wingers refer to constraints and freedom in China. Historically, China's overall tendency is biased towards the left due to the innate genetic factors of Chinese culture. Right-wingers in China are free and emphasize efficiency and development, while left-wingers emphasize supervision and fairness and safety. In today's society, there is a general desire for fairness, and with the US-China competition, a left-wing bias is expected to continue for a long time. Although it's hard to understand, just give it a thumbs up, and that's it.

ASSISTANT: Today, let's take a look at some "Strange Hot Searches". What is the normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 Dragon Head Raised, Hua Liu Friend Price Hike, and the Goods Lala Incident. Public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then "the index drops" (smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion emerges, there will be a small peak again. They look exactly the same as the "Network Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in "peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" shapes. "Peak" means human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; "Sawtooth" means periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings; "Cliff" means collective withdrawal, the hot search fulfilling its "function" and being assigned to a new task, moving towards a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave exactly matches the valley of another event, with time difference of only a few seconds, which must be the Cyberspace Administration of China receiving a task and launching a new round of attacks. The professionalism of black public relations can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones incite war, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones mislead judgment, which ones provoke emotions, which ones encircle and suppress decisions, and black accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes. Almost all factors involved in the spread and diffusion of public opinion are considered. Dissemination is a science, and black public relations also has nowhere to hide when it comes to objective data. Data source: Hot Search Time Machine.

毛里求斯等国首次发现奥密克戎毒株感染病例-新华网 新华社北京12月12日电 综合新华社驻外记者报道：毛里求斯、塞浦路斯和马拉维近日首次报告发现新冠变异病毒奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 毛里求斯10日首次报告该国两例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 据毛卫生部长凯莱什·贾古特帕尔介绍，一名感染者为自南非出发于11月27日抵达毛里求斯的游客；另一名感染者为毛里求斯本地居民，他与一名近期曾前往南非后返回的人员接触后，于11月30日核酸检测呈阳性。 经医院隔离治疗后，这两名感染者核酸检测结果均转为阴性，目前已返回各自的居住地。 塞浦路斯卫生部10日宣布该国首次确诊3例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 这3人都是学生，本月初从国外旅行回来，由于均为轻症，并未入院治疗。 为防范奥密克戎毒株蔓延，塞政府不断加大防控力度。 从12月6日到明年1月10日，乘飞机入境的12岁以上旅客抵塞后都需自费在机场接受核酸检测。 塞卫生部10日还宣布，将开始为该国5岁至11岁的儿童接种辉瑞新冠疫苗。 马拉维卫生部长昆比泽·奇蓬达9日说，该国首次发现3例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 该国卫生部门对从11月9日至12月2日采集的12个新冠阳性样本开展基因组测序，发现了这3例感染病例。

ASSISTANT: Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. Mauritius reported two cases of the Omicron variant on December 10, according to the Ministry of Health. One of the infected individuals was a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, while the other was a local resident who had close contact with someone who had recently traveled to South Africa and tested positive on November 30. Both patients have since tested negative for the virus after being isolated and treated at hospitals. Cyprus's Health Ministry announced on December 10 that the country had confirmed three cases of the Omicron variant. All three patients were students who had returned to Cyprus from abroad earlier this month and had mild symptoms. They did not require hospitalization. To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Cypriot government has increased its efforts to control the spread of the virus. Starting from December 6 to January 10, all passengers over the age of 12 arriving in Cyprus by air will be required to take a PCR test at the airport at their own expense. Cyprus's Health Ministry also announced that it will begin administering the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 in Cyprus. Malawi's Health Minister, Khumbize Chiponda, said on December 9 that the country had detected its first three cases of the Omicron variant. The country's health department sequenced the genes of 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three infected cases.

大美360集成家装 地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼 一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。 来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。 我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。 他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。 我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。 这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。 他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。 除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。 我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。 当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。 无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。 各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。 坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。 所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。 以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。 想要向商家提问，请先登录或注册 严禁发布各种形式的商家点评，详细请见商户收录声明 大众点评昆明装修设计频道为您提供大美360集成家装地址，电话，营业时间等最新商户信息，找装修公司装修公司，就上大众点评

ASSISTANT: The document is a review of a home renovation company called "大美360集成家装" located in Chongqing, China. The reviewer initially went to the company based on a recommendation from a friend, with an initial budget of 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation. However, upon arriving at the company, they were subjected to a series of fraudulent tactics. The company gave the reviewer an unrealistically low quote of 70,000 yuan for a 135 square meter house and did not provide any information about the quality or brand of the materials they would use. They also pressured the reviewer to pay a deposit upfront, claiming that it would be difficult to get the money back once it was paid. The reviewer fell for this trap and paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The company's quote had many problems, as it did not include the cost of water and electricity upgrades, bathroom renovations, or the cost of doors and cabinets, which are essential for basic renovations. The company's service fees were also higher than those of other companies. The reviewer lost trust in the company and signed a contract without fully understanding the terms. When the reviewer tried to get their money back, the company acted like they were experienced and had a special team to deal with customers. They blamed the customer for all the problems and refused to take responsibility. The reviewer warns others not to choose this company, as their friend's renovation project with the same company also had poor quality, and they were later charged for various fees. The reviewer concludes that the company is a scam and advises others to do their research and consult with experts before choosing a renovation company, as renovations can be expensive.

USER: Translate the following document from Chinese to English.

从以前到现在，我都反对任何形式的污蔑和谩骂，更不能接受这类人身攻击的行为。 在文明社会，我们可以包容一切，但就是要杜绝这种恶棍。 如果不看政党和派系，要先抵制的，就是这种不文明的作风。 从你开始发来脸书加好友请求开始，进而发表具调侃性的帖子，再到你试图把所谓我的家地点和父亲名字发布在社交媒体上，我都已经采取不回应的态度。 你过后变本加厉地不只按一日六餐的频率持续tag我，更在脸书跟你的所谓朋友们继续肆无忌惮地讨论着关于我一些隐晦、羞辱的言论，样貌、身材、好生养、又什么床上种草莓、要不要插之类的留言，我...也算了。 怎知后来我更收到多位朋友发来有关你的脸书朋友户口上载一张你的照片和具性骚扰成分的言论。 抱歉，作为一位女生，我再也无法继续沉默了。 我报警的新闻上载后，你完全没有收敛，反而更越发嚣张。 我不理你是什么政治背景，也不管你是什么身份地位，在我们的社会，是需要两性尊重的。 是的，你们可以继续这种具调侃性、隐晦、羞辱、辱骂的言论，你也可以继续说你只是关爱和关注我，你可以继续认为这并不是骚扰、你甚至可以继续否认那不是你制的图或者继续发表一切攻击性言论。 没错，我不能，也没有能力阻止你们。 我既不认识你，也不想认识你，我的样貌和身材更不需要你评头论足。 我甚至不认为会有哪一位女生愿意让别人如此地羞辱自己来换来出名。 朋友问我，还好吗？ 我说好，你也不会信。 我觉得不会有任何一位女生被如此霸凌后还可以说自己还好。 无论在工作、社会、政坛或商界，只有那些连基本品德都没有的人，才会选择用这种方式来伤害任何一位女性。 我相信，公道自在人心。 我截了部分留言给大家评理 你自己发的贴应该没有人可以冒充你了吧 我只能说你是文明的公敌 会心一笑

ASSISTANT: From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of pollution and slander, and I cannot accept such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate such scoundrels. If we do not consider political parties and factions, the first thing to resist should be this kind of uncivilized behavior. From the moment you start sending friend requests on Facebook and posting joking posts, to trying to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude. You may continue to tag me at the frequency of six meals a day, and even continue to discuss about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, making some inappropriate and humiliating remarks about my appearance, figure, upbringing, what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed, and so on, I... have also had enough.

How did it come to pass that I received more than a dozen friend requests from various friends to upload a photo of you and post sexually suggestive remarks on your social media account? I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my report was uploaded, you did not show any sign of restraint, on the contrary, you became even more brazen. I don't care about your political background or your identity, in our society, mutual respect between the two sexes is required. Yes, you can continue with this kind of provocative, ambiguous, humiliating, and abusive language, you can continue to claim that you only care about and pay attention to me, you can even continue to deny that it's not your photo or continue to publish any attacking remarks.

Of course, I cannot and have no ability to stop you. I don't even know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need you to comment on them. I even don't believe that any woman would be willing to humiliate herself in exchange for fame. A friend asked me if I was okay, and I said yes, but you wouldn't believe it. I don't think any woman who has been subjected to such humiliation can still say she's okay. Whether in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who have no basic morality will choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice will be served. I have saved some of the comments for everyone to evaluate. You can't fake the comments you yourself posted, can you? I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.

长江干流实现水上绿色综合服务区全覆盖-新华网 新华社武汉12月11日电（记者王贤）重庆市涪陵水上绿色综合服务区10日如期建成投入运营，这是继8日四川省泸州水上绿色综合服务区挂牌运营后，长江上游正式运营的第2个水上绿色综合服务区。 至此，水上绿色综合服务区已覆盖长江上、中、下游。 交通运输部长江航务管理局副局长邱健华介绍说，此前，湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏等省份已在长江中游、下游建成运行10个水上绿色综合服务区，得到了广大船员的认可，为推进长江航运高质量发展发挥了重要作用。 水上绿色综合服务区全覆盖是长江绿色航运建设的又一里程碑事件，长江船舶污染物接收、航运服务能力得到显著提升。 据介绍，水上绿色综合服务区是为广大船舶、船员提供全方位生产、生活服务，帮助广大船员解决“急难愁盼”问题的重要设施。 此次建成运行的长江上游两处水上绿色综合服务区，集生活服务、生产服务和政务服务为一体，以绿色环保为主题，以船舶维修与船舶应急救援服务为特色，实现港内船舶“一次靠泊、多项服务 ” ， 将使得常年航行在长江的船员工作更高效、生活更便捷。

ASSISTANT: The Yangtze River's mainstream has realized the full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas. Xinhua Net, December 11, 2022. Chongqing's Wushan Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was completed and put into operation on the 10th, becoming the second water-based green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Yizhuang Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Chongqing was put into operation on the 8th. With this, water-based green integrated service areas have covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau's deputy director, Qi Junhua, introduced that before this, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 water-based green integrated service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were recognized by a wide range of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation. The full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas on the Yangtze River is another milestone event in the construction of green navigation on the Yangtze River, and it has significantly improved the reception of Yangtze River ship pollutants and the service capabilities of navigation. According to introductions, water-based green integrated service areas are an important facility for providing comprehensive production, life, and public services to ships and ship crews, helping ship crews solve the "urgent, difficult, and worried" problem. The two water-based green integrated service areas on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River that were put into operation this time are integrated with life, production, and public services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as the highlight, realizing "one-stop docking and multiple services" for inland ships, making it easier for ship crews to work and live on the Yangtze River.

ASSISTANT: The joint drill "Peaceful Relief-2021" between the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries has successfully concluded. All participating Chinese troops have safely returned to their base in Guangxi, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.

During this joint exercise, the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries focused on the topic of humanitarian medical relief and tightly adhered to their mission of guarding and treating the wounded. They completed joint command and control, on-site rescue, and mass treatment of casualties according to realistic standards, effectively enhancing their joint medical support capabilities.

The results of the exercise have been recognized by both countries' militaries. The director of the Vietnamese exercise guidance committee, the deputy chief of the Vietnamese Army Logistics Department, and Colonel Nguyen Hung Son said that through this exercise, Vietnamese doctors have learned about the organization and professional activities of Chinese doctors, as well as China's medical and support equipment. The results of the exercise demonstrate the professional capabilities of both countries' medical forces in medical assistance and epidemic prevention.

The Chinese guidance and coordination team leader and the deputy director of the Central Military Commission's Logistics Support Department said that this exercise was another innovative practice based on the successful holding of a joint triage activity in 2018, with significant milestone significance. During the exercise, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, and rapid nucleic acid testing equipment to the Vietnamese People's Army.
