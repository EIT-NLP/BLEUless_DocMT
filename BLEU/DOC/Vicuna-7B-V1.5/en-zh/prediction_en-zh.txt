Android hardware Cleaning tip Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers. They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles. I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions. After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair. After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood. After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device. And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions. There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction. Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work... They work very VERY well! After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new. *I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.

ASSISTANT: 安卓硬件清洁技巧细腻（0.3毫米-0.5毫米）干精密刷子非常适合清除那些微小的孔隙，这些孔隙里居住着你的智能设备麦克风和喇叭。这是一个价格便宜的产品，比较安全，而且不像使用洗涤酒精、牙刷、钉子和针子等其他方法那么危险。我最近就用了这种方法清除了我的三星Galaxy Watch 4 Classic上的麦克风孔，因为它在使用语音识别功能时无法识别我的声音。经过几个月的思考，我需要安排售后服务或预约维修。经过大量呼噜在电话通话中，以便我可以被听到和理解。经过制造商的建议，使用水印功能，重置设备并重新制造设备。在多次浏览互联网后，似乎没有保证任何满意的解决方案。然后我有了一个领悟，我尝试了细腻的刷子，它们...它们非常非常好地工作！经过几次用细腻但坚硬的毛刷插入设备，你的设备应该就像当它是新的一样工作。*我建议使用干精密刷子，并不接受任何后果，如果您决定使用任何清洁产品的任何组合。

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy. De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer. Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor. He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994. De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990. Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election. President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor. "He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees. I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him. A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers. Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions. Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer. De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority. Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police. The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security. Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid. In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing. De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss. The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier. The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow. All were wearing avalanche beacons. While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion. "Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest. They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour). The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall. The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters). "We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm. People got excited," DeBerry said. "We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk." Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

ASSISTANT: 在华盛顿州的一个滑雪度假胜地，一座冰川摧毁了一个滑雪度假胜地，导致一名60岁的男子死亡，并且暂时抓住了五名其他人。这起冰川发生在华盛顿州的Crystal Mountain的Silver Basin区域，这个区域位于Seattle以南85英里（137公里）处，Pierce County Sheriff's Department的Sgt. Darren Moss说。死者的身份尚未公布，但据报道，他在被抓出雪后呼吸停止，尽管另一名滑雪者尝试进行CPR。受困的其他滑雪者得到了两名目击者的帮助，他们被冰川推倒。所有人都戴着冰川信号器。尽管这些受困的人都是经验丰富的后园滑雪者，但警告禁止在该区域滑雪，这个区域位于Crystal Mountain滑雪度假胜地的边界内。私人滑雪度假胜地决定了冰川的状况，但没有什么可以阻止滑雪者去那里，因为该胜地与公共土地Mount Baker-Snoqualmie国家森林相邻。Crystal Mountain的总裁和首席执行官Frank DeBerry说，六名男子都持有滑雪度假胜地的上山旅行卡，这意味着他们注册了滑雪警察，参加了通过度假胜地的资源访问后园滑雪的方法和地点的指导，并且必须在他们的探险之前检查雪情。“滑雪者可以在国家森林中任何地方旅行。他们进入了森林，但最终回到了度假胜地的边界（Crystal Mountain），这里发生了这次冰川。” DeBerry说。除了关闭发生冰川的区域，度假胜地早上还关闭了Mt. Rainier摩托车，因为风速达到100英里每小时（161公里每小时）。这起冰川发生在季节的首次重大雪fall中。该区域处于一个持续到周日早晨的寒冷风暴警报下，国家气象局表示，高于2000英尺（610米）的地区可能会遇到12到15英寸（38厘米）的雪。“我们有一个晚季开始，现在我们从几乎没有雪变成了一个巨大的雪暴。人们很兴奋。我们

Hey r/Military! I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries. Hello everyone! I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force. Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29. You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60. In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year. However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission. If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such. I am just wondering how is it for other countries? If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country? What do you guys think about mandatory military service? During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada. Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military. I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well. Sorry for my poor grammar. English is my second language.

ASSISTANT: 你好 r/Military！我来自一个强制军事服役的国家，我只是想了解其他国家的情况。你好大家！我来自爱沙尼亚，在那里我是国家防御力量的一部分。在这里，军事服役是所有男性16-29岁的责任。你需要完成8个或11个月的训练，然后被派往“储备”部队，直到您60岁。在这段时间内，防御力量有资格要求您参加每年一次或两次的军事演习，每年大约2周。但是，您不被迫前往外国战争。如果您想要这样做，您必须加入“探险队”，成为一名职业军人，并享有薪水等福利。我只是想了解其他国家的情况。如果您在美国或英国等国家加入军队，您是否被迫参加另一国的战争？您们对强制军事服役有什么看法？在2018-2019年在托皮的训练期间，我们也有英国、美国、法国、比利时、丹麦和加拿大等国家的单位。不幸的是，我们并没有太多时间交流，也没有机会与那些人面对面询问他们在他们国家的军队服役情况。我知道，这个 subreddit 可能主要由 NATO 成员组成，但也很有趣听取来自其他（非 NATO）国家的意见。对于我的语法不佳，抱歉，英语是我的第二语言。

I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried. Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills. While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump, I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life. To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward. Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity. That's the thing. Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege. Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist. The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts. But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.

ASSISTANT: 我喜欢这种文章，它有助于揭示我父亲崇拜的复杂网络，其中包括社会病態的超级侵略者男人，以及他谴责的领袖多数。想象一下尼克松和卡特尔的位置，以及他的黄金孩子雷根可以做的一切坏事。虽然我已经知道很长时间，这种世界观是完全的垃圾，事实上我厌恶从凯撒到波拿巴，尼克逊，雷根，布什和特朗普这些社会病態的超级侵略者，但我可以欣赏凯撒或波拿巴的历史意义，但它们的纯洁历史的半神半人的性质让我对它们后来失去兴趣。到目前为止，我仍然不愿意研究波兰的历史，因为这样做只会让我父亲的疯狂谣言升腾。回到这篇文章，我喜欢那些小细节，它提醒你，尽管存在一个比较好的选择（尽管存在较小的缺陷，但主要是以良心为基础），而另一个方面是不好的，没有良心行为，并且恶意更有可能是坏意思而不是傻瓜。那就是事情。共和党人喜欢隐藏在傻瓜之后，而不是承认恶意，但不要忘记，如果一个政党的理论基础受到困境，那么偶然性、幸運等事件很少存在。被围困的心态意味着每一个行动都必须计入，否则你将浪费有限的能量在荒谬的行为上。但共和党人喜欢隐藏在我们对世界的更为细致的理解之后，试图抛弃各种哲学刀子。

Sunday Best: Enter 1880s New York in HBO's "The Gilded Age" Hat and parasol alert! "The Gilded Age," created by Julian Fellowes ("Downton Abbey") and written by Fellowes and Sonja Warfield, premieres next month on HBO. Set in 1880s New York, it follows Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson, above left) and aspiring writer Peggy Scott (Denée Benton, right) as they newly encounter old-money society. Also in the cast are Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector, among many more. Good fun for the winter, no? The costumes, which look to be quite lavish indeed, are designed by Kasia Walicka-Maimone, whose previous work includes "The Goldfinch," "A Quiet Place" and "Moonrise Kingdom."

Move the trailer! Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop. I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster. No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it. The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something. Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella. The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly). Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster? Me: No, the owner drove yesterday. Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster! Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it. Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there. You know we need to have access to the dumpster. Me: but I didn’t park it there. Why don’t you talk to the owner about it? Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah Me: It was not me. The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way. From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

ASSISTANT: 移动拖曳车！几年前，我在一家橱柜工厂工作过。我和老板一起去安装，当我们回来时，他停在垃圾桶附近的空地上的空拖曳车。没有特别的原因，就是那里有空闲的空间，所以他就停在那里。第二天我来到工作的时候，Jerry（不是他的真名）来到我身边看起来很生气。没有什么新鲜的事情，他总是有点抱怨的老人。对话大意如下（18年前，所以我记不住具体情况）。Jerry：你在垃圾桶附近停了那辆拖曳车吗？我：没有，昨天老板开车了。Jerry：你不能停那辆拖曳车在那里，否则我就无法到达垃圾桶！我：我不停在那里，老板停了，但我可以移动它。Jerry：我不知道为什么你会停那辆拖曳车在那里。你知道我们需要对垃圾桶有访问权吗？我：但我并没有停在那里。你可以和老板谈一谈吗？Jerry：哈哈哈你负责，这些年轻人没有尊重，哈哈哈你负责，哈哈哈……我：不是我。对话继续了几分钟，他一直批评我留下拖曳车的方式，虽然我并没有留下的方式。从那一天起，直到我在那家橱柜工厂工作了几年后，每当我晚上工作（这很少不是晚上工作），5x8辆拖曳车在工厂里时，我会把舌杆拿起来，把它拖到垃圾桶附近，让 Jerry 早上发现。

All our comics are sent bagged as standard. In addition, the older items are usually boarded as well. The newer items are bagged only. In addition to the above item, we have over 250,000 comics in stock, including both back issues and new items. All our comics are supplied from our real world store enabling us to offer a huge range of comics via auction. We've probably got what you're looking for! (If placing multiple orders, please request an invoice for the correct amount BEFORE paying.) This item is an original American comic and is in English! Please note that all our comics in every grade (EVEN POOR) will be complete unless stated otherwise in the listing! Please take the time to review both the attached cover scan and detailed grade description above to ensure that this particular comic is in the condition you require. Most of our listings offer Multi-Buy discounts. Usually starting at 3 or more items to gain the discount. The items can be ANY combination of ANY ITEMS included in the Multi-Buy. They DO NOT have to be multiple copies of the same item. Just pick the required total quantity and you'll automatically be given the discount on all of them! Some of our items include the option to place a best offer. If there is a Best Offer option, we'll consider any reasonable offer. We do not list ANY comics as Mint condition. In our view, this grade does not exist. Comic books are mass produced paper items, handled many times often with little care before even reaching the shop or newsstand to be offered for sale. EVERY COMIC, even a brand new one, will have some form of minor defect if you get out a magnifying glass and look closely enough. If you are intent on finding comic book perfection, or CGC guaranteed results, it would probably be best to view the comics in person at our store before bidding!

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist. Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said. Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene. A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest. A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes. We still don't know the reason he was killed. A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist. The whole community are shocked. May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents." Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager. Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him. This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances. There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible. We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us. I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why. It's the least Yahya's family deserve." Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10/12/21.

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me. When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause). Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”. I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car. A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental. None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle). None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim. They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage. Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department. I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction. If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

ASSISTANT: 一家位于加州的阿拉莫分店对我进行了类似的骗局。当我归还车辆时，代表发现车底下有划痕（我没有造成）。必须签署承认“损坏”。我也有视频和照片，但它们没有拍摄车底部。几周后，当我回到家时，我收到了一封信件，列举了一些我还要被收取的其他损坏，包括车门上的划痕，据说需要在我归还车辆后的几天内修复车尾。这些损坏对我来说都不可见（也不可见于我归还车辆时的代表），也没有在我归还车辆时拍摄到的照片中可见。因此，我争辩了这个要求。他们拒绝了争辩，并要求立即支付损坏的费用。由于这是一次工作旅行，我将我的照片交给了我们的法律部门。后来，我收到了阿拉莫的一封信件，说他们计划免除这些费用，以满足客户满意度。如果我没有在自己的身上，我确实会被迫支付这些损坏的费用，我相信这些损坏并没有发生在我护理车辆期间。

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions. This isn't even necessarily true. Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS. That's how most apps work now. > Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently. Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough? It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time? And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean? > This is in contrast to Google. Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share. I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps. That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

ASSISTANT: 脱链将需要他们确保其应用程序在所有不同的iOS版本上运行。这甚至不一定正确。只需将应用程序支持的iOS版本的极限设置为最新兼容的版本，并仅向具有最新兼容版本的iOS设备推送更新。这正是大多数应用程序现在的工作方式。> 此外，由于苹果可以频繁地发布iOS和macOS版本，不是什么问题吗？即使苹果提高了OS更新的频率以解决几个应用程序的小问题，为什么用户每次需要进行*完整的操作系统升级*呢？此外，“开发人员可以相信他们的补丁/功能将在新版本中推送”这句话的含义是什么呢？> 这与谷歌相反。谷歌必须脱链，因为在智能手机上有很多Android版本，每个版本都占据了很大的市场份额。我可以保证，如果智能手机上的Android版本一致如iOS，谷歌从未发布过这些应用的OS版本发布。这是一个夸张的说法，但无论如何，它仍然不能解释为什么将应用程序更新与操作系统更新捆绑起来是“更好”的开发者或终端用户。

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator. However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: 格鲁班的双重电力故障解释及其可能再次发生的原因

格鲁班的广播营地设置存在电力故障的风险，这些风险在下一届板球系列赛之前不太可能得到改善，因为板球管理机构正在等待更多有关格鲁班2032奥运会主场馆大规模升级的计划的细节。来源告诉《时代报》和《悉尼先驱报》，格鲁班是澳大利亚板球中唯一一个主要体育场馆，其地面电力供应不足以启动所需的广播车辆和设备，以在全球范围内传播图像。在第四天的格鲁班板球比赛期间，主要和备用发电机共同停电了约25分钟。这是因为基础电力区域需要为格鲁班的照明塔提供电力，其中一个照明塔在2019年大联盟比赛中著名地崩溃了。此外，板球场本身也需要供电。因此，广播人员从一个大型、使用柴油发动机驱动的备用发电机获得主要电力供应，而应该从备用发电机获得备用电力。然而，在板球比赛的第四天，主发电机故障与备用发电机故障同时发生，导致两者都停电，从而导致图像和DRS的全部或部分丢失。NEP公司，提供给Fox和Seven的外部广播车和其他设施的公司，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。所有用于板球比赛的其他场馆，包括阿德莱德大球场、墨尔本大球场、悉尼奥林匹克公园和博尔顿奥林匹克公园，将为广播人员提供主线电力作为主要供应，只有一台柴油发动机驱动的备用发电机。这种差异在过去曾引起Fox板球广播的很大担忧，但在板球比赛中，由于减少的制作和技术人员数量，这种差异进一步加剧了。板球澳大利亚被Fox警告，在技术上更安全地在其他地方举办比赛，但如果在格鲁班举办比赛，那么在昆士兰允许的薄弱团队中存在“潜在的风险”。

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop. My neighbors got a dog about three years ago. These neighbors and I share a fence. It separates our back yards. Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard. I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc. but this dog is insane. The maintenance guys are afraid of it. So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill. I can't even use my yard at this point. That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop. I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence. Owner says no. I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar. Owner says no. (Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.) Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan. I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*. Like, I saved and invested in this. Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker. There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked. When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up. My speaker shakes the table. It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together. The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays. Edit some grammar errors Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL. This can seriously harm and even kill an animal. Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested. It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit. It sounds great for the money, though. I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

ASSISTANT: 一只不停地吠叫的狗，以及我如何让他停止。我的邻居们三年前买了一只狗。我们分别有一排围树，将我们的后院隔开。这只狗会在我在后院里的时候咆哮和吠叫，并试图穿过围树咬伤我。我试图忽略它，轻轻地说话等等，但这只狗疯狂了。维护人员害怕它。所以我去做了邻里的事情，向他们请教如何让这只狗冷静下来。我现在连自己的院子都不能使用了。这只狗一直在外面过着整天，不停地咆哮和吠叫。我问我能不能通过围树给它健康的糖果。主人说不。我问我们能不能共同购买一把非刺激性的吠叫器。主人说不。（编辑说我至少三次向邻居请教帮助她的狗。）愤怒但不愿意打电话给动物管理部或者任何东西，我制定了一个计划。我买了一台非常漂亮的携带式扬声器，它很吵。就像我投资了一样，现在每次我去后院，我都会带上我的扬声器。这里没有白天噪音禁止规定，我检查了。当狗开始咆哮吠叫围树的事情，我的邻居（所有人）都能享受一些勃勃的哈姆雷特或腐烂的基督或其他不错的音乐，全部最大音量。我的扬声器摇动了桌子。邻居们很快就将两个和两个联系起来了。现在这只狗大多数时间都在室内，当它出门时，它很快或者主人和它一起出门。周围的社区现在都很安静了。编辑一些语法错误编辑再次：PSA 不要给狗任何类型的人类药物，如laxative或nyquil。这可能会伤害和甚至杀死动物。此外，这台扬声器是JYX公司的携带式PA系统，如果有人感兴趣，请告诉我。它仅售价不到200美元，但我很穷，所以我需要一些时间储蓄。虽然它的价格不错，但它的声音却很不错。我和我的邻居都很惊讶。

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list. You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag. A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality. A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance. Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available. Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow. Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one. Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole. The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number. The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood. To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip. Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners. External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying. Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used. Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area. Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering) Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use. Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort. This sleeping bag can be made extra long. Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation. Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe. We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of-the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life. Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop. Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry

ASSISTANT: 当谈到购买质量设备时，睡袋应该是首要考虑的。你可以削减各种设备的开支，但不能削减睡袋。你在野外睡袋或探险中大部分时间都会在你的睡袋里，而Snugpak可以保证质量。这是一款备受欢迎的英国制造的睡袋，它结合了微型包装大小和严格的性能。许多人认为Softie 12 Osprey是四季合成填充睡袋的最佳选择。自1987年以来，它一直是跟随其他品牌跟随的冬季包大小性能的标准。那些知道Softie 12 Osprey的人，其中有些人已经使用过它，还有一些人希望能够使用它。从苏格兰山脉的高处到雪洞的底部，Softie 12 Osprey就像我们其他睡袋在Softie原始系列中一样，被分配了NATO采购编号。睡袋顶部的刺绣裁剪、剪裁并适配有拉绳，就像一件外套帽子一样，可以拉进形状。为了防止两端纺织带或睡袋边缘撕裂，在纺织带后方缝制了一条“防撕带”。內對螺絲固定和挂袋标签提供内部标签以保持弹性袋的位置，与我们提供的弹性袋标签对齐。外部标签允许您轻松挂起袋子以进行风干和干燥。将袋子缩小到圆形脚部形成“胡萝卜”形状，温暖容易，并减少了使用的材料重量。很难在图片中看到，但一条纺织带从纺织带后方延伸到全长，以防止热量通过纺织带区域排出。购买两个左右手来制作双人睡袋（请在订购时检查），附带一个压缩填充袋，当袋子不在使用时可以让袋子变小。可以使用Snugpak Exanda面板制作更舒适的更宽敞的睡袋。这是一款单层睡袋，一层Softie

I was buying new tires. I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website. I printed out the page and took it to my local shop. It was part of a chain. The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout. Don’t know where he got the higher price from. Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout. He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price. He was gracious about it too. Been buying tires from them ever since.

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words. It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream. Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating. If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir. Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive. I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate). Shipping alone was approx. US$100. I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world. Finally, love your boards! Much respect.

This is the thing people don't get. The math doesn't say you can't get really sick if you're young and healthy. Maybe I'm a pessimist, but that's better than thinking you're invincible. That shit will get you killed. I think I took it seriously because I've been sick a lot, and I hate it. I'm healthy in general, but the flu always hits me very hard. I was scared that Covid was going to be worse. It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough. Still took months for my body to return to normal.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border. He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office. It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday. Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow. Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues. The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there. Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government. The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages. Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner. The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation. Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday. She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage. She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border. Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries. On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels. Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure. His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

ASSISTANT: 德国新总理奥拉夫·舒尔茨（Olaf Scholz）周日来到华沙与波兰总理马特维奇（Mateusz Morawiecki）谈论移民、能源、欧洲联盟事务以及东部边界附近的紧张局势。他在总理办公室前被莫拉维奇欢迎，并遭遇军事荣誉。这是舒尔茨最早的访问之一，他在上周三就与他的联合政府宣誓就职。波兰是对北欧气体管道（Nord Stream 2）的强烈反对者，认为这将直接将俄罗斯气体运送到德国，使欧洲依赖俄罗斯的供应，并暴露在伏尔加的压力之下。德国的监管机构已经暂停了对完成的管道的批准程序，因为存在法律问题。华沙政府还与欧盟执行机构（European Commission）发生紧张关系，因为该机构拒绝给波兰疫情复苏资金，因为该国政府的政策损害了那里的司法独立。舒尔茨和莫拉维奇还要讨论德国的新政府之间的复杂双边关系。尽管邻国友好关系仍然受到第二次世界的影响，尤其是在当前的右翼政府下，但舒尔茨的政府将继续与波兰保持对话和联系，因为波兰是欧盟东部边缘的重要成员国和德国的第五大贸易伙伴。这次访问是三十年来两国议会就良好邻里关系和友好合作协议的批准的日子。德国的新外交大臣安娜·勃朗特（Annalena Baerbock）上周五在华沙访问。她表示德国支持波兰，这个国家在东部边境上闭锁了难民，似乎被白俄罗斯政府鼓励，试图通过非法途径进入该国。她还呼吁对那些困在边境上的难民给予人道主义待遇。波兰和欧盟表示，白俄罗斯总统亚历山大·努科夫斯基（Alexander Lukashenko）的政府试图通过鼓励难民进入其国家，破坏欧盟的稳定。周五，舒尔茨在巴黎与法国总统奥朗德（Emmanuel Macron）会面，后来在布鲁塞尔与欧盟和北约官员会面。舒尔茨是一位中左翼政治家，在安格拉·默克尔（Angela Merkel）16年的任期结束后，成为德国

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays. On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13. These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets. I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it. How come we never saw the main shuttlebay? It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility. Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13. In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life. Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life. Couldn't they have done this on TNG? We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle. We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space. The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect." We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles. Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?

ASSISTANT: 《星际迷航》中的飞船舱 The **Enterprise-D** 是《星际迷航：下一代》中的一艘飞船，它有 **三** 个飞船舱。在节目中，我们总是看到飞船舱2和飞船舱3位于甲板12和甲板13。这两个飞船舱由一个可以容纳完整大小的飞船集装箱的全尺寸工作室模型代表。我一直很喜欢在节目中展示双胞胎飞船舱在船体中央、脖子或者你想要称之为什么的地方。为什么我们从未看到主飞船舱？它位于甲板3和4的主桥下方，应该是一个庞大的设施。而不是去那里，船桥船组会乘坐电梯一路下降到甲板13。在原版《星际迷航》中，为了给飞船舱带来生命，就建造了一个模型并用模型飞船和模型飞船舱一起使用。有时候，角色会站在飞船舱门口谈论，飞船舱模型和飞船一起叠加以给船体带来生命。为什么他们在TNG中不能这样做呢？我们在“最好的两个世界之间，第二部”中看到了沃尔夫和达塔在主飞船舱发射飞船，但飞船发射是从飞船内部看到的。我们只是看到了墙外的窗户，随着飞船冲出去，很快被宇宙所取代。我们只在“因果关系和效应”中看到了飞船舱在完整的大小中。我们看到了一个空气门打开，压缩了主飞船舱，然后我们很快地看到了内部以及几辆停放在飞船舱里的飞船。我有什么想法，为什么主飞船舱从这两个例外之外从未被看到呢？

I see it all the time in my line of work. And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating. Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life. Peer to peer failed. Insurance says it’s not medically necessary. We appeal. They say no again. We go to third party appeal. We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure. We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure. 24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No. Not medically necessary.” My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE! But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”. Of course, they don’t. And this kid is screwed. No other option. As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive. We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal. Not this time. The system is so broken.

ASSISTANT: 我经常在我的工作中看到这种情况。它甚至不必是生死关头才会让人感到沮丧。最近有一位患者需要一种特定的膝关节手术，以恢复正常行走并改善生活质量。同行医生协商失败。保险公司认为这种手术不是医学上的必要性。我们提出上诉。他们再次拒绝。我们去第三方上诉。我们提交了有关手术必要性的全部相关医学研究，甚至包括了一位不在我们的计划中的不同手术医生的第二次意见——是啊，他推荐这种手术。24小时后，他们再次打电话给我们，告诉我们“不是医学上的必要性”的最终结果。我的手术医生极度愤怒，说：“好吧，但你要告诉我哪种手术你会推荐，因为我不知道另一种会帮助这个孩子”。当然，他们不会。这个孩子被遗漏了。没有其他选择。事实上，这种手术通常被保险公司厌恶，因为它很昂贵。我们总是要战斗才能获得它，但通常在上诉后就会同意。这次不是。这个系统真的很破碎。

How was the farewell to Etho was like? First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife. I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P) Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right. Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone. I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak. With that out of the way >.<... So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day. Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc. While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history. Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial. How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts. Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such. Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things. Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms. This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me. What I am after is the other side of the picture? As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff. So how was the response from 'the old gang'? Did you keep doing stuff together? Did you slowly drift apart? Still chat or invite one another to events? Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats. Kinda the opposite. I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt. P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected. That's awesome as heck!

ASSISTANT: 关于Etho的告别如何？首先，让我快速澄清一下：我不是帐户用户，而是她的妻子。我有权使用这个帐户，因为我真的很糟糕用技术，这有点帮助我的心理健康问题（而且我看到了技术恐惧症者咨询关于红石巨人的幽默：P）。其次和更重要的澄清：我不希望引发剧情，也不想怀疑有什么不对劲。据我所知，只是风向发生了改变，不适合每个人。我只是一个老粉丝，满足了一种迷茫的渴望。现在说完了这一点 >.<... 我曾经是Mindcrack的巨大粉丝，从来没有错过GuudeBoulderfist的发布，爱上了协作，等等。在浏览一个随机的YouTube流量时，我找到了一个视频，详细介绍了Etho的频道历史。在结尾处，它提到了Mindcrack转向商业化。他如何看不着积极的方式，以及必然的拒绝签署相关合同。再次强调，不选择“专业化”或不想保持简单的不是错误决定，我知道人们有不同的方向和等等。快速的Google搜索引导我到这个老线程，显示了他的一面。主要是知道需要谨慎表达，但在表面上最显著的是，你看到了事情的不同光线，但总体上保持了良好的关系。这个整个故事发生在我自己走向其他事情之后，因此对我来说都很新鲜。我正在寻找的是另一个角度的故事？正如我所说，我的心理健康并不优秀，看到一个我曾经很依赖的小团队分道扬镳，没有任何普通的爆炸，这在极端分歧的公共讨论中很少见，对我来说可能会有一些好处。所以“老团队”的反应是怎样的？你们还在一起做事？渐渐离开？仍然聊天或邀请对方参加活动？再次强调，我不期望任何剧情，也不想看到人们争吵。相反，很可能。在某种程度上，这种低调的结束对我来说是一种小小的积极的东西，可以反映一下我自己心理上有些困难的屁股。P.S. 我不禁看到了您的慈善基金会筹款活动，以及您收集的巨大数量。这真的很棒！

It was prior to 2018. I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening. The counter people were the worst I have ever seen. A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here. I had a confirmed reservation went. After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off. I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away. I swore to never use Avis again. Worst car experience ever. National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me. Those two, followed by Enterprise. Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter. I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague. It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.

ASSISTANT: 在2018年之前，我被美国航空公司在弗吉尼亚州弗吉尼亚市（Philadelphia）降落，而不是直接带我去新泽西市（Newark），我和十二个其他人一起在晚上努力寻找车辆。柜台人员是我一生中最糟糕的之一。整条排队都在外面，他们在谈论一些与工作无关的废话，就像我们不在这里一样。我有一个确认的预订，但在等待一个小时后，我告诉她我预订的是什么，她大声地指责我欺骗她，并批评我。最终，我放弃了，走到赫蒂斯（Hertz）那里，他们让我付了很多钱，但他们立刻给我一辆车。我宣誓从此不再使用Avis。这是我生活中最糟糕的车辆体验。对我来说，国民航空公司和赫蒂斯总是是好的体验，而且比赫蒂斯更方便。赫蒂斯不是很糟糕，但没有像国民航空公司那样方便，我可以走上去选择车辆，驾车驶走，而不必在柜台等很长时间。我知道这些经历是匿名的，但我会尽力告诉每个人避免Avis，就像避免病毒一样。事实上，好的客户服务会让客户保持忠诚，而糟糕的客户体验会驱逐十倍多的客户机会。

The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months. France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year. The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough. Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests. "Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement. The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue. The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26." On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link. Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

ASSISTANT: 法国渔民威胁要破坏英国进口，以压力让伦敦给予更多渔业允许证，因为法国和英国之间的渔业争端已经持续了六个月。这个威胁是在英国同意给伦敦另外23个渔业允许证之后几个小时发出的，这些允许证旨在减轻两个邻国之间的紧张关系。法国正在寻求104个渔业允许证，以便其渔船在英国和欧洲海峡群岛水域中运作，这些允许证是在去年签署的《离开协议》中规定的。欧盟在去年12月10日之前要求伦敦给予法国渔业允许证，否则法国将采取欧洲法律行动。强调法国有权要求约80个更多的英国渔业允许证，一个代表布洛涅-sur-Mer和其他北海沿岸渔民的组织发表了一份声明。该组织表示，其成员感到“愤怒”和“被背叛”，因为英国只同意给予23个新的渔业允许证。该组织表示，渔民将继续进行抗议，“抗议将涉及英国进口”。该地区的CRPMEM渔业产业组织表示，这些抗议将遵循布列塔尼、诺曼底和北法国的港口堵塞，于2022年11月26日发生的事件。在那一天，法国渔船简单地在凡尔纳、圣马丹和欧克兰港的港口堵塞了渡轮和其他船只，同时也派遣了车辆来破坏尝试使用欧洲隧道铁路铁路的交通。自那以后，双方就此进行了几轮谈判，但尚未达成长久解决方案。

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought. I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither. After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help. Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want? >This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi. This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die. No, it's not. This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller. If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit. Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated. >At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong. We've already done this. Twice. It hasn't stopped them. And it's not like this is harmless. There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots. Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match. How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded? How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know? And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time? I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

ASSISTANT: 这些观点在面对任何批判性思维时都会萎缩。我不会否认有很多人不练习批判性思维，但无论如何，证明其错误并不能保证它会萎缩。在此之前，我们已经进行了一次法庭审查和手动重新计算这些选票，但这并没有帮助。应该继续允许他们“审计”选票直到他们获得所需的结果吗？
> 这是让Uri Geller试图推翻James Randi。这是故事的结束，谎言会死亡。不是。这是Uri Geller试图推翻James Randi，不满意结果，并聘请一家公司CEO声称他相信Geller的能力真实存在的公司“研究”他的能力并调查Randi是一个共产党员试图毁灭Geller。如果没有在这里产生任何结果，他们将要求另一次审计。或者他们可能会声称毁碎的选票被喂给鸡，然后被烧毁。

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries. Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations. "Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting. It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress. Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months. The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks. A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks. "The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks. Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance. Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies. Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported. The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord. The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

ASSISTANT: 时间很快耗尽了，德国外交部长在周六警告说，时间很快耗尽了找到一种方法重新恢复2015年世界势力和伊朗之间的核协议，在与G7国家外交部长进行会谈后。谈判已经在维也纳重新开始，双方正在尝试分析最新交流的进展，以确定谈判的成功可能性。“时间很快耗尽了”，德国外交部长Annalena Baerbock在英国利物浦向记者说。最近几天表明，我们没有任何进展。Baerbock表示，伊朗在谈判中重新恢复了一个延迟六个月的姿势。维也纳的当前谈判是在伊朗新总统，强硬反西方者Ebrahim Raisi五个月后的暂停之后重新开始的。昨天，美国官员表示，国务卿安东尼·布林肯在周五与来自英国、德国和法国的同事进行了一次“有效”的会议，讨论了伊朗谈判的前进方向。一名高级国务院官员表示，G7国家之间进行了一次“紧张”的对话，他们都一致地坚持对核谈判的立场。“声明也将强调获得伊朗重新加入谈判的可能性，并且我们认为可以达成协议，但时间很快耗尽，所以我们是一致的”，这位官员在匿名的情况下向记者透露。这位官员还表示，美国伊朗专员Robert Malley将在维也纳进行谈判。伊朗官员之前表示，他们仍然遵循着坚强的立场。在原始核协议（在2018年由当时总统唐纳德·特朗普放弃）中，伊朗限制了其核计划，以获得美国、欧盟和联合国的制裁减轻。西方担心该计划将用于制造武器，伊朗则否认。Raisi在周六表示，在维也纳进行的核谈判中，伊朗是认真的，据官方IRNA新闻社报道。由于伊朗拒绝与华盛顿直接接触，因此使用法国、英国、德国、俄罗斯和中国的外交官进行间接谈判。双方的目标是让双方重新遵守协议。预计G7会议将发表一份呼吁，要求伊朗缓和其核计划并抓住维也纳谈判的机会。

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club. Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday. It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground. Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday. The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool. Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat. Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results. Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed. Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

ASSISTANT: 阿斯顿维拉最新的英超联赛俱乐部受到新冠病毒爆发的影响。阿斯顿维拉成为了最新的英超联赛俱乐部，因为在俱乐部内发现了一些新冠病毒的积极检测结果。由于周日的训练营被取消，该训练营原本只是为了几名球员的恢复，因为他们在周六与利物浦的比赛中失利。目前并没有认为这是一个严重的爆发，据The Athletic报道，只有一名球员检测出了病毒阳性，其余的是训练基地的工作人员。阿斯顿维拉今晚将在苏格兰城的英超联赛中与洛杉矶进行比赛，目前没有认为这场比赛会被取消，而周一的训练也预计会按计划进行。尚未确认病毒积极检测的球员的身份，也未确认他们是否曾参与过与利物浦的比赛。曼联也在周日受到新冠病毒爆发的影响，似乎对这个情况感到更加担忧，因为红魔计划在周二前往布拉德福德的比赛现在被报道可能面临取消的风险。托特纳姆热刺已经在新冠病毒方面遭受了困难，他们周日的比赛延期了，因为八名球员和五名工作人员返回了积极检测结果。英冠俱乐部西布朗和Queens Park Rangers也受到了爆发的影响，QPR与谢尔菲特的比赛已被推迟。如果检测出新冠病毒的omicron变异株，那么需要进行10天的隔离，同样适用于与病毒积极检测结果相关联的任何人。

This is a different issue. Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop. It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone. Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be. We treat the disabled like crap. We treat the poor like crap. Everyone in the US should be ashamed. You're correct that our society needs to value human life more. If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down. We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths. Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on. Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS. I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people. It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world. "The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. "People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it." He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it. The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years. It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government. Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more. Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability. "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors. Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days. Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing. The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software. Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software. Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous. New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released. The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said. It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

ASSISTANT: 组织在高度警惕状态，因为技术人员紧急努力修复软件漏洞。一个广泛使用的软件工具中发现了一个严重的漏洞，该漏洞很快就被在游戏 Minecraft 中快速利用。这个漏洞快速成为全球组织的重大威胁。“网络正在大火，”Crowdstrike公司的智能分析副总裁Adam Meyers说。“人们纷纷尽快修复，”他说，“而且有各种各样的人纷纷尝试利用它。”他在星期五早上表示，自漏洞被披露以来，在12小时内，它已经被“完全武器化”，意味着黑客已经开发并分发了用于利用它的工具。这个漏洞可能是最近几年中最严重的计算机漏洞之一。它发现在一种在云服务器和企业软件中广泛使用的实用程序中，这个实用程序被广泛用于云服务器和企业软件。除非它得到修复，否则，黑客、间谍和编程新手都可以轻松地访问内部网络，从中窃取有价值的数据、植入恶意软件、删除关键信息等。现在，网络攻击被视为对金融稳定的最大威胁。“我觉得几乎没有一家公司不在风险范围内，”Cloudflare首席安全官Joe Sullivan说，Cloudflare提供保护网站免受恶意攻击的在线基础设施。数千万台服务器都安装了它，专家表示几天后才能知道后果。Amit Yoran，Tenable公司的首席执行官，称这个漏洞是“过去十年中最大、最关键的漏洞”——也可能是现代计算机历史上最大的漏洞。该漏洞被Apache软件基金会评为10分，这个基金会负责Apache软件的开发。任何拥有攻击工具的人都可以获得对未修复的计算机的完全访问权限。专家说，这个漏洞让攻击者轻松访问Web服务器——没有密码需要——这就是它的危险之处。新西兰的计算机紧急应急响应团队是第一个报告这个漏洞正在“在野外被积极利用”的机构之一，它在公开报道后几个小时发布了补丁。这个漏洞位于使用于运行网站和其他网络服务的开源Apache软件中，于2021年11月24日由中国科技巨头阿里巴巴报告给Apache软件基金会。它说，开发和发布修复措施需要两周时间。

Yep…we guys all have guns. Even babies. We all walk around with them like it’s the Wild West. I don’t even know where to begin here. You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo? A crack head is not a “professional mugger.” If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what? Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings. Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it’s not happening. WTF does this have to do with race?

There's a circularity to it... I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition. The math they do is just crazy. "We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness. I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth. Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper. The problem is that we sold out the people below us. I agree with you. Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better. Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

ASSISTANT: 有一种循环性...我认为快餐盒子是一个疯狂的提议。他们所做的数学是疯狂的。“我们实际上在省钱，因为我们不必出去买整瓶豆油来尝试亚洲烹饪...”疯狂。我认为在消费者空间，价格更低的商品在更低的利润范围内是唯一让任何一个不属于上层阶级的人体会薪资增长的原因。薪资并没有真正上升，但东西变得更便宜。问题在于我们把下面的人们出售了。我同意你。有些人需要至少放弃一些便利，以便让社会更好。即使我不属于那些会支付更高税款的收入层，我仍然可以购买一些更昂贵的东西，这些东西可以由获得合理工资的人制造，我可以愿意等待几天才得到它，这样一些承包人才不会被迫工作到骨瘦。

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus. So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers. But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view. My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic. Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance. On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not. What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child? I dread to think. I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing. For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right. It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020. AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven. Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants. The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization. POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests. Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology. The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants. The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily. As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19. This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed. Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials. The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

ASSISTANT: 分子诊断测试可以在20分钟内检测奥米茄变异株：报道韩国研究人员开发了分子诊断技术，可以检测奥米茄变异株。该技术的开发已经完成，但需要时间才能商业化。浦项科技大学（POSTECH）在10日公布，由化学工程系教授李仲武领导的研究团队开发了能够在20-30分钟内检测奥米茄变异株的分子诊断技术，并将在线发表结果。奥米茄是一种在病毒COVID-19中使用spike蛋白用于感染细胞的26-32个变异。据研究团队称，分子诊断技术可以区分单碱基的变异，因此可以检测“隐形奥米茄”，这些在PCR测试中很难被检测。目前，韩国疾病控制和预防中心使用三种方法来检测COVID-19变异株：全基因组分析、目标DNA（如spike蛋白等变异）分析和PCR测试。在德尔塔变异株的情况下，可以通过当前的PCR测试进行检测，但奥米茄不能。本次开发的技术不是阅读DNA或RNA序列的测序方法，而是分子诊断技术。现有技术仅对病毒的特定区域进行屏蔽，但分子诊断技术是设计用于在COVID-19RNA存在时产生核苷酸结合反应的，从而实现快速检测。据李教授称，奥米茄在PCR测试中具有强大的N基因信号，但弱的S基因信号。在“隐形奥米茄”的情况下，N和S基因都确认为积极，使其难以与其他变异株区分。分子诊断技术与PCR在不同的机制上工作，高效地检测奥米茄变异株。与传统技术一般处理的最多96个样品/设备不同，新技术可以在30分钟内处理超过125个样品（每小时超过250个样品）。此外，该技术不需要专用设备，因此可以简单地制备诊断套件。由于该方法可以在4天内开发诊断套

I told ya so.... The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization. Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was. Needless to say, it was chaos. At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was. I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks? straws?). Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7." Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off. Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there. A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not. He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8. I'll help you find them, ma'am." As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know". Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line. As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her." HA....told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue. My water heater is set pretty low. It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment). Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold. If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath? Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied? Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice! I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick. The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation. It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.

ASSISTANT: 水暖器温度和洗浴问题。我的水暖器设置得很低。它是一个小箱子里的水暖器（我住在一栋老破舊的公寓里）。问题是，它可以填满浴缸，而不会变冷。如果我每周只洗澡一次（但每两天洗澡），水暖器有足够的水可以快速洗澡，那么是否值得将温度提高，以便每周洗澡一次？还是我会节省更多的电力，在水暖器空箱后将烤锅上的水加入浴缸里？编辑：谢谢大家的建议！我只微微提高了温度，它确实解决了问题。关于煮沸是不高效的说法，可能是正确的，因为尽管水暖器一直在运行，但那个东西有如此多的隔热材料，让我留在那个温度上，并将其视为最终解决方案。

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only. The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth. I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules. The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course. If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online. Here is the course intro **CompTIA A+ Course Intro**

You know something. I get what Dave's point was. It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people. And of course that's true. But Dave forgot something. Many people who hate trans people also hate black people. He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter. He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric. He's given credibility to transphobia. And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence. He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him. How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.

A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee. So to note, I didn’t witness this. I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job. These two guys came to the store. One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law. After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it. This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door. Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid. When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him. I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle. I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on. But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set. He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

ASSISTANT: 一个窃贼的裤子在他尝试逃跑时落下。所以要注意的是，我并没有见证这件事。我在我的第一份零售工作中的同事们告诉我这个故事。有两个人来到商店。其中一个人因总是把法律陷入麻烦而在镇上著名。经过一段时间的浏览，著名的一个人离开了店铺，回到了他的车辆，而另一个人拿着一个购物车，里面放着一个五百美元的电压套。这个伙伴然后等待两个收款员在出口门口忙碌，然后轻轻地穿过他们，出门了。两个人都注意到了，并问对方是否付了钱。当确认他没有付钱时，其中一个人开始追赶他。我听说收款员呼喊他停下来，然后跟着他追赶，但他开始跑着购物车，去抢劫车。我不知道他是否喜欢穿低裤裤，或者没有戴带。但是我听说他的裤子开始落下，他在奔跑和拿着负重的电压套拖车时努力拉起裤子。然后他抛弃了购物车，留下了电压套在里面，然后迅速地拉起裤子，跑到抢劫车里，与他的著名伙伴一起跳进车辆。

I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past. If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs, we might be able to help! Depending on the company. I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by. I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately. I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course. Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!" We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed. Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services. These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons. It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps. Some gyms let you rent lockers. Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.

Amazing. But good on you. Yeah, when I was 16 I applied and got offered a job at a restaurant. Dishwasher. First shift they had me close. Saturday. We were working till past 1am. I quit the next day. Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that. Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot. They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row. He quit. Unless you advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose your workers if you hit them with it too early.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK. They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march. Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year. "All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram. Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it. An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers. UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it. It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade. The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council. The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse." Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city. The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march. A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states. "We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming. Everything," he said. "And obviously it has some impact here." At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm. The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history." He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate. "All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said. The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change. "As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle. "How are we going to handle this?" he continued. "Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen." Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution. "So we have to act," he said. Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms. "I promise you. Whatever is needed. Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said. He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government. "I want folks in all these states to know. We're going to get through this. We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said. "This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans." The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts. "I do plan on going," he said.

ASSISTANT: 乔·拜登哀悼无法阻止全球气温升高的失败 总统乔·拜登在周六晚上表示遗憾，指责世界未能阻止全球气温升高，这是在他发表演讲，探讨穿越几个州的致命龙卷风。“我们都知道，当气温升高时，一切都更加强烈。一切都是这样的。当然，它对这里有一定的影响。”至少有30个龙卷风在六个不同的州发生，导致广泛的破坏，预计有100多人死亡。总统表示，他不知道全球气温升高对这些致命龙卷风的贡献程度，但他描述这是历史上最大的龙卷风袭击之一。他表示，他会让环境保护署调查。“我只知道，气温升高对这些恶劣天气的贡献有什么影响，”拜登说。总统赞扬了报道者，询问他关于气候变化的问题。“如常，你总是提出最好的问题，”他用幽默的咳嗽回应。“我们该如何处理这个问题？”他继续说。“其中一部分是认识到，在继续行动解决全球气温升高的情况下，气候灾害的发生概率减少不会发生。”拜登表示，他被2021年国家的记录热带风暴惊吓了，表达担忧全球气温升高是主要贡献。“所以我们必须行动，”他说。拜登表示，第一步是保护生命，关心受灾家庭。“我保证你们，联邦政府会提供一切必要的帮助，”拜登说。他表示，他会密切关注龙卷风恢复工作，并且联邦政府会采取任何必要的措施。“我想让所有这些州的人都知道，我们一定会共同度过这个难关，联邦政府不会背离。这是一个时候，我们不是民主党人或共和党人，”拜登说。拜登表示，他计划访问受灾区域，只要不影响当地救援行动。“我打算去，”他说。

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018. "I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010. "Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series. Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography. Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died. Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

ASSISTANT: 《访问吸血鬼》作者安妮·雷伊斯在80岁时去世。她因脑损伤引起的并发症去世，克里斯托弗·雷伊斯说。雷伊斯最大的成功是1976年出版的首本小说《访问吸血鬼》，该小说介绍了吸血鬼列斯特（Lestat）这个角色，他将成为《吸血鬼历史》系列的13本书中的中心角色。最近的一本书是2018年出版的。“我有一个列斯特的想法，他是一个行动者，一个可以做我不能做的人”，雷伊斯在2010年在南伊利诺伊大学的一次演讲中说。《访问吸血鬼》于1994年成为一部成功的电影，帮助重新燃起了对吸血鬼类型的兴趣，这一兴趣继续在《吸血鬼日记》电视剧和《吸血鬼》电影系列中展现。虽然她大部分时间生活在加州，但雷伊斯出生于路易斯安那，并在她的网站生物传记中提到了她的许多故事就是在那里发生的。雷伊斯的儿子克里斯托弗·雷伊斯说，他在母亲去世时正在她的床邊。安妮·雷伊斯将在路易斯安那进行私人仪式，并计划在明年举行公共纪念活动，他说。

Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage. Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage. I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone. I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case. After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data. After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do. I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable. Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue. Have you experienced this as well?

ASSISTANT: 最近，我从iPhone 12 Pro转换到iPhone 13 Pro Max，在这两款手机上都注意到了一个占用我内部存储空间的bug。Apple Music的文档和数据使用了约35GB的内部存储。我尝试通过删除应用程序来纠正这个问题，但由于这是一个预置应用程序，所以文档和数据从iPhone永远不会真正删除。我认为，一旦我转移到新的iPhone 13 Pro，这个bug就会消失，但这并不是情况。在从iCloud备份中安装之后，我检查了Apple Music应用程序，发现它仍然使用超过30GB的文档和数据。在联系两名苹果支持专家时，一个人建议我清除iPhone并重新启动，另一个人没有提供实际的建议，因为这个问题超出了他们能够处理的范围。我还检查了我的iPad，发现在它上AM只使用了15GB的文档和数据，但这仍然不够接受。现在，我诉诸社区，看看这个问题是否广泛存在，并且希望能够引起苹果的关注。您是否也有经历过这个问题？

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2? Specifically 2.10 "Over" Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting. Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this? Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?" A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time. I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations. I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday. Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs. Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time. I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son. He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person! He clearly sucks at damage control. Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

ASSISTANT: 为什么 Skyler 和 Walt Jr. 在第二季的 2.10 集 "Over" 中对 Walt 在家里修缮感到愤怒呢？具体来说，Walt 替换了一个热水器，然后替换了一些看起来可能不一定就是腐烂的板材。为什么 Skyler 会这么生气呢？她已经完全失望了，竟然问：“你今天还要工作吗？”几周前，她一直非常热情地鼓励他休息并恢复健康，现在却对他在家里修缮感到愤怒。我知道她在婚姻中感到不满意，但 Walter Jr. 似乎微妙地感到困惑，完全无法理解 Walt 在家里做些什么。我也知道 Skyler 在希望 Ted 对她作为一个优先事项对待她，同时怀孕，而 Walt 自从他的 50 岁生日以来一直是关于自己。但是，在重播时，Sky 和 Jr. 似乎在很大程度上对 Walt 在家里做些有意义的事情感到非常愤怒，而不是睡觉或杀死人或制作毒品。他只是像家主一样对家庭进行维护和修缮，没有任何额外的时间。我也知道这只是另一种绝望，试图在婚姻和家庭人的角色上保持掌控权，尽管几天前迫使他的儿子喝酒。他明显试图通过增加一个不是立即优先事项的问题，使自己看起来像是一个做得很好，是一个很好的人！他显然很不擅长损害控制。无论如何，他的妻子和儿子的反应仍然让我觉得不对，感觉强制地试图突出 Walt 为了弥补丑陋错误而做的努力。

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups. It’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples. Ahmad Aubrey’s trial is also an example of positive impact. The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff. However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident. Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization. Transparency is the name of the game. Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country. When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder. Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.

ASSISTANT: 在某些社区中，教会提供了一个安全的地方，为一些受到迫害的社会群体提供了避难所。这并不是偶然的，民权运动与少数教堂、清真寺和寺庙非常紧密相连。阿赫马德·阿伯雷的审判也是积极影响的例子。西班牙教派也在做出正面贡献。然而，有什么是系统本身有很大问题的例子总是存在。宗教组织和机构应该普遍遵循与任何其他慈善组织相同的标准。透明度是游戏的名字。考虑到天主教会的案例，建议确保这些免税宗教组织获得的资金不会离开国家。当我想到宗教成员时，可能使用合作社区模型是有用的；每个成员都有一个投票权，作为利益相关者。希望他们至少为社会保险贡献。

I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive. When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!" thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what. I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover. Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down? They'd all have been killed. BUT if they were like "Keep working!" instead of "Take Shelter!", that's different. Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?

ASSISTANT: 我认为这是可能的（但我不知道）他们在告诉他们不安全驾驶。当龙卷风变得如此紧急时，天气预报员通常会这样做：“立即避难！”因为你不知道它会在两分钟或十分钟之内发生。我不知道他们有权力实际禁止人们离开，但我可以想象他们会告诉他们避难。可以想象那么多人在那个降落时努力离开停车场吗？他们都会死亡。但是，如果他们是“继续工作！”而不是“避难！”的话，那就不同了。任何人知道他们在工作还是避难吗？

Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned. I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300. But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not. If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all. It might just narrow your deficit that one day. An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though? That’s a no go. If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place. Maybe start with 300 deficit. Hope this helps!

ASSISTANT: 是的，这意味着当我进行锻炼时，我真的不在乎它燃烧了多少卡路里，我也不会因为燃烧了多少而改变我的数字或蛋白质。我（尝试）遵循1200-1300的标准。但是，如果我特别饥饿，是的，我会吃些东西来为身体提供燃料，并接受体重损失可能会一天慢一些，或者没有。如果你已经减少了500卡路里，一次难度大的肉类或甚至面包之后的锻炼会完全没有影响你的进展。一份薯片或冰淇淋的额外份量？不行。如果你因为锻炼而总是需要更多的食物，那么考虑不要在最开始就减少太多卡路里。也许可以从300卡路里的减损开始。希望这对你有所帮助！

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories. Not much to say here. The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly. I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them. “Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.” To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular. I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on? Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline? “Sure, OP. I am saving money to move.” This is really rare. My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever. Where is she moving? To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry. I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer! It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work. So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city. She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine. Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago. Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act. Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence. Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement. Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations. Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement." All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground. Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out. It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns. We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again. We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said. Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019. Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU. "We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure. The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said. Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.

ASSISTANT: 阿萨反CAA组织为抗议活动中死亡的人民举行了各种纪念活动。在过去两年中，阿萨的五名抗议者被杀害。几个阿萨的组织在本周末为在反CAA抗议中死亡的五名抗议者举行了各种纪念活动，并决定重新恢复对公民权力修正案的抗议。在抗议活动中死亡的Sam Stafford的住宅和Guwahati的一个足球场都举行了纪念活动，参与者决定再次加强对公民权力修正案的抗议。农民解放斗争委员会（KMSS）是在国会通过公民权力修正案后首先组织反CAA抗议的团体之一，在Sam Stafford的住宅举行了纪念活动。孟加拉国议会议员Akhil Gogoi，他在抗议中担任了农民解放斗争委员会的领导角色，在纪念照片上献上花束，表示政治党派和“民族主义组织”应该领导重新恢复抗议。评论2019年的艺术家群体，他说：“我们不能期望他们组织抗议。他们的帮助非常重要，但不应该因为他们没有重新恢复抗议而责备他们。”另一个关键参与者阿萨学生联合会（AASU）在Hatigaon Higher Secondary School的足球场举行了一个纪念活动。在这个活动上，AASU顾问办公室主任Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya说：“错误的是说反CAA运动已经死亡。由于2020年1月开始的考试，以及疫情和封锁，它失去了热度。我们将重新恢复抗议，并以全面的强度进行抗议。我们不会让这些牺牲浪费。”Bhattacharya说，反CAA抗议将再次成为一个整个东北地区的运动，就像2019年一样。歌手、音乐制作人Zubeen Garg，在2019年的抗议中担任了主要角色，也在AASU组织的活动上献上了纪念花。他说：“我们不会接受公民权力修正案，这是不可否认的。政府试图混淆我们，但我们不会让他们让我们接受它。”几个组织，包括AASU、东北学生组织（NESO）和阿萨国家议会（AJP）在12月11日观察“黑天”，以纪念国会通过公民权力修正案两年

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring Got just the one Christmas tree? Then you could be behind the times. This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring. More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol. Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia. Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours. Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself." British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites. Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees." Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more. Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep." Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber. Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response. In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state." He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era. "Christmas can be a pretty stressful time. A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things. That is always good for sleep."

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates. France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates. Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table... We also signed the contract with the Greeks. Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon." The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates. The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning. Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty." This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

ASSISTANT: 法国对于美国向希腊提供的驱逐舰产生了反应。法国国防部和希腊国防部都确认，美国提供的竞争性产品将不会影响已经签署和最终达成的价值数十亿美元的购买法国Belharra驱逐舰的协议。法国国防部在周六表示，已经与雅典签署了几天前的防务合同，之前美国国务院已经批准了美国驱逐舰的潜在出售。自我们开始与希腊进行谈判以来，美国的提议已经不再在讨论中。我们还与希腊签署了合同。希腊国防部也确认，与巴黎达成的协议是“最终”的，因为它已经在“最高层次”进行谈判，并由希腊首相基里亚科斯·米佐塔基斯个人宣布。据报道，最终化合同将很快通过希腊议会的批准。美国国防安全合作委员会在星期五表示，已经批准了价值690亿美元的四艘洛克希德·马丁驱逐舰以及一项价值250亿美元的升级希腊MEKO级驱逐舰的计划。这一公告引发了对雅典-巴黎协议的一些担忧，尤其是在2022年9月突然爆发的AUKUS联盟协议被推翻，没有任何预警的情况下。愤怒的巴黎指责华盛顿和堪培拉进行了“背叛”，而只有两周后，马克龙在与希腊首相共同发表声明，宣布将向雅典出售至少三艘法国战舰，价值约35亿美元，并表示“停止虚弱”，强调新协议是“欧洲的战略自主和主权的象征”。这一次，据法国军队称，美国“向我们警告说这个公告将会出台”，并且美国人据称“没有意向进一步出售他们的驱逐舰”。

Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders. I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question. I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc. I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question. He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping. He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily. I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone. I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it. He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away. How was I supposed to have known he needed help? He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite. This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help. He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.

Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation. Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings. Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power. There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow. Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported. A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall. Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital. Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency. The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes. Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road. Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said. Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow. The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas. An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning. Many roads were temporarily blocked by landslides in the south. Elsewhere in the northeast and southeast of the country, heavy snow has hampered or temporarily blocked traffic.

We had power go out a couple of times. Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately. They are security now. Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands). Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there. Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again. Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave. As well as every cart brought to the front. Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce. Step 6: Return said cold/produce. Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc. Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out. (Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go). It's really dark, even upfront. No way can we let customers just hang out. I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't. Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay. I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later. One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on. They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen. I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could. Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced. "We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic." He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE. The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy. "If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated. According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list. In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week. According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys. After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game. When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks. The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning. Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury. The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity. This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players. Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups. It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88). Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands. Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts. We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area. Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life' Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected. The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning. The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings. Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services. It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country. More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27. Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7. STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row. The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute. "Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said. A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland. "This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said. "It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime. For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."
