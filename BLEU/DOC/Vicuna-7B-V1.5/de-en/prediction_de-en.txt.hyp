The product cost less than 20 euros. The fee corresponds to 40% of the product value. As a #PRS\_ORG# large customer, it is not a problem for me. I just need a number or instruction on how to label the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I find this very annoying. Must I cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I find it generally unfair to expect children to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings. However, I do think it's good for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings to some extent. They can take turns keeping an eye on them, helping out, and even bringing them a drink, for example. This way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and feel included. As long as they are still capable of taking care of themselves, I don't see a problem with it. If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it's okay for him, that's fine. You can best assess whether it's suitable for your children. It's not like he has to take care of K2 all the time and stay with him until he falls asleep. Legally, it may be questionable. Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes into play. If something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether you want to take that risk is, of course, up to you :)
Please help me find the title of a book! I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't seem to remember the title anywhere. Maybe someone here knows something... The story was about fear and how to overcome it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going to his raptor enclosure. The case is taken over by a commissioner who soon becomes suspicious of his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear. The commissioner has a niece who also has a fear of fire and ends up at this therapist's clinic. It leads to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet. Anyway, it turns out that this therapist has a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and they are eventually forced to confront their fears in the most extreme way (a woman jumps out of a window, another one kills herself on purpose). This confrontation with fear is referred to in the book as "the fight." In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that involves a fire. That's the rough plot, and I'm pretty sure the book was written by a French author/authoress. If anyone knows this plot or can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN available. I have to contact my husband. But that could take a while. What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to receive a refund for the price difference?
Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail Child, four years old, has a splinter under the entire length of the thumb nail (outer side). We tried to remove it with a pincer. It was very difficult to grasp. It did not come out and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to remove it. No chance left. We will go to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of track width H0 and 0. LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker with a sound capsule assembly. Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder. He masters the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are just as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions. Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically report to a suitable digital central at full automatic. He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, the CV values on the main line can be read out with suitable centrals. For centrals that only program CVs from 1-255, there are helper registers. Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the Control Unit 6021. The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible centrals. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® brake sections just as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC System. Even braking with DCC brake stones or with direct current is possible. In addition, he also holds at a Selectrix® brake diode. A ABC pendulum train automation enables automatic switching between two stations. The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog Gleich- and Wechselstrombahnen.
After my voucher cannot be extended due to a complaint that has not arrived with me, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere where customer friendliness is higher and I don't have to waste my fingers just to reach nothing! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson will accelerate the vaccination campaign  Politics and science in the UK are dealing with the new Omikron cases. Therefore, all qualifying adults in England will receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Eve. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the COVID-19 booster vaccinations due to the rapidly increasing Omikron numbers than previously planned. Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening. So far, the target date was the end of January. The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as well. We are facing an emergency due to the Omikron variant, so it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, Johnson said. The good news is that the protection level can be increased with a third vaccination dose. "Let's boost now!" Johnson said. On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137. Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor of everyone using pronouns. I have sent in an application. Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email. I plan to respond to the email. However, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled him/her and depending on their cultural background, it could be either a man or a woman. **I don't know how to write the email now. Can someone please help me? ** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on anyone's toes. Conclusion: everyone should use pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them go. The one I bought today doesn't go.
It is obvious that the chair had an invisible defect when it was sold. How can a cushion defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS\_ORG#. That works but has not been possible for about 14 days now. Therefore, I have been buying the last books on the website and then reading them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have purchased 6 #PRS\_ORG# items, but I wanted to buy 8. However, there were none left. Now they are available again, and I would like to request that you add 2 chairs to my order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here. I just need to get something off my chest. As a 21-year-old, I come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons. An issue that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims cannot or do not want to seek help. I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect. But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations. I see the blue bruises, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in a private conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone. I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, even when I am close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence. I wish that all women knew that they did not have to accept violence. Often, I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. But it never gets easier. Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so unfathomably important.

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Disaster of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim At least youngster Johannes Patrick was left out. Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs." But that anger didn't subside after the game - it even increased due to the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone was enough to disappoint, the way the Riesen performed was even more disappointing. A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13%, 4 shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? John Patrick's answer was: "We weren't concentrated enough after our win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained." In other words, moving the ball. Sebastian Gleim, his opponent, had a completely different reaction: "It was a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like we were playing in front of 10,000 people." There were only 750 spectators in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made the most of it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. "The best playmaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim. Meanwhile, the performance leaders in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed on the entire court. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen avoid a total debacle and came within eight points of a comeback, after they had already trailed 39:59. Along with Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points. Luckily, there's not much time left to worry. The Riesen receive the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (7:19 pm), and even in Ludwigsburg, there will be a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had earlier a different email address, but I have changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself a few months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore contacted them again. We originally registered ourselves already half a year ago.
Always as smooth as an egg yolk: Max Raabe turns 59. He can charm his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear happiness." However, he actually wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. But nothing will come of it. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official order" to curb the spread of the corona virus. Other planned performances during the Advent season must also fall by the wayside, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de). The artists plan to make up the postponed dates from January 2020, when the pandemic forced them to move their concerts. Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen and has been singing a lot since his youth. He studied operatic singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester with fellow students in 1986. Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chanson in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded many prizes. His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached second place in the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013). He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream. Always elegantly dressed, with neatly combed blonde hair and attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer thinkable from the current German-speaking music scene. With the program "Good day, dear happiness," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance? It could be combined with existing furniture and so we could check if it matches in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only sew the cover, but I can't turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz (SPD): Expropriation does not create any new apartments The new Federal Minister of Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment corporations, as it has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin. "With expropriation, no single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years. A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations, for example, is actually the best protection against monopolization. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission, as with the results of the referendum. However, if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz has just spoken with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index. I will discuss this with the Justice Minister as soon as possible. If the rental market does not calm down, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process. Unfortunately, the product is no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock? Or if it will ever come again? #PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great! Then I'll solve it independently in the new order. Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut myself on the finger. That is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead in Kentucky due to tornadoes A powerful storm system has drawn numerous tornadoes across the United States. Alone in Kentucky, there could be more than 100 dead. The pictures from there look like a war zone. On the night of Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the US and may have demanded up to a hundred deaths. The storms leave a trail of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky. Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - everything was gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is hard to believe that this is even possible. He estimates that in the state of Kentucky alone there could be up to a hundred dead, the official numbers increase hourly.
Hello, I have just seen that Vitrine #NAME# is out of stock. That is very unfortunate. Is it still being produced? Or has it been completely removed from the catalog? Is there the possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when should you report? If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I returned an article through the contact form or submitted a return, and I would like to inquire if it has been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans while the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, Austrian companies have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial bonuses for getting vaccinated. This puts them in line with the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB) and the Economic Chamber, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination. The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is also intended to increase willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched companies where he was harassed. This does not improve his situation any better than yours. Waiting and drinking tea. It's been a year now. He has obviously not stuck at his old place and has been looking for something else. You should also do the same. And that he didn't find you good back then: well, he didn't find his job good either. There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation into account. That will then be legally relevant. I will take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign in Boron! I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure over the Dragon's Pass, and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players. We are playing DSA 5. The great bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out, and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes have to transport a wagon full of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea. There, the further plot will develop. A few miles from the village, the heroes are ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into an ambush. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, which also falls to the players. Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers armed. By the way, the goblins ambush the heroes in a narrow path and flank them to the left and right with bows armed, while two with spears stop the wagon. If a fight breaks out and the heroes lose, I have two solutions: 1. The heroes are all unconscious and are later found and healed by the village elder, a half-elf. The wagon is of course gone. 2. If defeat is unavoidable, the half-elf with two of his servants jumps in and helps the heroes in the fight. The wagon is still there, everything is fine. How appropriate do you find the Deus ex Machina solution 2? Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure? The goblin group will play a crucial role later, so it's not just cannon fodder.  Note: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely incorporate many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I have taken the lamp apart again. And put it back together. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Therefore, I would like to send it back anyway. Can you please let the return labels come? Then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

We have nothing to do with the toilet. Suddenly, there was a crack there. I was just sitting on it.
Here is the translation of the document from German to English:  The lower part was damaged, so basically the part with storage space. Will everything be taken away again or only the storage space part?
I am getting frustrated with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has gradually decreased, so I want to vent a bit in this post. Firstly, the transmission was abruptly interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the race were behind the schedule, Sky DE could have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision anyway. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it's still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race until the end. However, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding message

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and has not been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and have not received a response. The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second Lady told me yesterday that she would check her email and send it, but she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 2019. One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair). I would appreciate any support.
Fans are ideal for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filter system with an air lifter. This series is offered in three variants by us. Take a look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can see the performances in comparison. If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire systems with them. If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that more outflows can be connected. The MK series has 1, 2 or 4 outlets, depending on the model. Fans also offer themselves as an eye-catcher in the aquarium, for example with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with decorations that turn the air bubbles into a function. Here, a treasure chest, shell or similar would be named. The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise. The installation is very easy. The fan is connected to an outlet via an air hose 4/6 mm and can be used immediately. The fan should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan is mounted deeper than the water level, a backflow valve should be inserted between them. Cut the air hose and insert the valve. This would prevent water from flowing backward if the water level in the tank were to drop... If the fan is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy. Although we specify the processing time with 3 days on eBay, the packages are packed daily and picked up daily. Everything runs smoothly underway, it goes very quickly. We want to only warn a little, so that no one is annoyed, just because it takes a little longer sometimes. It would be so, not everyone understands the whole team of employees who also work in the shipping department... of course, here Corona doesn't stop either. Please don't evaluate immediately, just because the delivery has taken longer, that lies exclusively with the parcel services. Of course, one complains naturally about these services, even if we say at the moment... they have it really hard. This is also very regionally different. Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Is it also possible to order the legs in a bright color?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and moderator into space  The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers have embarked on a short trip to space. They were transported by the New Shepard rocket system of Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, on Saturday. The launch and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas. Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts back to Earth after their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, wearing a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule. Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers one by one climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were in space for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. How much each of them paid for their ticket was not disclosed by Blue Origin. Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced after the short flight about her father's mission. He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions. "I was just along for the ride," said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic. He would like to return to space again, said the moderator. "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers The New Shepard rocket system flies largely automatically. The capsule, which was separated from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again. The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned space flight by Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman. At the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became famous worldwide with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without consideration of the climate.
By clicking the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or cycle through its entire color palette. When faced with a color change, the light stone retains a light color for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp ensures that it lasts all year round in the open air. Even in snowy environments, its light shines particularly well - the only drawback is a shorter light duration when the days are shorter. Please note that in winter, snow should not be allowed to obstruct the solar module in its function. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary. You can order a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus further extend the operating life of your decorative lamp.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject itself quite interesting. Also, being in the lab does not bother me (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical course). I have, of course, also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely continue studying until my doctorate and become a researcher. However, at the moment, doubts are creeping in, particularly concerning the job prospects. On the one hand (Studycheck, etc.), one hears constantly how great the job prospects are and how the profession is highly sought after. On the other hand, one hears constantly about unemployed biologists and extremely poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really be interested in:  1. What do you currently work as? 2. Are you satisfied with your work/salary? 3. What have you studied/what training have you received? 4. Would you do it all again?  Thank you very much for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and training as a software developer. If you have any experiences to share, please write them down too :)
Extra Stress before Holiday and Festival Weekends  This topic came up last week with me. I had to use my long weekend to relax from it. That's why I'm posting this now. Not only before major holidays like Christmas break, but there is also a lot of stress at work before festival days and bridge days. It was like that last week: it was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in Switzerland. Most people and businesses take a half-official bridge day on Friday. So, last week, we had a long 4-day weekend. What was going on last week? Stress everywhere. Endless emails that had to be sent before the holiday, tasks here and there, everything *had* to be done before the long weekend. Because... well, because? Because "next week then" sounds so much after so much time and that shouldn't be the case? Or because the people are so serious in a shortened week that they want to accomplish as much as in a normal week? I wasn't just stressed on Wednesday, I was also really angry. What's the point of this self-sacrifice for holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly? The stress came, of course, not from above, the colleagues were all completely self-sufficient in this regard. My question is simple: are we the only ones like this? Is this our reformed-evangelical way? Or do you know it in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't even started shopping for gifts yet. "The beauty of it is, even if it doesn't snow in Erfurt, you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH. She will get into the holiday spirit by baking and stuffing plates with her son. "I love it," said Catterfeld. But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time, I haven't bought any gifts yet, I have to get started now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moulting and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg. NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage. The majority of feather damage that occurs in bird keeping is solely due to nutritional errors. Since the plumage is made up of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is necessary for the formation of a perfect feather coat. For proper metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly considered and balanced. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can be administered easily through the drinking water or through the soft food.
Thank you, I have found it. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are on their way. However, there was a problem with one of the parts. The middle bar is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on them. What should we do now? I cannot assemble the bed. The middle bar is held by two feet, but these feet are unfortunately defectively produced. The middle bar does not fit into the intended bracket. Therefore, I will receive new ones. When will they be sent? No, not flat ones. These are the right ones, according to the assembly instructions, they were only too narrow. But that's okay. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose. They are not flat at my place either. Could I receive these ones instead? Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential building fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria. Additionally, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation injuries on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not rule out a deliberate arson. The Fürstenfeldbruck Criminal Police has taken over the further investigations.
But then it comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo  Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin has published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network LinkedIn. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo on LinkedIn that shows him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus. In the social media, there were false rumors that he was not vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network. "For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors." He had previously refused to do so because the communication should not be about him. But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is struggling with a severe COVID-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks. The school friend and his family have not been vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask for the reasons. "The most common reason seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust." Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences. An interview on the Internet circulates with the Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated. "It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time. There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in Transformer Station: Thousands of People Without Power In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases, probably no heating either. A fire had disabled a transformer station. For 24 hours, thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district of North Rhine-Westphalia had to cope without power due to the fire at the transformer station. At 41,000 affected residents and residents in several communities, the lights went out. The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation until the widespread disturbance could be fully resolved on Saturday evening. Firefighters and helpers and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered places of care in schools and called for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and thanked the helpers for their efforts. We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions. We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring efforts," said the head of the primary technology area, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will take some days, as Westnetz technicians could only temporarily restore some of the cables. A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company's statements. Power is flowing again The fire that broke out on Friday at around 7:15 PM has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the transformer station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid. There are extensive cleaning and repair works needed there. At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created. With this bypass, the power supply is again available. Since Saturday at 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 21:30 PM. Since 23:15 PM, the last affected people have also had power. Over 80 Westnetz and partner company technicians were in action. The authorities had set up a temporary power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon and called for neighborhood help. "It is important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially older or lonely people, and inform the local fire departments if help is needed," explained district administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting. When setting up and operating emergency generators, the residents of nursing homes were in the focus. In addition, temporary care places were established in schools for those who could not take care of themselves or needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros? It is the daily cover #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the substructure on the tabletop. It's a custom #NAME#. There are three versions of it. We wanted to get the one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#, which has a diameter of 155cm.
Today, my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I cannot collapse it and thus shorten it. Can you help me further? Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise. I would appreciate a feedback.
"Yes, that's really easier! Then let's do it this way! Send me the return shipping label by email?"
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat. However, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG# before purchasing. Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost insulting. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic combined: Combiner Riiber wins The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää. The duo had to concede defeat again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping event.
Return of the order number #NUMBER# When will the money be refunded to my account?
Yes, we both have made some changes and are using version 4.5... it could be that they have already heard of the problem.
I have directly purchased a book from my #PRS_ORG# account, it seems to be included. However, when I try to open it, the message comes up, "Ups! This document cannot be opened." The file may be faulty, please report it to the customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file. Can they help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now what? I have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soap and water, rinse them with clear water, and let them dry. Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it's recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes on the later not visible inside of the parts or on a yogurt container. The first stroke on the part should be applied evenly, stroke by stroke. Light overlap of the color layers later creates a uniform surface. Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This can create unrealistic looking surfaces. A model is not a garden fence. Start with the light colors. The dark colors may otherwise show through later. Metallic tones and metallic colors should be applied last with a separate brush. Otherwise, metallic streaks may occur when they mix with regular colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you assemble them. The models achieve their true appearance through decals or peel-off images. From aircraft registration marks to ship names, trim strips, and license plates on automotive models: decals give the models the final touch. Place the decals in the correct order as long as the parts are still easy to reach. It's easier to glue the cockpit of an aircraft before it's installed in the fuselage. More important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpick are time, patience, and a steady hand when gluing. Cut out each required decal individually and lay it out for you. Decals are also called water-slide decals because you can moisten the back side of the decal with water until the carrier paper turns dark. Then you should only slide the decal a little bit from the paper and place it on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened). While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Note: Always check first if the decal is sitting correctly before you completely remove it from the paper, so it doesn't stick, wrinkle, or tear. Absorb any excess water with a household cloth. Note not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off. On Saturday, I already communicated with you once.
Can I receive this via email? Also for all 3 packages? Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages with me.
Thank you very much! Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned. Will I have no problem getting it back?
Childbirth Treatment with Insurance Companies / What is a "Insurance Case"? Hello everyone, we have been dealing with childbirth treatment for some time now, but when it comes to billing with insurance companies, it suddenly becomes an issue. One after another: We had applied for childbirth treatment in advance with the insurance company and were promised up to 3 attempts. The attempts were not in any way limited (e.g. time frame, success, etc.). The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the insurance company. Some time later, we tried for a second child and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but had not yet billed the insurance company for these. We reapplied for the cost coverage with the insurance company and were granted up to 3 more attempts. After several more attempts (we performed more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones are billed to the insurance company), we submitted the invoices to the insurance company and received the unexpected surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the insurance company only wants to reimburse 3 attempts. The justification: The remaining 2 attempts of the first promise fall with the pregnancy/birth. The second child wish is a new insurance case. However, according to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment is no longer necessary." Questions to the experts here: * Who is right, the insurance company (only 3 attempts will be reimbursed) or us (5 attempts should be reimbursed)? * Should the insurance company have pointed out to us that with a birth, the further attempts fall away? * Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child. It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Okay. We will no longer place orders with them. If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer. They can certainly pass this on to their manager. This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the return had been initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first. I can't do anything about it if the wardrobe is completely destroyed when it arrives at my place. Please see the screenshot of what the colleague wrote. It is clear and obvious that the return was initiated and I have not received a return via #PRS\_ORG# yet.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various pieces of furniture for our apartment through his account. We will no longer be doing that. No, the defect occurred after several months. A office chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they cannot sell it as an office chair. Independent of that, the warranty is 24 months.
No, I am not able to obtain a different type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company as is.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products promoted with additional hooks that we can unfortunately not find at your company? Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films  What exactly is a low-budget film? There is no general definition with precise budget limits. The Wikipedia has the following to say: > A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category? What appeals to you about them? And what perhaps doesn't appeal to you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully equipped two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable? Thank you very much. With friendly greetings. There is no phone number, a chat where one has to wait 30 minutes is not a chat! Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will soon give up again because it simply does not work here. Hello.
The EU can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime, but at a high cost, according to political expert Raphael Bossong. The costs are significant and involve massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus-Poland and Lithuania border, he told the Evangelical Press Service (epd). The EU has not sustainably resolved the conflict, according to Bossong, a researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP). The current state of stalemate - Belarus is not completely defeated, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The way people are treated at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong said. Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole is not determined to resist this, it goes at the expense of fundamental rights. This development weakens the cohesion in the Union. "She can apparently not assert herself when a member state insists on doing its own thing, as currently Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border guard agency, access to the border," Bossong said. Additionally, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the Belarus border, according to Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy will be difficult to achieve because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at crossing the border A Polish border guard spokeswoman said meanwhile that migrants had again attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus. 55 migrants were arrested and taken back to the border in the night from Sunday. The Polish border guards were reportedly attacked with stones by the migrants near the village of Czeremsza. According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers. Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so in the past months. The EU accuses Belarusian ruler Alexander Lukashenko of luring migrants to the EU with the prospect of entry. Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed border crossings. The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that transport migrants and refugees to the country. In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure. The most effective element of the EU's response, according to Bossong, was the pressure on the airlines. "The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard measures and extraterritorial sanctions." Minsk must also consider domestic political costs. The Belarusian society is probably not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly lets thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has filed a protest after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi. The Silver Arrows suspect Max Verstappen of committing two rule violations during the race. Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection. The Silver Arrows suspect Max Verstappen of committing two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest has been filed regarding an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, when he is said to have illegally overtaken. A second objection was filed against the classification at the end of the race. According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not compliant with the regulations. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and celebrated his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver occurred shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutchman had overtaken cars in front of him.
I am checking it. I will speak with the bank and thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag  The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park Stadium, home of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club Freiburg from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, to visit the park for free on this day. Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages. The roller coasters were lit up in the club's red and white colors on this day. Foxes, Ed the Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park. The collaboration between the Bundesliga team and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the early 90s. The partnership was once again demonstrated at the first SC Freiburg Fantag at the Europa-Park. Fans enjoying themselves together in the roller coasters confirm that the partnership is a good one, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

I submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and incorrect delivery of cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you need to correct and not all from our household. Contact Frau #NAME#. I cannot chat with them every day.
We talked yesterday and agreed that I/Frau #NAME# should receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return shipping label. I have not received this email yet. I would like to bring the package to #PRS\_ORG# today. Please contact me with friendly greetings.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything. That's like when a member of the AfD says they have nothing against foreigners. You can't deny it, but Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself from it, you should just let it be completely. Yes, well then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah. Who seriously questions the basic principles of evolution is completely lost. Maybe God created everything. But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense. And with that, you are a science denier and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically planar-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion and color aberrations up to the edge zone. Often, magnifying glasses are marked with enlargement values. However, these values only apply for exact conditions that rarely correspond to the usage conditions. To optimize the use of the magnifying glass, please note the information in the table "Technical Data" (see instruction manual in the packaging). On the surfaces of all optical devices - including telescopic lenses - reflections of light occur. By a anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. If the optimal usage conditions - magnifying glass close to the eye - are observed, reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the village of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations during the Christmas tree sale. Once a man had to drive home alone because he couldn't agree with his partner. He plants around 2,000 trees every year for the sale. The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations. According to him, this makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit funny.
And what about the coupon? Otherwise, I'll be a customer and leave?! At least, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it. Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both have their name. In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
Problems with Fiber Optic Cable + Devolo dLan/Magic  We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now. Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable Wi-Fi network. Before that, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo dLan, which worked flawlessly with a few exceptions, receiving and transmitting 50 Mbit. The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the dLan module connected to it, but these speeds are also reduced at the other dLan module, which is used to transmit Wi-Fi. The further I move away from this module with the device, the less speed I get (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module). This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than the dLan, but there were also similar losses here. Can someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optic cable? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely expensive to re-route LAN cables throughout the house. I am really at a loss, which is why I have created an account here. Therefore, I would be even more grateful for a response.
When is it time to change the checking account?  Who would have thought that now would be the time of rest for checking accounts? While many banks took advantage of the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with their customers using various tricks, the negative interest rates continue to decrease. The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now she has halved the limit and even quadrupled it for savings accounts. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank subsidiary - to 50,000 euros for checking and savings accounts and 25,000 euros for current accounts. But now these lower limits apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request. Not only for new contracts, but also for "individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already gone down to 50,000 euros previously, which still applies, as does the limit of 50,000 euros at ING Deutschland. The popular direct bank DKB has lowered the limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks have now set a limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to numbers from the Verivox internet portal. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which have already been successful in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation. Now, in the banks, it is being discussed whether the institutions might have to create reserves - in case the upper instances also declare negative interest rates to be generally inadmissible and millions of euros have to be repaid to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood. But her life is like a mountain and valley journey. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year. For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is mainly the result of much discipline and hard work. An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance. At least, so Aniston, she allows herself a single chip a day (yes, right: a single chip from the bag). That her heart still captures the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a miracle. Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the big love. And the desire for children has been removed from the list. Before, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother. That hurt her. The people who asked have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. It is hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it. After a driving error and a minor tire contact, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after only half the race distance. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, "The Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class. For his farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in a Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole, and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich Wins 60th World Cup Victory - Nolte Wins Two-Man Bob - Sport  The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot. "I've calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days of racing in Winterberg. First, he fended off an attack by Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, overtaking him from third to first. Then he made some changes to the equipment settings and posted a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday. With his teammates Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British Brad Hall. Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory. The Stuttgart-based Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner finished fifth after placing second earlier. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same," said Lochner.  Nolte Wins Home Race - Podium for Jamanka  At the women's event, Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bob on her home track. After finishing fourth in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory with her pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday. Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen finished second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. Jamanka also qualified for the Olympics with her performance, scoring her first podium finish this winter. Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig. "It was super cool to get my first podium in the World Cup," said Burghardt, emphasizing that it's not just about pushing, but there's also a lot to do around it. Jamanka was a bit frustrated with the not entirely flawless runs, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I can buy it now!!! What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay it either, which is why I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time to do so. And now it was said that it had expired, which made me very angry. Take a look at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently reduced :)
Why is the delivery only starting on March 16th? There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was was gestern von Ihrer Kollegin abgenommen. Warum ist das heute ein Problem Ich habe Ihnen auch Bilder von der falsch gelieferten Wäre geschickt.
But we still want the shelf module, it's just a new, undamaged one, and not the entire order canceled.
Only today, only this week, only until XY... Hello lovely girls and women, I have something I want to write and perhaps it will resonate with one or more of you... I am 24, have kPTBS, a full-time student, and a dog mom - setting aside the fact that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he is essentially my child. My best friend (since age 6) is sick, has a second-degree burn from Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice. I helped him with the shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to the burn). He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) which is very challenging for me with my needs for affection and love. My dog child has just had an upset stomach, I cooked for him and now he lies in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and stroked him. I live alone with my sister and mother, and my mother is currently away for a month. Now we have even more housework to do, which we naturally divide between us. But even cooking is a lot of work for me... My kPTBS illness is currently very well managed, I am almost fully treated and almost symptom-free. My university demands a lot of me right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything yet and tomorrow morning is anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit. And next week, I have an oral exam on Wednesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left. So, my week looks like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then what? Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the holidays. Only until the weekend. Only until... And so it goes on endlessly. I believe I am just so stressed that I need these mental milestones because otherwise, I'd pack it all in. Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't do it any other way... Do you also feel this way? Honestly, I am incredibly grateful that I don't have to work. Truly incredibly grateful, I can't even put it into words. I don't know if I would have made it with my kPTBS otherwise. I think that also has something to do with the mental load of women and therefore, I thought I would find fellow sufferers here... I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the entire color and surface is scratched and there is a table leg impression. With the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website. We are very disappointed!!!! What can you offer me? If I exchange the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26, #NUMBER#. Otherwise, it was sent twice. However, it was not confirmed.
What was completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is for them just another subject like math or geography. For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something. How do you feel about that? Maybe you can also tell stories from your work or study colleagues with different attitudes. Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate them. It also gives you a curriculum, etc. But wouldn't it be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity? What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? Culture preserve or something like that? I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?  Please write in English, I understand it well.  This has been going on for a long time, and I would prefer to avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a prompt response, at latest by the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a film from my childhood (I am 24 years old). I believe it is a film for youths. In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern world (real world). On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman. And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a plot develops. The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can continue to live, as far as I understand. The transition, I believe, is also the burial site of the soldier. At the end, both soldiers, I believe, fight against each other. If this helps, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept only on her stomach from Week 1. Fast forward: she's still alive:D Relax. So a child holds much more than one thinks. Make sure everything around is in order, no cuddly toys, go in often and look, but no minute surveillance. That drives you crazy! Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows. Oops, and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket. Observe your child when it sleeps. Can it turn its head to the side? Can it sit up from the stomach a bit? Or is it lying with its face forward directly on the mattress? You can tell from that whether everything is in order. We are also all grown up and when my man was born, it was already the fashion to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "Stammkunde" at your company and have already bought many articles. But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe. I kindly request you to contact me as soon as possible. The wardrobe is currently not usable in its current state.
To make it clear once and for all. RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV. But it's simply the case that the politics of this sender is now under everyone's nose. Practically every format is sponsored (ok), but then you still have to go on a big begging tour. It was said that one would be an "independent" internet sender. Quote Arno: "One doesn't want to be a running advertising column." What are we now? An 0815 advertising sender who tries to sell his Billomerch to the elite fan. And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne. They, of course, can continue to insult people. A Krogmann who lacks empathy and, at the expense of the action with the exploded rented rooms, tries to make a mess of it. How should one find all of this good? Well, if you like it, I find it terrible.
Please call me back, as my delivered wooden table is defective. The body of the table is broken due to the damaged delivery of the #PRS\_ORG#.
As a comfort blanket or simply for cuddling - My little warm friend is versatile in use. Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warm applications, as cherry kernels absorb heat very well and can be gently released again. The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven. The soft filling makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel comforted, even if they are not feeling well. The cherry kernel pillow with filling is suitable as a warm cushion exclusively for the following application areas: Before heating the pillow on unusual odors, stains or burn marks, check and dispose of them immediately if they are present. Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating in the microwave! In the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (as specified by the microwave manufacturer!). After heating, shake the heat evenly in the pillow! Then put the inner pillow back in the cover. At the first heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears at repeated applications. Always follow the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can lead to damage (fire and burn risk!). Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check in the manufacturer's usage instructions whether heating of corn products is allowed. After the heated inner pillow has been put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pillow on suitability for babies (maximum 43 °C) at the elbow joint! Do not use the pillow with acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood blisters, and open wounds, as well as with persons with reduced pain sensitivity. If you have existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes or tumor diseases or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use. If seams open and cherry kernels come loose, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessible to children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year, the temperature of the child during application should be regularly controlled to exclude overheating! All serious incidents that have occurred in connection with the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority of the country in which the user is domiciled. The cover is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in a machine. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the cellar. For Ingolstadt, it's also going poorly under the third coach. Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim trainer Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) wouldn't charge anymore when I plugged it into the charger. The charger I bought about 5 months ago should still work fine. I thought that a charger alone was enough to operate the laptop. Error message: the battery is empty and the laptop doesn't start up anymore even with the charger plugged in. Therefore, I disassembled the battery, but nothing happened there either. Maybe you have some ideas? I've ordered a new battery, but why can't I use the laptop in battery mode? Is there something else broken? Thank you very much for your help!
I would like to book the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to the room. How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat height is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? The Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design is the solution! With a capacity of 20 liters, it can easily accommodate larger photography equipment without any problems, thanks to the padded FlexFold dividers that securely organize them. And what you need in everyday objects is also well organized and easily accessible in the individually configurable interior, separate from the photography equipment. With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to Version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design is known by word of mouth - with the Peak Design Everyday Backpack series, some highly innovative solutions have been developed that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and provide quick access to the photography equipment in just a few seconds. This works with two options: once conventionally with the flap closure, which can be secured with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags. There is a closure hook made of metal with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, securely riveted, into which the closure hook can be inserted. If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar. If it is rather empty, take a deeper one. The closure hook and the bar are also magnetically attached. This allows the backpack to be reliably closed without having to insert the hook. The second option also distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photography backpacks: in addition to the flap closure, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: if you not only take your photography equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage, you can individually configure the interior (more on this below) and so easily separate the photography equipment from the everyday objects - and through the two side openings, you can also access it independently. This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards the body to access, for example, the equipment in the right compartment, while the everyday objects remain safely in the left backpack half and do not interfere. Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help. And since the outer shell of the backpack is completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents remain dry even when it rains in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# announced to me yesterday an email of confirmation for the assignment of the contact person by the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table. So far, I have not received any message. I request immediate processing. I am already writing with the third support employee, with none of whom I got further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation. It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#.
It is clear when the wardrobe could be delivered again? Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. Have a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture item and not returned it. And I couldn't have known that the past year would turn out differently than expected, and I couldn't timely redeem and clarify it. But I cannot accept the damage as a customer.
Rotating brake rotors are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to assess reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions. Rotating brake rotors are manufactured by casting and then machined (bored and cut). All tuned rotors are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain rotors and patterns. Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that aligns with the enlargement of the rotor after the properties of the original mounting. The thus produced tuned rotors ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness. Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the rotor, while the slots improve the cleaning of the brake rotors and brake pads. The aesthetic properties of our tuned rotors emphasize the attractive and striking appearance of each car, highlighting the character of each vehicle.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country. Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth. For many, it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build companies. You will also have the opportunity to explore the nearby river courses and adjacent areas. You are not alone - other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must outdo your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them. Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win. You choose your actions simultaneously and must manage your resources while building a tableau that works for you (known as "engine building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage. With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments. Coloma lasts for three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year California became an official state). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds. During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their selection is revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock! This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunmen. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return. The price changer turns at the beginning of each round to a new location, changing the available actions. This continues until the price changer has moved five times, so each location has been revealed once, and the year ends. There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from angry bandits. If the players have enough gunmen and have the bandits outnumbered, they receive rewards. If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the cemetery. The game ends after the third shootout, and the final score is tallied. The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm the shipping method, parcel (games included). For everything else, it is usually DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games included, wrapped in paper and packed in cardboard). If you are a collector, I can send it for an additional fee of 2 euros in a cardboard box that ensures 100% no dents.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it. >The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about upbringing. Former patients and those responsible for upbringing now raise serious accusations against him. Please beware, the film is difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. We parents and others responsible must never, never, never have power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation. Brrr, I still get goosebumps.
Holetschek: Countries advise on removal of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide removal of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting. "We countries need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing requirement can fall for those who are triple-vaccinated," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag". The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive to be vaccinated," said Holetschek. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already on Tuesday. - AFP
Also, ich will die Lampe zurückschicken. Wie gehe ich da am besten vor?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I cannot see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS\_ORG# account. Error message: Oops, an error has occurred. Purchases can still be made through the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer. I have updated my account details. What could be the problem?
What you describe is called *Awareness*, which refers to sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. These occur with an incidence of approximately 1 in 1000. The most common type is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images less frequently, and the least common is the perception of pain. For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased incidence of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the birth to protect the child. Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk. **EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine describes Awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex, by definition, had none. I misunderstood their comment.**
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20 euros do not help either. These are legal warranty claims. The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair. This is not only a legal obligation, but also a standard in the eCommerce area. Please check again if you can at least take back the defective chair. We will then sell the second chair privately. This will also cost us a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to. Once again, the question. In the order and on the invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The carrier is company #NAME#. I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS\_ORG#. Is that so? If so, I must cancel the order because I do not know a person who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor. Will I be called? I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an intendant. Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97. There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older." The shattering diary of a slow farewell from the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021. And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby testify to my gratitude for life."
There are different types of palettes. One of the most common is the European pallet, standardized wooden palettes that are mainly used as a loading carrier in the European region. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL. According to data from the Austrian Statistical Office, about ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020. The production value was around 79 million euros. It is not recorded how many palettes are imported into Austria annually.
New York has won the MLS championship for the first time. New York City FC has won the title in the Major League Soccer for the first time.

In the Eastern Conference final, New York had defeated Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Rolled Meat Tips & Tricks  I received some great tips for the perfect goulash a week ago. It was served at Christmas and was incredibly delicious and buttery! Thank you again for that :) Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time. I will set a beef broth for it tomorrow. Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What about the books, or how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can manage.
The letter is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made. However, the money has not yet been received by me. Could you please check that?
Where in the Lübeck area there is still Christmas brat left For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts. Have you not yet bought any poultry? Now is the time running out. We reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas brat in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME-, GAIN-, and MASTER VOLUME-controls, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the distortion on the other hand. Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL-control, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "gain" and distortion. As mentioned earlier, you can even create a power reserve with the POWER LEVEL-control, if it gets too loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-control, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation. The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even with headphones or direct recordings. An AUX-input can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so that you can jam to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuner. If you buy the VFS5 foot switch, you can also call up the sounds comfortably by foot, switch the effects blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects "tap". For live use, this is actually indispensable. With its new power packages, VOX takes another step towards the future!
But have you seen it like this with others? Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back? Since it is too low hanging for over a dining table? So I would like to send it back then. Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe? Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a legacy or gift certificate. Under certain circumstances, I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture. However, I don't think it's worth more than 1,000 euros for the items I don't need.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a Premium customer status at your company?
Iran is making progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement. According to Iranian statements, progress is being made in the talks on the revival of the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator, Ali Bagheri, to the news agency IRNA on Sunday. This is a "positive and important development," because at the beginning, there was no agreement even on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement were resumed on Thursday after a break of almost a week. The negotiations involve representatives from Iran, Germany, the UK, China, France, and Russia, as well as a US delegation, although they are only indirectly involved in the talks.
Thuringia has surpassed Saxony - the free state is now the federal state with the highest Corona incidence. Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country. As the only federal state, the value is above 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had an incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which has always shown the highest incidence rate in the country, the value was 990.5 on Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly lower, but still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within one day. 200 people with severe Covid-19 were being intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday. On weekends, there may be reporting delays. Additionally, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is not expected until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the post office, that's it or? here I don't have to do anything else click/enter/fill out anything?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to request that the return be at my own expense. An 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, audacious.
It's time for changes ###Welcome to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day! #What's the purpose of this post? If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the Bundestag, you can conclude one thing: it doesn't exist. We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer break for a few months. #Where lies the problem? Yes, what was the cause? Basically, it's about dissatisfaction with how things have gone here and how we generally stink. In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many here are still really keen on the Bundestag. #What we have to change At this point, the community around the Bundestag has been asked which one wants to keep it alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of rubble. After some back and forth, several people from the community have been found who want to rebuild the project. However, I would also like to expressly invite everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future. We have therefore created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server via this link. Goals: * How should the Bundestag function in the future? * Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we appear externally in the future? * How should new members be recruited? * How do we create a fair voting system? I am quite sure that I have forgotten something, but that's not so bad, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let's democratically decide the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/clumsy for it and is not suitable for my taste. For this, I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I combined it and noticed this when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund. This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the daily agenda #PRS\_ORG# also come in a larger size, for example 240/240?
PRS\_ORG must be able to guarantee that the defective cabinet will be collected promptly. And I ask you to arrange for this now. I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with PRS\_ORG how this can work. PRS\_ORG can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for the assembly? How much time would I have to obtain it or make a decision about returning it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I like. She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely. I myself was a vegetarian for several years. When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that I had long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually reflected and understood that I was supporting animal cruelty with it. Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction arose on her side, she then defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering. Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"? How do you answer the question? Do you feel that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without trying to address it? It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is not a clear exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am available on the assigned date, but #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return beforehand at the designated location. Unfortunately, this cannot be changed due to my absence for a funeral. Can you please assign an alternative pickup time for me? I will be consistently available starting on 01.02.#NUMBER#.
Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue Equipped: 45,000 Euro Grant from the State Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a funding decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros. It is a good and important investment in security. I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Lahnstein Mayor Peter Labonte. The vehicle will be used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate. They carry out tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance both on and under water. In Lahnstein, one expects permanent increases in deployments: The boom of tourist shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed the recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work. I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time, and now I hope for help.
Okay, so ist es. Ich würde gerne 3 Artikel aus der Kollektion von #PRS\_ORG# zu Juni bestellen wollen. Kann ich im Bestellvorgang einen Termin eingeben?

Thank you first of all for being here and for taking the whole thing seriously. I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, i.e. we were both weapon carriers in the executive branch. I don't want to go into it any further! The question of right and left always seems to me to be oversimplified. Generally speaking, one should say that state employees are more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be obvious to everyone. Of course, there are also uniformed and weapon-carrying people who are attracted to the right of conservatism, but it should also be obvious that these people have a hard time dealing with reality, especially since you also have, besides the average white person, now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and also homosexuals (and I now mean not the exaggerated stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and I also have to rely on these people, because in the worst case they can save your life or set something up for you. But even these marginal groups, according to my experience, have a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less abused by overblown left-wing politics, even if these policies are supposedly supposed to help them or make them right, they just want to be treated normally. Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wing views there, but they are openly allowed to express their opinions or even openly plan any state-threatening plans in the media, which is completely exaggerated and annoys me. Of course, it can also happen that even police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, start to generalize and also say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. Also, it can happen that right-wing-minded friends meet who engage in lively discussion. Nevertheless, such things are fiercely combated and countered with political education and enlightenment! Germany is so internationally entangled that it is also good in my opinion that we cannot have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side. Why should this come from England? When I ordered, it was not sold out. I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer deliverable. I have previously chatted with #NAME# about it. Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket also available in Germany somewhere. I always only find you as a partner company.
But there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part, which are filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with this issue for a long time. I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but I have never been able to permanently keep my household clean and tidy. There are always phases in which everything stays lying around, and sometimes it catches me and I tidy up and clean. But it's basically never the case that someone could spontaneously drop by. My husband (unfortunately) is also not better at it, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly housekeeping simply loses out to work and laziness. The kitchen is still being cleaned the most regularly since we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with children? We haven't had any yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupying me for a long time. Because for me, I don't have any motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as long as no one comes and there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable. Do you have a greater motivation with children or do you remain sloppy? I'm looking forward to your answers.

Career in social work - as someone with a personality disorder? I have completed an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been out of work for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting over and studying social work. The problem: I have a personality disorder (avoidant personality disorder, APD). This means, in simple terms, that I do not have a sense of self-worth and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for me to engage in casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as aloof (which I believe has improved somewhat). Can I become a social worker? I do not want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support. However, it is difficult to find out what the actual working day is like and it is difficult to find something on the internet. APD is already causing problems in my job now (for me, emotionally) because it always brings me down when there is something to criticize in my code ("just simple things go wrong again") and it is difficult for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how to do this by now"/ "he is holding me back with my stupid questions"/ "he must think I am incompetent" etc.). These problems are likely to occur in any profession, but I wanted to mention them here.
Have you already received the sofa? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I'm waiting for an appointment for pickup. What do you mean by "returning please"?
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, does the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book" appear?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein (Eiweiß) taken up with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual amino acids (Eiweißbaustoffe) and builds again its own protein substances (Eiweißstoffe) which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high strain for the entire animal. Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it may cause disruptions in the breeding cycle. After the short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily supply of vitamins with NEKTON-S (Multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (Mineral preparation) should be resumed.

It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily. A teaspoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regeneration is visible. Then the normal dose is administered until feather regeneration is fully completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break down after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged when it arrived and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem. A walnut tree is to be felled on our property. Therefore, a felling application was made to the community. A worker writes me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut is not part of the bylaws. However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaws. Can I now rely on the statement of the worker or not? On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the bylaws are clear. I thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message. Well, then I still have a sofa without use. Could you offer me a discount or a coupon? What were they more expensive?
Yes, I believe so. The question is whether I can pay in euros and have the deed delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Emergency Report: Serious Traffic Accident in Selb A serious traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the exit ramp Selb-Nord and Plößberg. As currently reported by the police press alert (14:03 Uhr), a car came into the opposite lane while overtaking. There are injured people.
Okay, I understand. Thank you again that it was so easy!
Happy Christmas to you all! Unfortunately, my Christmas is quite mediocre this year because my dear head is currently pondering everything that can be pondered. Before I get carried away... briefly: I need advice and, ideally, from people who somehow understand my situation - so from you. I am currently in the process of retraining as a quereinsteiger. Originally, I studied something else and worked in that area (at least a little bit anonymously, I won't go into details here). The whole thing was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun. Eventually, I ended up in teacher training and was sure that was it - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that was of no concern to me. I am now at the third "I Google other job advertisements" stage. And it's been half a year already. In the meantime, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the Ref, after which I can always switch again. But now I am absolutely done. I have had so little free time this month that I am completely exhausted. Now there are still holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me. Before the Ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekends were also my weekends and my breaks were my breaks. I had free time. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now the family celebration is too much stress for me. And then there are these rigid structures that stress me even more. Overall, it's fun and, viewed from the outside, the Ref is running well in terms of feedback and so on. But I am completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already. I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had free time when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, it was appropriate and I worked together as a team and not as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now. But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place in a year's time as I am now and unhappy. You can see that it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps you as outsiders have advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation that I am completely exhausted and, at the smallest thought of it, start to feel like crying. I won't make any decisions now, emotionally speaking, that probably won't lead to anything good. But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and I apologize for the weepy tone of my message. I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which partly relies on real analog circuits because these are better at capturing the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers also offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow. With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined it. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to also meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also highly adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable Velcro closure components, it is tailored to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens. A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a spare flash. Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for additional lenses. Additionally, you can still store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items. Even drone pilots make a good choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history? In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island of La Palma have caused great damage. Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island. Previously, the eruption of the Volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island before the west coast of Africa. No reliable data are available on earlier eruptions. The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make a forecast as to when it might end. The indicators point towards a slowdown. The best news is that they are stable, said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE. Damage in millions of euros In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the more than 1,000 degree Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava. That corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields. More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at over 900 million euros. Before the coast, two new land masses were created by solidified lava with an area of approximately 50 hectares. The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly rely, was particularly affected. 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely impacted, as reported by the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the Gifts of Christmas Christmas is at the door, and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive quality combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the sparkling tension. Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still holds our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss is a peace-promoting "social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and can be filled with life again in the context of this tradition. As it were, from St. Nicholas the Christ Child was born Strictly speaking, it were the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked with the act of giving. Before that, gifts were exchanged on the one or other occasion on St. Nicholas' Day. The background to this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women at night to spare them from sin. From this unconventional form of giving arose the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with gifts. Protestants reject this custom because they reject the role of "intermediaries between God and humans" as "holy veneration." For this reason, they are against the institution. Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition line. The focus of giving shifted with that to the Holy Evening. Since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only annoys a few people that the custom of St. Nicholas is similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and Martin's procession, which is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas time. Today, one finds everything from socks to coveted luxury watches in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, what one's heart desires. Variety of traditions in Christian countries proves a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day. With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to the Holy Evening. In all Christian countries, there is a joyful confusion about the question of who now brings the gifts to the children. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on the Holy Evening or the Christmas man, who in principle is a kind of Nicholas, is the one who brings the gifts. To this belong, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, the Holy Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas Day. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy the witch Befana is said to have shown the way to the Jesus child. In Scandinavia, sometimes fairy creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia it was Väterchen Frost that brought some fame. Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh of the Troika. In Czechia, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is the Christ Child who is responsible for delivering the gifts.

I have been trying to get a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# for the past week and today morning. I was told that one would be sent to me. However, I have not received any yet (even in the SPAM folder). Therefore, I would like to inquire how long this usually takes. Thank you very much.
Police shot dead suspected bank robber near Buckingham Palace In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace in London, a heavily armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday. The police announced that callers had reported a man armed with a weapon had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop. The man fled according to government statements in a vehicle that was later stopped by police. Shots were fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene. The police did not consider a terrorist background. There are several messages in the area around the Kensington Palace. The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area, or stone garden. The light is simply placed and can be anchored to the ground with two stakes. An integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery. Maximum light duration of 10 hours - the robust plastic housing is year-round usable in outdoor areas. In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually ominous objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with color. However, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: the sun ensures that this solar light fascinates - either in white or colored light (in a total of six different color tones). The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: like a large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day. Its organic rounded shapes fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the stone garden. It also makes a good impression in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where it can assert itself due to its size. You can save a lot of work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" requires neither wiring nor batteries. Just place the "Light Stone" at any sunny spot. Two stakes included provide a secure hold when needed. The matte white plastic housing is robust and weatherproof. The solar module hidden inside "Smart Stone" together with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light. The battery charges already when sunlight falls on the housing. At dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; in which color is up to you: six attractive light colors are available to you - besides white - to choose from. The automatic shut-off finally occurs when the battery charging level has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it gets bright again. As soon as the sun comes out again, the charging cycle starts anew the next day.
I have done this several times, and it has not worked.

Hello dear women,  I hope I'm doing everything right here. It's actually my first post after a year. To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible cramps during my period and such bad PMS before it. Now I would like to stay away from it because I already have to take enough medication due to my chronic illness that I can't choose for myself. My main problem, surprisingly not the cramps, but my skin. I suddenly got explosive acne all over my body when I stopped taking the pill for about two years, and it never really normalized during that time. Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this this time. My cosmetics are already parfum-free and without drama, but maybe someone can recommend something to me. My gynecologist unfortunately didn't take me seriously and I still have to make an appointment with a dermatologist. Thank you to everyone who has read the book! Yes, the dear skin is such a thing. I had severe premenstrual syndrome, then a time of rest, then widespread cystic acne and the topic of acne. I have also tried everything in the context of my chronic illness, including a low-sugar, dairy-free mixed diet, because otherwise nothing worked well. It can also be good that hormonally there is just a little worm in there, but if you want to avoid construction sites like me, you just don't want to look for it anymore, otherwise everything goes wrong.
I had already written everything to her colleague's seminar o. ä. and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern. I have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money were there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.

In the name of the people: lay judges sit in everyday clothes on the bench in the courtroom. But much depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear a robe: lay assessors determine with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes behind bars. Two of them report in conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht an der John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately, I cannot access the customer account. Could you please send the invoice for order number #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the material of the packaging? We do not have the possibility to keep it for so long. We would use the table as if it were ours, as it is offered to us.
Certainly, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November of the same year and received it. Therefore, I would now like to order a chair in gray.
Must the shelf be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
A new 110-kV earth cable will be built in 2022. The permission for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid. The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria makes the way for the construction, which is scheduled to start in 2022. This was now announced by the network operator Bayernwerk. The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a transmission tower of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part so far. The blue seller number: #PRS\_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible". The other three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me what the next step is? Have a great start to the week!
You can forget about it, I have already explained this several times yesterday! It is a glass commode, and all the sides are inflated, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken. The commode is in my apartment, and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come in because of #PRS\_ORG# regulations. This means that the commode cannot be picked up, because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request was made at #PRS\_ORG#, as it probably involves a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues,  I have been working in the ref since the summer, and teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems with time-efficient planning of my geography lessons. Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the textbook, and an OHP as media. In the school, I can also only print in black and white (which is a nuisance for geography). I currently need very long to plan my lessons. For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and basically every lesson stands on its own. The methods are always the same, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching units (I also need that time for UBs, etc.). I always plan from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We have the book Terra, and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied. Therefore, also the worksheets. Maybe someone can teach me one day how to work time-efficiently with the book. I would be really happy.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. I have actually already decided on a new one from #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G rule for Christmas business. In most shops, only those who are vaccinated or have recovered can enter. The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales losses. A possible solution is also ready. The 2G regulations harm the important Christmas business of the German Retail Association (HDE) according to the trade association. With non-daily goods stores, sales losses should be expected, criticized HDE managing director Stefan Genth. According to a current HDE survey of over 1,100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year. Many had already written off the Christmas business. "What should be the positive highlight of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," said Genth. Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their turnover in the past week. Only the food retail and online trade are doing well. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development. "Purchasing with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter," said Genth. "2G when shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations deter customers and require a high personnel effort. The wristband solution should be allowed nationwide, he demanded. Then, each customer would only need to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all stores with the received wristband on that day. In addition, in retail, as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested), random sample controls should be sufficient. Even the real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona levels, and the sales at about 90%. These numbers will now certainly fall in the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of the "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approvals will be obtained for the centers. This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, would have to present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a hotel room, could freely visit all stores." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error with the frame that was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filling material. This looks unsightly. I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it and sealed it back up. How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance construction, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color rendering. For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is used. In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K and save it. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitively operable. The lamp generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent. By the way, it is also suitable for reporter situations in small rooms or short distances. You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work with both on the film set and in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficult-to-access places. On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included) on the back of the lamp. The user storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To save the settings of individual positions on the storage locations, simply long-press one of the storage buttons and finish. The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when the lamp is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures. Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. This results from the ability to operate the lamp with inexpensive NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also be checked before the set whether the batteries have sufficient performance - it is a built-in battery tester. For each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display shows (the upper battery compartment on the upper display, the right battery compartment on the lower display). In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the flashlight with power via the supplied power supply. The construction of the flashlight is very simple. You have a 16mm thread for attachment, so you can attach the flashlight directly to your photo tripod. The tilt is set reliably via adjustment screws on both sides. It was taken into account that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use. In addition, a tilting joint is included in the delivery. Great is that the delivery also includes a bag. So you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to purchase without any problems.
Sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt. After 22 minutes, the last time they won twice in a row, it seemed that the Hesse were on their way to another Bundesliga failure. But then the SGE turned it around, shot off their frustration over a mediocre season start within an hour and won wildly with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," jubiled coach Oliver Glasner to DAZN and gave a "general compliment to everyone who was there," expressing admiration for their performance. It initially looked like another dampener for the Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place. Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead. But what happened next impressed even the SGE coach. "How the players came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued. I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result. Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game week and his injured muscle, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased for the fans with the result. That was the party we wanted to throw. But for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, and he feels well prepared in terms of personnel. It is extraordinary that all players are fit in December and in top physical condition. It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally. Now you want to "take it step by step and stay humble" and go through the tasks until the end of the year "at this level." The next game is already scheduled for Wednesday, as part of the English week, an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky).
I will receive a grade because my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part. I have tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and have it redirected, but there is no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again, or must I wait until the money is refunded and the order is resubmitted? Unfortunately, this would mean that I would not order again because it has already taken very long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Dampfer for Handball Women before Quarterfinal against Spain  Germany's Handball Women slid off the court with hanging heads and empty stares after the humiliating defeat against Denmark in the group stage. In the final round of the World Cup, the DHB selection suffered a harsh defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national team coach Henk Groener. Against Spain, we must act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in group III with 8:2 points behind Denmark (10:0). It's unfortunate that we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, against the 2019 World Cup runner-up on the upcoming Tuesday, a significant improvement is needed to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive. The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was right-back Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted right-back Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now quickly look ahead." From front to back, the German team was not at its best. Poor throws and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at full speed and prevented worse with some saves. The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a fast counterattack. However, this was not the expected spark. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Danish goalkeeper's net. So the game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since right-back Mia Zschocke saw a red card for a hard foul on her opponent shortly afterwards. However, she can participate again in the quarterfinals. Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection start to play better and at least came within five goals of the break. The already quiet hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19. Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who counts among the medal candidates at the finals. In the end, the German team could not muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

The title is already set, I am an immunization doctor working in mobile immunization teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these will soon be completed to a large extent, it will now go partly to immunization centers for me. I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally based (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination..."). In my area of responsibility is the education for the vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me before). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants. However, we often do not have doctors in immunization teams, but only pharmaceutical-technical assistants for vaccine preparation, who cannot administer vaccinations (should not?), so I also perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: The Amberg man knows the solution What please is an "Huidlerer"? With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg man, heated thinking has been aroused in the BR television show "We in Bavaria". But unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" this time remained unguessed by the callers. No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And neither was it "one who everything has to go quickly for". That, the people heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong. Whereupon the man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus probably also surprised many Upper Palatinate people. "The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a cloth used to wipe the oven". Dialectologist Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian Television for years as an expert, confirmed this. With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the better known dialect word "Houdern". With which a gap in education was closed - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy any books for the past two weeks. After confirmation, the following error message always appears: "oops - something went wrong - try again later." I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# service, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing has helped.
Tire Choice for Racing Bikes - Really That Safe? I've been eagerly awaiting today, because I wanted to prepare for my upcoming cycling tour next week by at least a little bit of training. Said and done, and I went out on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were great too - but then what happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: Thanks Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the route on no account. Since I couldn't really get a replacement tire and tube on Wednesday due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't quite as bad weather-wise, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the tour. Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long route over several days ahead of me, I would extremely unwillingly have this problem again and again. Now it wasn't really bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had driven 140km on the day I picked up the bike until 14:12!) and he also already described them as suboptimal because he had driven with them for years. But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tire after 80-90km, then I'm afraid I'm really in a bad mood :D Now I've had a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbreakable. That sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible? I don't want to spend 40€/tire now to find out that I'm disappointed. I continue to wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my bike, which is apparently also available (apparently?) with Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider. Is this a problem? Or would you advise me to other tires with a racing bike in general? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! My knowledge of the topic is rather in favor of the Durano DD. Thank you already in advance for the help and warm greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and collided with a central reservation.

Hello everyone,  Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST this year! Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement. BUT: At least three people will be present per switch, so we will be able to stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you!  We will do our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.  It will start around 0:30. Get yourself some drinks ready, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
