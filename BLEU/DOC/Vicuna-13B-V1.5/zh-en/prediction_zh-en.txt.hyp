A meaningful certificate - the First Aid Certificate is one of the important skill certificates, besides the driver's license, that I think is valuable! Let me explain: First Aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken during sudden events, that is, emergency treatment before the ambulance arrives. As we all know, it takes a certain amount of time for the ambulance to arrive after an accident occurs, and this is the most critical time. This is the time when we need first aid. If I were to really have a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or stop breathing, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes! Therefore, knowing first aid is so important for those around us! When someone falls nearby, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly doing nothing, which is a terrifying feeling. "In China, official data shows that there are three million accidental deaths every year, and the most dangerous is heart attack. In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved. In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70-80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%." This is what the founder of First Reaction, Lu Le, said. If someone has a heart attack, stops breathing, and has no heartbeat, CPR is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compression are necessary to try to save the person's life. I found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when an emergency happens, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations. It may save a life! You can sign up for the First Aid Certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are even discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25, and adding the First Aid Certificate to my goal list was a few months ago, but I did complete it! Now I'm going to take other certificates I want to take, and I'm planning to take a diving certificate. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a diving first aid certificate, and it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take the diving certificate, so the First Aid Certificate is still very useful!

Chongqing to Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System in Vocational Schools: Enterprise Employment upon Enrollment - Xinhua Net  According to information obtained by reporters from the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, starting this year, Chongqing will pilot a "modern apprenticeship system" model for talent cultivation in 60 vocational schools. Students accepted for the pilot program will have both student and apprentice identities. After being recruited and enrolled, they will be pre-employed by the pilot enterprise as unit employees.  The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires standardization of the recruitment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identities of students as both vocational school students and potential enterprise employees. According to the principle of mutual selection, a tripartite agreement will be signed by the apprentice, the school, and the enterprise. For apprentices who are under 16 years old and have not yet reached 18 years old, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the apprentice, the guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific job position, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the apprentice's on-the-job training.  The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt the modern apprenticeship system format and jointly conduct enterprise employee pre-job training and transfer training with cooperating enterprises. The pilot schools must reform their talent cultivation mode, jointly design talent cultivation plans with enterprises, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans. The pilot program will use the enrollment period as a cycle, and the length of the apprentice's internship in the enterprise will be determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan, generally lasting six months.  In enterprise practice, the enterprise-based management mode should be implemented, with one mentor leading two to five apprentices to form a study group to ensure that apprentices are proficient in the skills required for each rotational job position. According to the arrangements, from 2016 to August 2019, Chongqing has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship system pilot schools, with about 50 people in each school, and a total of about 3,000 apprentices (students) to be trained. According to the principle of pilot first and then promotion, the pilot schools will gradually promote the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint enrollment, joint cultivation, and one-stop talent cultivation, gradually improving the skills of students on the job, improving their employment rates and employment quality.

I no longer have to worry about being burned by hot oil or about not being able to control the heat and burning the food. The food that comes out tastes better than what I make, and the tomatoes and eggs are especially delicious. This pot is a good buy. The product is good, and it is worth buying. Overall, it is very good, clear, and consistent with the description. It is worth having. The customer service is also very good. The screen is large, clear, and easy on the eyes.

South African doctor: Omicron's transmission power is strong but mostly mild symptoms  Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng, where the country's largest city, Johannesburg, is located, said that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The head of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are more likely to develop severe symptoms from COVID-19. He said that compared to the previous Delta wave, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks of South Africa's first report of the Omicron variant, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the observations and early evidence of doctors provide some clues. According to a summary by the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the COVID-19 patients who were recently hospitalized, only 30% had severe symptoms, which is half of the severity ratio of the previous wave; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% died, while the death rate reached 20% in the early outbreak cases in South Africa. The head of the African Health Research Institute, Dr. William Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a milder disease." He also said, "We still need to get the later data. Generally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods. Although the Delta variant is still the main COVID-19 strain worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in more than 40 countries, with South Africa as the epicenter. According to health officials, the number of new cases in Gauteng province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that Omicron variant cases accounted for more than 90%.

Actually, I don't know if it was a mistake by the store or the courier. The package did not have a receipt, and it cannot be traced. I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time displayed is faster by 30 minutes than the actual delivery time, thank you.
Yes, I've changed drivers. He's been waiting for a long time. That restaurant has been saying they're processing it for hours.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps postponing the delivery time.
It turns out that I didn't call for #NUMBER# after all.
If you don't eat, I will definitely complain that you can't deliver. Why don't you tell me earlier? You made me wait for so long.
No, I haven't received the call. Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.
A meal has been waiting for one and a half hours, but it has not been delivered yet. I want to cancel the order, why can't I?
Hello, the live chicken delivered by the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively cheap racket to practice with first. However, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish between them, then it's normal for the more expensive racket to be more friendly than the cheaper one. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the racket, it vibrates a lot, and the ball doesn't stay on the racket. Even professionals find it difficult to control them. Their logic and hidden agenda are - tennis is so difficult, you won't be able to learn it, and you don't want to buy the expensive one, so we'll give you a cheap one to fool you. You'll play twice and then never play again, and that's how we make money. When you can really distinguish between good and bad, it means you've progressed, and then you can come back and buy the expensive one from me. I'll make twice as much money. I suggest spending a similar amount of money and buying a slightly used good racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are well-known enough, so good rackets won't sell for a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 yuan is fine, and a used one for 200 yuan is enough to enjoy the benefits of a thousand-yuan racket, isn't that great? For beginners, it's quite friendly, but after the beginner stage, it's a pain in the neck. However, most people, especially women, can't get past the beginner stage.
The order has been repeatedly delayed in terms of delivery time. May I ask for your help in following up on it? Thank you for your understanding.
That is to say, I already have credit, right?
Next, do I need to place another order? Can I ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but there were many things missing in the food that was delivered, and the chicken was also raw.
#PRS\_ORG# has no reason to say that I should self-pickup, please cancel it. My order is for delivery, and there is no self-pickup involved.
In the next three years, Jiangxi will train 1,000 rural primary school music, art, and physical education teachers - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Nanchang May 22 (Reporter Chen Yuxuan) A journalist recently learned from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education that in order to strengthen the shortage of subject teachers and achieve balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, starting from 2016, Jiangxi Province plans to train 1,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for each primary school in the province's rural areas (towns and below) in three years. According to understanding, the training objects are teachers in rural primary schools in Jiangxi who are under 45 years old and have a foundation or talent in music, art, and physical education and can serve as other subject teachers. Through training, they can master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music, art, and physical education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a versatile music, art, and physical education teacher team to alleviate the shortage of music, art, and physical education teachers in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi also plans to train 300 music, art, and physical education teachers for 100 primary schools in the province, including counties (cities and districts), with each school training one person. They will comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leading ability, teaching research activity design organization ability, training ability, network training workshop construction ability, and play a teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising role.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.

For girls with slightly plump figures, the pursuit of clothing matching is quite a lot. Skirts that are too short or too long are not suitable for girls with plump figures. The length should be around the knees, just enough to cover the plump thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs. If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and plump. If the skirt is divided into three sections, it will make you look taller, and using different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks can create a slimming effect. Many girls with plump figures prefer dark-colored clothing, which is also a good way to cover up their plumpness. Black shorts are a favorite of plump girls. Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make people think you are thinner. If the lower legs are plump, the socks and shoes should not be too noticeable. The more popular the clothing, the better, and the color should not be too eye-catching to avoid drawing attention to the legs and feet, giving people a sense of being plump. For slightly plump girls, it is important to know the tricks of clothing matching. Plump girls should not wear tight short skirts, and the upper garment should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which can make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, it is recommended to wear black tights or grid pattern socks (the kind with a finer pattern), and choose a soft and delicate printed chiffon skirt, match it with a blouse, and it can cover up the shortcomings of plump girls very well. Of course, plump girls should also pay attention to their clothing matching when wearing short skirts. Plump girls wearing short skirts should choose a top of the same color as the skirt, which can make the figure look taller. Matching high heels with short skirts can make the legs look longer, which is the most popular match in the summer! If you are plump but have thin legs, MM, I recommend choosing a fancy short dress. Not only can it cover up your belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A-line skirts are very slimming and suitable for plump girls. The top should be tight-fitting to create a layered effect, which will make you look thinner. Simple and plain white T-shirts can also be matched with short skirts, and plump MMs can also try it. Girls with slightly plump figures can also show their sense of fashion. As long as they can master the rules of clothing matching, plump girls will also become the focus of everyone's attention. After changing the way of clothing matching, it is also necessary to exercise more in life and strive to get rid of the label of plump girls as soon as possible😄

I originally planned to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he was in a hurry, so I had to buy it in advance. Therefore, I missed the big bank activity, which is a bit regretful. However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics are also quite fast. It will take some time to evaluate it in the future. It is a highly cost-effective gaming notebook. The design style is very good. It has already installed Windows 11 and Office 2019. Display effect: I bought it for my child to use for 3D rendering. The software is installed, and the child said it can be used without problem. This laptop is quite good for 3D design work. I bought it for my son, and he said it was good. The computer is quite good, especially the customer service attitude. If you don't understand something, it is good to ask. I recommend purchasing it. It is still quite good for gaming, and the picture quality is really good.
Is there only one shrimp dumpling order? Why are there 6 copies?
I won't go. I'm a delivery person. In the past hour, no one has contacted me, which is basically an online scam. Do you think this is my first time ordering takeout? After investigating, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order. Thank you! How many days?
From 7 pm to now 9:30 am, it has not been delivered yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order. Okay.
Claiming to have the loudest exhaust note in the mountain district, this time our team brings you a dream car for many men - the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the Aventador LP700-4, the successor to the Murcielago! Priced at nearly two million yuan, with an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, it has four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? Well, the editor doesn't know either, but according to the data, it can accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in just 2.9 seconds, which means that by the time the editor's Myvi reaches 30km/h, the car has already reached 100km/h! The low car body, aggressive air intakes on all sides, and the massive 6.5 V12 engine visible through the glass perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini. For a detailed explanation of the car, a Google search is enough, and the editor has prepared some descriptions that Google may not provide! It's too eye-catching, with everyone looking at it, making the editor feel a bit embarrassed (but also kind of cool)! 1km fuel consumption is around RM1 (the owner doesn't care at all). When getting in and out of the car, you need to practice a bit to avoid embarrassment (otherwise, you won't be able to get out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud, and your ears will be ringing after getting out of the car (but it's still very cool). The car body is too big and will be very narrow when parked in a regular parking space, and there is a risk of being hit by a car when the partition is opened! It's a bit lonely on the road because there is no competitor (the editor said it himself, and it has nothing to do with the owner, haha). Don't misunderstand, this video's supercar is not for sale, sorry! If you have friends who want to shoot videos of their supercars, please feel free to contact us! For more car news that you may not know, check out The Car Guide / People's Automotive Gazette, which is worth millions of dollars in car accidents! The Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are probably known to all car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the millions! Recently, a supercar and a million-dollar sports car were crashed in just a few minutes abroad! The result is reasonable!

The duration of leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be extended from 2 to 5 years based on the original curriculum, and the time for entrepreneurship can be considered as practical education time.  To promote the improvement of entrepreneurship and innovation ability of university students, the education and human resources departments of Guangxi have jointly built entrepreneurship platforms, established more off-campus practical education bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, entrepreneurship incubation bases, and other facilities to provide external support for university student entrepreneurship.  According to requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases for undergraduate schools should be over 3,000 square meters, and for vocational schools, it should be over 2,000 square meters. The government encourages universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship courses, and prefers to support outstanding students who perform well in innovation and entrepreneurship practice.  University teachers should go to industrial enterprises for on-the-job training for at least two months every two years to improve their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education. The Education Department of the Autonomous Region requires universities in Guangxi to deeply implement university student innovation and entrepreneurship training plans and strive to ensure that every university student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school years. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.

Whole Visual Wedding Photography Base (Hebei Store) does not have any branches yet. Wedding dresses are fashionable and avant-garde, and the makeup artist is also top-notch. The photography techniques and angles are professional, and the shooting effects are very good. The seller is very trustworthy, and the service attitude is also very good. The makeup is exquisite, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very happy, and the professional team provided very good service. The seller's service attitude was very good, and I would recommend it to my friends. I am very satisfied. I would like to thank the photographer and makeup artist for allowing me to have unique wedding photos. I would like to thank all the staff who worked on my wedding photos today, and I look forward to seeing the finished product. Taking wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for the photographer who runs and jumps. The makeup artist designed a makeup look that suited my face type, and the photographer was humorous during the shooting. I would like to thank my photographer and makeup artist for allowing me to see myself so beautifully. The bride is beautiful, with pretty eyes and a generous face. She looks like a virtuous wife and mother at first glance. The groom is lucky to have a happy life with a beautiful bride. The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what is said online. My partner and I are very satisfied with our handsome and beautiful photos. The seller's service attitude is also very enthusiastic. This trip not only enjoyed the scenery but also took beautiful wedding photos, and I also made a good friend with the photographer. The wedding photos are too beautiful, and I must praise the photographer and makeup artist. They are really super professional. I am very grateful to Sister Mu for her patience and guidance, and I like the photos taken very much~ When I saw my wedding photos, I suddenly realized that I didn't recognize myself at first. As long as the photographer is good, you can also have wedding photos that can rival those of celebrities. The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and makeup artist are both aesthetic, and fortunately, I met them. After seeing my wedding photos, I found out that I was also a "photography cheat."
Asian-American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian-American organizations in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, accusing Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. The chairman of the alliance, Zhao Yuanguo, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of Ivy League schools has increased many times, but the proportion of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these schools have systematically and continuously discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the so-called "holistic review" admissions process. Zhao Yuanguo introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the acceptance rate of Asian-Americans relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuanguo told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in the admissions process after determining the facts. They also hope that the complained-against schools will take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans. So far, the three schools have not responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds. This time, in addition to American Chinese organizations, the complaint also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yushan Town, Yongkang, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan through the bank. Lin signed on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the recipient, stipulating that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week." However, due to disagreements on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of sale and payment methods, the factory purchase and sale contract was not signed. Considering that the parties could not reach an agreement on the contract content, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu a few days later. The house that Mr. Lu had been eyeing for a long time, with the deposit paid and the purchase price ready, was just "one step away" from signing the contract, but the seller did not sell. This made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry. Therefore, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Lin in the People's Court of Yongkang City. After trial, the court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it was not appropriate to apply the penalty for forfeiture of deposit, and Lin was not required to bear the liability of double return of deposit for breach of contract. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second-instance court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] It is necessary to fulfill the necessary diligence in the transaction process. When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied by others, and clearly stipulating the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes in the performance of the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send the wrong address.
Dayong Restaurant (Wudongkou Store) [Mint] Environment: Regular and orderly [Service Bell] Service: Quick service "Old-style Marble Cake" is my must-order dish. The marble cake is too fragrant, too soft, and too delicious 😋 Fans of desserts must try "Dongjiang Mandarin Fish Sweet and Sour Tofu Pot" The soup is very fresh, the tofu is tender, the Mandarin fish has a good taste... praise, the meat is good, the service is warm and enthusiastic. It's been a long time since I came to Dayong, and the fruit tea is still so good & made with real ingredients, and the first time I ordered pork belly buns, it's just the soft and southern-style dough I love! The congee is just right in terms of dryness and wetness, the portion is very generous, the signature stainless steel chicken wings are as good as ever, and the side dishes are also praiseworthy... praise, the meat is good, the service is warm and enthusiastic. Dayong Old Store, it was a famous existence on the internet many years ago, in the East China Building, with wooden floors. You had to wait a long time at the door before you could eat the congee, and the congee pot was all cracked... It's been several years since I haven't eaten at Dayong, and the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the flow of people. It's rare to see a seat when you arrive, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever. Praise, the meat is good, the main dishes are praiseworthy, Dayong Takeout. [Rice] Meal: The dishes this time are a bit disappointing. Three-cup chicken: The dish is a bit too salty, and the chicken is a bit scarce. The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, not salty enough, which highlights the sweetness, and everyone can imagine adding sweetness and various spices to the dish...
What is the method of drinking Red Letter Whisky? Everyone's preferences are different, some like collecting, some like food, and of course, some like drinking whisky. Red Letter Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and it has also won international awards for whisky. Each bottle of Red Letter Whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you would waste its aroma. So, how do you drink Red Letter Whisky? Here's a simple introduction:  Red Letter Whisky Drinking Method: Red Letter Whisky is composed of about 35 different Scotch whiskies, with a strong and traditional flavor of Scotch whisky. It has a rich and fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. When you take a sip, you can taste the strong alcohol and a hint of vanilla and smoky barley. This whisky can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.  When Red Letter Whisky was introduced to the domestic market, it was adjusted to suit local tastes. Red Letter Whisky + soda, beer, or other bubbly drinks have become a timeless fashion trend. These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sourness but also bring visual pleasure, and when added to the drink, they can change the taste of the whisky.  The most authentic and traditional way to drink Red Letter Whisky is with a slice of lemon and sugar (cane sugar can also be used). The taste of Red Letter Whisky is a bit sour, and adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, while the lemon will give the whisky a refreshing aroma. Of course, the sweet and sour ratio can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.  The above three methods are the best ways to drink Red Letter Whisky. You can try them as a reference, and I hope my introduction can help you.
If it's not possible to change my store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?

Mrs. Jin's Wedding Dress Photography (Nanjing Road Store) currently does not have any branch stores. Due to our poor scheduling, we had to change the photography time twice before the shoot. The consultant, Lanlan, was very patient in helping us arrange a time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to shoot. The staff of Mrs. Jin's were all amazing, whether it was the consultant, makeup artist, or photographer. This was my first formal makeup job, and I was amazed at how good I looked. Xiao Jing and another makeup artist (sorry, I forget her name) were very patient and natural in their makeup work. The outdoor photos were taken in Jing'an City, and luckily, the weather was great, and we didn't feel cold during the shoot. The makeup artist occasionally reminded us to pay attention to our clothes, accessories, and would immediately help us if there was anything wrong. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy throughout the day of shooting. When it came to selecting photos, we saw many examples online and didn't want to delete too many photos, but the package we chose had 24 photos, and we didn't have to add any (heard that a friend who took her wedding dress photos around the same time had a 7,000 yuan package that included over 1,000 photos, which shocked me at the time, and I was afraid of choosing too many). Today, the photos are ready, and Lanlan sent them to me. I found two that I didn't like, and they immediately re-edited them for me. When we compared the photos with my sister's previous photos, I was very satisfied with ours. They were simple and clean, which was the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xinhan Mrs. Jin to take wedding dress photos! The package price is 3,999 yuan. Mrs. Jin thanks you for your support, and we wish you a happy and prosperous life. How much is this package?

Your name is Zheng Meng, and this is your second week in Japan. You are walking on the street when you suddenly realize that someone is following you. You get scared and start running faster and faster until you finally take off. The person behind you shouts, "Miss! Please wait!" (Japanese dialogue throughout) You stop at the entrance of a convenience store. "Miss... I am a director. I think you look very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You are very puzzled and scared that this might be a scam. He hands you a business card, and you find out that he is indeed a director of a major entertainment company in Japan. "Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The pay will definitely not be low." You hesitantly agree to go to the company with him. He says he saw you on the street and really hopes you can participate. You think to yourself that there's no loss and you might even make some money, so you sign the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts. In the first part, celebrities and ordinary people will live together in real life to cultivate mutual understanding. In the second part, they will enter the game together to explore the dungeon. The official recording will start next week, and you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen.
So, how will the system handle that delivery rider?
I think I cannot accept orders that take more than 20 minutes to deliver.
Sabah's 3,200 newborn babies without birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the counterfeit-proof paper inventory being used up, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, with a total of 3,200 affected. However, the department's director, Kamaruzaman Abu Kassim, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system and will be issued once the counterfeit-proof paper arrives next week. He explained at a press conference that a news report by a certain media outlet that Sabah's birth certificate printing problem had persisted for 10 months was not accurate. He said that the issue arose two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces the counterfeit-proof paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in its arrival in Malaysia." He explained that the counterfeit-proof paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. Kamaruzaman Abu Kassim revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit-proof paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work. "The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week and immediately carry out the final stage of printing in Sabah. It is estimated that it can be handed over to the applicants in two working days (December 20th)." "We will notify the applicants to go to the respective branches to collect the birth certificates." He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates this year.

48-Hour Negative Nucleic Acid Test Required, Establish "Buffer Zones" - National Health Commission Requires Strengthening of Epidemic Prevention and Control at Ports of Entry - Xinhua Net  Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters: Dong Ruifeng, Tian Cheng) The National Health Commission recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work of new coronavirus pneumonia at ports of entry, requiring persons who have recently left land border ports of entry (excluding those with ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and persons entering land border ports of entry to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. According to the notice, the time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the scope of ports of entry in each province, municipality, and autonomous region to March 15, 2022.  In addition, the notice proposes that ports of entry with conditions may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. Officials from the National Health Commission's Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control explained that for some ports of entry, cross-border trade is a major economic support, and there is frequent travel between the two sides. Implementing differential management policies and turning a single line of epidemic prevention and control into two lines can achieve the goal of moving the border epidemic prevention and control line forward, compressing the risk of epidemic spread, and achieving the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.  Recently, there have been multiple local outbreaks of COVID-19 in China, all of which were imported through ports of entry. The notice pointed out that this has exposed some problems, such as delayed monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formalization of nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of the entire chain of cold chain items, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise epidemic emergency handling. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism of ports of entry, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the weak links in the prevention and control of ports of entry. The notice emphasizes that ports of entry should synchronize epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihoods, study and deploy together, announce and open the people's livelihood protection hotline, regularly investigate and solve the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic living materials, and actively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public.  According to the notice, the ports of entry mentioned include those with land, water, and air ports, including counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (states, provinces, leagues) where they are located, and directly administered cities. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

This item is vintage clothing. For first-time buyers of vintage clothing, please consult the terms "vintage" or "vintage clothing" on Baidu. This is a single item. Vintage clothing is inevitably subject to minor flaws, so if you decide to purchase vintage-style products, you should mentally prepare for this. If you are a perfectionist, I will point out any more obvious flaws. This is a characteristic of vintage clothing products, and personally, I don't think it's a big deal for minor imperfections! The store does not accept returns or exchanges for vintage clothing products. So-called vintage clothing, vintage design will have a sense of nostalgia for the era, that is, retro. The reason why people like vintage clothing is because they like its sense of time and its texture!

Online shopping has risks, and purchases should be made with caution. If the item is not suitable or not liked for personal reasons, it can be returned to the seller for resale.

Translation:  On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machines" on the Bilibili platform sparked widespread attention. The video tells the story of how the United States, under the pretext of "counter-terrorism," launched a war in Afghanistan to forcefully export American-style democracy, resulting in 20 years of brutal violence, bloodthirsty nature, and indiscriminate killings, committing various anti-human atrocities. The US has abused drones to bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, distorted human nature, and formed killing squads. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians. The US military set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation. One atrocity after another has aroused more hatred among the Afghan people. As the video said, the US "counter-terrorism" war is becoming more and more terrifying. The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only left a country full of scars and countless killings and destruction. Watch the video and let's expose together the truth of the US's "counter-terrorism" and bloodthirsty killings, and pierce through the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
The meal was delivered late, and the food had cooled down. After cooling down, it became dry and hard, and it was completely impossible to eat. Moreover, the soup had spilled out.
Immediately cancel it. The things that he #PRS\_ORG# supplemented have definitely cooled down. I haven't taken them! #NAME# said that no one has gone to pick them up. We have called over there, and if you don't give a refund, I will report it to the police.
I have used #PRS\_ORG# multiple times before, but today's experience was the worst. I cannot accept it at all. It's okay, but I also need to remind the restaurant and the delivery rider to avoid similar incidents in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time. The time keeps getting delayed, and I don't know how long to wait. If I cancel the order, can I get a refund for the deposit?
How to pay service fees to the delivery rider?
A rider confirmed more than an hour ago that they were no longer willing to wait.
Don't Frighten People at the Starting Line - Xinhua Net  When strolling through a book market, one can often sense the heat of success books. Many of the so-called "best principles" in today's success books are about "assuming or implying that you can do it," and then telling you what you need to do "is what." In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it" at one go. Therefore, these books all have a common feature: either they push you to do your best and nothing else, or they push you to do 100% or 0%; or they push you to climb Mount Tai or just wait in place. This "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "correct beyond doubt," but 99% of people are intimidated at the starting line.  This theory promotes a path of "making a firm decision, rebuilding oneself, and making a 180-degree turn," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who are rigid, conservative, and resistant to change, you should shout in their ears, "You need to transform," which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the fool. Most people will be intimidated at the word "transformation," hesitant to move forward, and find it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, they may make a hasty decision to "transform" and boldly take the first step, but it often doesn't last long, and they fail soon after.  Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue in "From Tomorrow Onwards" best illustrates this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, which often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people feel frustrated. Perhaps "the good-enough principle" is a path that can allow more ordinary people to embark on a relatively successful journey. The core of the "good-enough principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories," that is, even if you can't do 100%, doing 1 is fine because 1 is always greater than 0; even if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing a small sand dune in front of your home is fine because it is still better than standing still.  In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing. With the threshold significantly lowered, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as they persevere, the chances of success will increase. However, the path of following the "good-enough principle" is slightly longer. In summary, the "best principle" may wave the flag of making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can only inspire a few; while the "good-enough principle" can effectively inspire more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
Telephone unanswered, delay after delay, still not delivered. May I ask when it will be delivered? How can I contact you? Please cancel the order. I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He is two meals short of delivery, but one order has already been completed. I want to ask, how do I contact the delivery rider that the first rider told me about? There should be another rider coming to deliver.
Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources have increased by 710 tons this year - Xinhua Net  Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) - According to the latest monitoring results, Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources have increased by 710 tons this year compared to last year, reaching a total of 108,500 tons. This is 40 times more than the total increase since the initial protection in 2002.  Qinghai Lake's naked carp is also known as "Yangtze River fish" and is a valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and the biodiversity of the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human over-fishing and the degradation of the breeding environment, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake amounted to only 2,592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake naked carp was listed as an endangered species in China's Red List of Species.  Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a "closed lake breeding" policy, prohibiting any units, groups, or individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, as well as from selling or producing naked carp and its products. At the same time, through artificial breeding and release and the cleaning of the main inflow rivers and channels of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages," the province has continuously increased its efforts to protect the naked carp resources.  As of now, Qinghai Lake has implemented artificial breeding and release of nearly 1.8 billion naked carp, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the recovery of naked carp resources. The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water source recharge area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.  In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the water body of Qinghai Lake, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake."

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, even though the weather was cold.
May I ask, is the takeout food delivered in a bag? We only see one bag and want to know if it's a mistake or if someone took it, thank you.
It's already been 1 hour, but it still hasn't been delivered.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and it's disappointing to receive the wrong order. I need to make another reservation for the children to eat. I hope the restaurant can check the quality of the food while being busy.
Taking a foot bath with tingling feet, is it a leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's awareness of health, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from less than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice. According to related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are booming, but foot baths do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li used a pen to test it, and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was conductive. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath was refunded, Mr. Li still felt uneasy. Because he found that the popular foot bath that has been around for a long time now has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, suitability for which population, and guarantee of safety materials. However, in general, foot baths are unlikely to have a problem with electricity, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a detachable foot bath. The water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety risk. At the same time, you can use a pen to test it at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily - Hunan Voice - On December 10th, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Changhua Red Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the pursuit of a thousand billion yuan tea industry goal. Vice Chairman of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Alliance, Huang Shunli, and Vice Chairman of the Hunan People's Congress Standing Committee, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, China Academy of Engineering Professor Liu Zhonghua introduced with great fanfare: "The source of Hunan Red is in New Changhua, and the rise of red tea injects new momentum into 'Five-color Tea in Hunan'." In recent years, the Provincial Committee and Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a thousand billion yuan of Hunan Red Tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Hunan and Four Waters, Five-color Tea." The tea industry in Hunan has increased innovation, with mainstay teas such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert their strength, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving income for large numbers of tea farmers. The winds of fortune have shifted, and red tea is once again exerting its strength. According to experts in the tea industry in Hunan, with the completion of green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens is on the rise. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and New Changhua cheered the "Source of Hunan Red." At the New Changhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant was interested in a high mountain tea called "Ice in Spring," and immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the Tea Expo, the highlights are numerous. The red color of New Changhua Red Tea injects cultural connotations, and the popularity is high, transactions are brisk, and the Hunan tea industry welcomes a new spring.

With #PRS\_ORG# as a witness, it was done without anyone taking it, and #PRS\_ORG# falsely accused me of taking it myself. I repeat once again, what I sent was a delivery slip, and no one from your side took it to deliver the food. Instead, you falsely accused me of taking it myself. I demand that you immediately cancel it, otherwise, I will report it to the police.
Time Capsule Photography has not yet opened a branch. Member evaluation [effect]: I took two sets of clothing. Overall, the photos are not bad. I quite like this set of photos. [Service]: The details of the service: Due to discomfort during pregnancy, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest on one side while continuously providing me with warm water to drink. The price for the set is 1000 yuan. Thank you, Kiki, for your evaluation. Originally, I said that ancient style was not suitable for ancient style, but the finished product is too beautiful. Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can fill us with energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend it to all little brothers and sisters! From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is nothing to fault. The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match a makeup style that suits you based on your personality. The makeup products used are also top-notch brands. Teacher Liang is even more impressive when it comes to photography, which is quite professional. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with. We work in Beijing, and it takes half a year to queue for a good photography studio in Beijing. My colleagues have had their photos taken in Beijing, and after seeing the finished product, they think it's just so-so. We specifically searched for this studio, a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expressions are not very good, but the photographer, Big Brother Ke, will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments. The makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, it's a great team. The finished photos have received praise from us and those around us. I have already recommended my girlfriends to come, and my girlfriends who have just seen the negatives are also overjoyed. I hope this kind of studio will not be overlooked, and more people will discover it and take photos that belong to themselves, rather than being the same as everyone else. Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Jinying and Chengling. Both are very creative and innovative newcomers. We are a creative studio. As long as the customer likes us, we will give our all to complete the job. We are grateful to have met each other. The sweet and thoughtful assistant and the lively and open photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice. It was a wonderful and unforgettable experience to take photos, and the results of the photos are much better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘 Thank you, Xiaoyu, for your review. Meeting you is a kind of fate. From Chifeng to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is a journey of thousands of miles. I am very happy to have met you. If there is a chance, I hope to come to Qinhuangdao again to play.
How should I give the money? The re-sent meal has already been delivered.
There is no delivery person to receive the order. Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
I am a beginner programmer who wants to share my personal experience. If you are planning to enter this industry, it is recommended to find a place to receive training, but if you do not have this idea, self-study is still a good choice. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes six months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is an excellent choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. First, look at the institution's teacher strength, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some new training institutions may not have particularly strong teacher strength. Secondly, before choosing, it is best to investigate this training institution, and it is better to investigate the students who have come out of this institution. After all, only the students of the institution know how good or bad the institution is. The explanation of the course is good. Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because you have not introduced your own situation. Learning this thing and your personal situation have a great relationship. For example, major, age, language you want to learn, and even which city you are in, all of these will be related to your learning or the industry you want to engage in. If you are a student and have not graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer major, I personally suggest self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many online and offline training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large. You need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months. However, if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the Internet, or you can go to B station to get many training resources. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me through introduction to get free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning. If you are not a computer major but can pay a certain learning fee and time cost, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, learning is not tiring, and the teacher's explanation is very detailed. If you have questions, there are people dedicated to answering them. Moreover, there is also help in learning planning or supervision. Nowadays, many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal recommendations, and learn after being recommended to go to a company, which can save a lot of things in the interview process for finding a job. Above are my views, because I don't know your situation, so I only give a general introduction and not a detailed one. If you have other questions you want to consult, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.
I said I would be there at 1 point, and I saw it in the App.
What does "我还没说完，你干什么呢？" mean in English?
I, undertaking various services (installation, cleaning, repair) of wall-hung boilers, water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove tops, smoke exhaust fans, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, and professional sewing, as well as domestic services, thank those who have silently given me likes. For the sake of life, we strive and struggle, life is tiring but we must continue, those who like it may follow me, thank those who have silently given me likes. Life is like this, others only see the results, but we go through the process alone, facing life, we have no choice but to persevere, the road can be turned back and looked at but cannot be turned back and walked on... Cleaning is both work and responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, and service is exquisite because of heart and soul. Although we do the dirtiest job of cleaning, we use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home, until we see the customer's satisfied smile and raised thumbs, at that moment, all the hard work is worth it, and the investment will eventually pay off! My daily work - your requirements, my service. Heartfelt service, heartfelt cleaning, preserve the beauty. You care about the details, and Joyful Home Management helps you achieve "cleanliness" that I can do, service with love for the family. Protect every family's cleanliness, tree housekeeping is a milestone, service is in place, cleanliness is at home. Indoor and outdoor cleaning, is my daily work. Crystal lamps are magnificent, but if not cleaned for a long time, they will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly, just like life, if you do things with care, you can succeed, and if you pay attention to the details, you can create exquisiteness. Seamstresses are serious. Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything because professionalism deserves trust, your recognition is what encourages me the most! In today's various industries, it's not easy to do anything! But I always believe that as long as there is a serious attitude, perseverance, and hard work, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who just sit and complain. One day's plan depends on the morning, all the beauty starts from the morning. I hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and a good mood to start a new day. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning. When we were young, happiness was something we had. When we grew up, happiness became a goal we pursued. When we matured, we realized that happiness was a state of mind, and only then did we understand happiness. Be the most real and kindest version of yourself, do things with heart, and you will have no regrets in this life. Life is a journey, walk your own path. Life has two precious things: a healthy body and a good mood, shine brightly and live happily until old age! At every stage of life, we will encounter different difficulties. Often, what binds you is not your ability, but your courage to face difficulties boldly. Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it bravely. The more afraid you are, the more you will be trapped by difficulties. If you meet challenges head-on, problems will eventually be solved.
The curators of the China Central Academy of Fine Arts (UCCA) and the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale Foundation co-organized the first Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia, which was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.  The theme of this year's biennale is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the economic and social transformation period, and also reflects the current state of cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Border Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "The Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create works using recycled materials, such as Ice Zhang's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Stream of Qing Mountains" (2014), which reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.  The executive director of the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale Foundation, Bakry, hopes that this biennale can establish international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand the vibrant cultural and creative industries and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, as well as strengthen interaction and communication. UCCA's director, Feiyu Tan, said, "The goal of the biennale is dual. On the one hand, it aims to let Saudi contemporary art participate in global dialogue, and on the other hand, it aims to let Saudi audiences immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, and artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.
I ordered a cleaver and the restaurant told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver bones. I want to clarify the reason why bones cannot be delivered. Can bones be delivered? Can the restaurant arrange for separate delivery?
However, the system is not very convenient, it is all done through another room.
I am at the branch in Meixinli, which is quite far from where I used to be.

Yunnan: Regulate and Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas-Xinhua Net  Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in assisting poverty-stricken populations in employment and aid, to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, and to promote the development of rural areas, Yunnan Province recently issued policies related to the promotion of rural revitalization and the management of public welfare posts in rural areas, which will assist in comprehensively promoting rural revitalization.  According to the relevant person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts, which are used for the employment of poverty-stricken labor and other disadvantaged rural groups, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment income, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of rural areas to provide various public services.  This new regulation is jointly issued by the Yunnan Civil Affairs, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly standardizes the object scope, fund management, post development, and post management of the recruitment of personnel for rural public welfare posts at the basic level. In terms of post development and setting, the new regulation clearly stipulates that it should be developed according to the principles of "needs-based development, position-based employment, dynamic management, and quota control", "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible", and "one person, one post, voluntary public bidding, and unified management". The recruitment process must be conducted in accordance with the steps of public announcement, application, review, public notice, appointment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.  In addition, the new regulation also clearly stipulates the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare posts, the subsidy standards and methods for rural public welfare posts, and requires the relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare posts. It is stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare posts should purchase commercial accidental injury insurance for the personnel placed in these posts, and that the relevant departments should strengthen supervision of the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare posts.

II. Although the rightists have had their aspirations in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when given a bit of sunlight, but sweat when given a bit of water; they gain momentum when they have a slight advantage, but are easily defeated when faced with setbacks. However, in terms of the actual situation, the rightists have played a positive role in the progress of society. From defining the standard of truth during the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and technological advancement, to promoting the institutionalization of politics and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.  III. As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to them and respect him as a person. He is serious and sincere in his attitude towards China, towards China's social issues, and towards the Communist Party. However, I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic mixture of political factions. Moreover, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation.  IV. To improve or change China, we need patience and a responsible attitude towards the nation. Those who attempt to seek personal gain through political manipulation are not rightists, but scoundrels. Let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of political orphans of their time. If it is said that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the rightist's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary. But the left has nothing of the sort, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!  V. Recently, I have seen some friends mocking anti-thieves while criticizing the left, and they seem to have a lot of energy. I think it's not necessary. It's not worth trying to reason with traitors or the left, because they are both senseless. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to convince anti-thieves and the left to recognize it. Why bother? I tell my friends, when anti-thieves curse you for five yuan, and when the left curses you for being a rightist, it just proves that our middle-of-the-road path is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but forgot about them or pursued them to the point of becoming dogmatic as they grew older. And as they drift further and further away from their ideals, they may end up becoming evil as they grow older. I think left and right are generally about restraint and freedom. China's overall inclination towards the left is due to its historical and cultural genes. Domestic rightists value efficiency and development, while the left emphasizes regulation and safety. Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, and with the competition between China and the US, the left is undoubtedly correct, and it will continue for many years to come. Although it may not make sense, liking it with a thumbs up is enough.
The translation of the given Chinese text into English is as follows:  "I can't wait any longer. I need to place an order now. It's been 2 hours since 19:06 😅"
Today, let's take a look at some "strange" hot searches. What is normal public opinion? We randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd dragon lifts its head, beautiful friend rises in price, and the Laolaoya event. Public opinion spreads and forms waves, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, small peaks may reappear. They look different from the "network public opinion evolution model" displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? We randomly select six hot searches for the same event, presenting a "lonely peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" pattern. The "lonely peak" refers to human intervention to heat up the topic, quickly rising to the top of the hot search list and attracting widespread attention; the "sawtooth" pattern refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search list; the "cliff" pattern refers to collective withdrawal, with the hot search fulfilling its "function" and moving on to a new task or new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of public opinion for one event coincides exactly with the trough of another event, with only a few seconds difference, which must be the result of a unified army of water being assigned a new task and launching a new round of attacks. The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches are simultaneously on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke and lead, which ones shift attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, and which ones influence decision-making. Black PR accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, almost considering all factors in the spread and diffusion of public opinion. Public opinion is a science, and we must abandon subjective factors such as position and emotion and only consider objective data. Black PR will be nowhere to hide without data. Leaving traces is inevitable, and we will dig them out together. Data source: Time Machine for Hot Searches.
Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the COVID-19 virus. Mauritius reported its first two cases of Omicron strain infection on December 10th. According to Mauritius Health Minister Kailesh Kumar Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th, and the other is a local resident who came into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa. Both individuals underwent nucleic acid testing, with positive results on November 30th. After being treated in the hospital and isolating, their nucleic acid test results turned negative, and they have since returned to their respective homes.  On December 10th, the Health Ministry of Cyprus announced the first three confirmed cases of Omicron strain infection in the country. All three individuals are students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of the month. Due to their mild symptoms, they did not require hospital treatment. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the Cypriot government has stepped up its prevention and control efforts. From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all passengers over the age of 12 who arrive in Cyprus by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense upon arrival at the airport. The Cypriot Health Ministry also announced on December 10th that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.  On September 9th, the Health Minister of Malawi, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, announced that the country had identified its first three cases of Omicron strain infection. The country's health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these three cases of infection.

Thinking of having breakfast early, but it's already 7 o'clock and I haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you're saying... Is your Chinese translated or do you prefer to use English?
Shall I call him and tell him?

I called your staff and explained to them.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
Translation:  Great American 360 Integrated Home Decoration Address: Wanjing South Road, 156 Happiness Garden, 12th Floor  At first, it was a friend who introduced me because of trust, so I decided to check it out. Initially, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. When I arrived at the store, a series of tricks began. I was the first-time customer, and they did not even go to the site to measure my house. They claimed that my 135-square-meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan, and they gave me a rough estimate of their materials, which I didn't even know what brand they were. Their second trick was that as soon as you walked into the store, they would try to get you to pay the deposit (once you pay this money, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them). When I was hesitant to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, they would give me a discount. This was a trap, and I fell for it. I paid more than 10,000 yuan in deposit. They gave me a quote with many problems. The 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, or any doors and cabinets, or the bathroom, which are the basic costs. In addition, their service charges were higher than other companies. I lost trust in this company. They didn't tell me anything at the beginning, and they made me sign a contract without any explanation. When I went to get my money back, they acted very experienced, with a special team to deal with me. No matter what, they always blamed the customer, and they had no responsibility at all. They shifted the responsibility in all kinds of ways, and there were many details that I don't even want to talk about. In short, don't choose this company because my friend's house that they renovated was also of poor quality, and they charged all kinds of additional fees. This company is a scam. They used to be called "Dragon Head Decoration," but now they seem to have gone bankrupt and changed their name to "Great American." So, everyone, don't choose these kinds of scam renovation companies. When choosing, please search on Baidu to check these things out because renovation is not cheap. If you want to ask a merchant a question, please log in or register. It is strictly forbidden to post various forms of merchant reviews. For more details, please see the merchant registration statement. The public reviews provide the latest merchant information, including address, phone, and business hours, to help you find a renovation company. If you want to ask a merchant a question, please go to the public reviews.
So terrifying, please cancel the order if it takes less than 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if 15 minutes or less can be canceled.
The fried chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it.
I haven't received a response for 3 days... Because your system is unable to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly plan! The most strange thing is that I use the same credit card every time I pay. I am now being charged for shipping every time. Can you exempt me from the shipping fee until your investigation is complete and then collect my monthly fee? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's already almost 3 o'clock, isn't it time for me to get compensation? I told them to send the package by knocking on the door, but the courier just left it at the door and then left. And it was delivered to the wrong address.
Your delivery rider has already taken my order #NUMBER# for delivery, but is still showing as "waiting". The rider received my order at 19:25, but has not yet left to deliver it. What should I do if I want to place another order? Where has your rider gone? Do I have to wait longer?
I am going to send the package, if you don't cancel it, I will report it.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept the behavior of attacking people physically. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this kind of scoundrel. If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized behavior. From the time you sent me a Facebook friend request and began posting mocking posts, to when you tried to publish what you claimed was my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-response attitude. After that, you became even more brazen, not only constantly tagging me every day, but also discussing ambiguous and slanderous comments about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as comments about my appearance, figure, upbringing, and so on. I...can't take it anymore. Later, I received friend requests from multiple friends on Facebook with a photo of me and comments with sexual harassment content. I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After I reported the news, you did not stop, but became even more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your identity and status in society. In our society, both genders need to be respected. Yes, you can continue to make mocking, ambiguous, slanderous, and abusive comments. You can also continue to claim that you are just caring and concerned about me, and you can even continue to deny that the photos are not yours or continue to post all kinds of attacking comments. I can't stop you, and I don't have the ability to do so. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. Your appearance and figure don't need your evaluation. I don't believe that any woman would allow herself to be humiliated in this way for fame. When my friends asked me if I was okay, I said I was fine, but you wouldn't believe it. I don't think any woman who has been bullied like this would say she was fine. In work, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice will prevail. I have deleted some of the comments for everyone to see. The post you sent should not have been imitated by anyone, right? I can only say that you are a civil enemy. You may laugh.
I have reported and attached a picture, but have not received a reply.
What kind of cow, don't point out the cow, it's a chicken with sour mouth, raw meat can't be eaten.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not leftovers?

"智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit Opens - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Network - China News Service Online On December 10th, the "智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Changsha. Huang Cheng, member of the Hunan Provincial Committee and director of the Hunan Provincial Organization Department, attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech. Huang Cheng pointed out that holding the talent summit is an important measure to implement the central government's talent work conference and the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress, showing that Hunan attaches great importance to talent, seeks talent, and uses talent with sincerity. Hunan has a good tradition of recognizing and loving talents, a broad platform to assist talent development, and a good environment to achieve a better life. In recent years, it has deeply implemented the talent-led development strategy, with the Changsha Talent Action Plan as the guide, to build a talent work pattern covering the entire industrial chain, becoming a fertile land for talent growth, a hot land for innovation and entrepreneurship, and a land of happiness for living and working. Currently, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "three highs and four news" strategic positioning and mission tasks, and will further open the gates to attract and cultivate talents, launch better policies, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions to help talents innovate and start businesses. At the event site, the Changsha, Changsha, and Yueyang Exhibition Centers and the Hunan Free Trade Zone Exhibition Center were set up, and the Hunan Science and Technology Department, the Hunan Industry and Information Technology Department, and the Hunan Human and Social Affairs Department released advanced technology innovation needs lists for the advanced manufacturing industry, talent needs catalogs for the intelligent manufacturing industry, and talent needs catalogs for post-doctoral flow talent in the intelligent manufacturing industry. 48 large enterprises such as China Railway, China United Heavy Machinery, and Far East Technology participated in the on-site recruitment, and nearly a thousand relevant professional graduates and social talents participated in the talent project connection.
Hello I just placed an order, which shows that the courier is waiting at the restaurant, but the restaurant says the order is ready and they haven't seen the courier. Can you help me follow up on this, as it's quite urgent? Thank you.
Without any reason or cause, there is a possibility of being delayed for half an hour. Do you actually have a solution to the problem?

Translation:  Address: No.555, High-speed Railway North Road, Shuibei District View Map The home furnishings here are quite comprehensive, with a variety of brands and well-known brands. During the Double Twelve promotion, go to the "Hansdun" water purifier store to see the water purifiers. The store is having an activity, and the prices are quite reasonable. There are a total of 11 floors in the store, with parking on the 2nd to 9th floors. Parking is free during the day! There are few restaurants and hardware stores around, and the taste of the restaurants is average. The elevator is also quite disappointing. From the 2nd floor to the 1st floor, it goes back and forth without stopping at my floor, and from the safety passage to the 1st floor, it goes directly to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed, and the safety passage cannot be accessed! The store still needs to be improved, as there are many areas that have not been developed. The address is No.555, High-speed Railway North Road, Shuibei District, with convenient transportation and a large parking lot, and parking is free during the day. The environment is spacious, with 8-9 floors, where you can buy furniture, home appliances, and various small items. Many well-known brands have also entered the store, such as Jumbo, IKEA, Hua Di, Lao Ban, Feng Chuang Jia Jia, Hansdun, Ya Ke, You Ban, Xi Lan, Fu Pin Jiu, Wan Jia Le, Da Zi Ran, Zhong Lian, Mei De, Ya Dan... There are too many brands, and it is a good place to buy products, and you can rest on the sofa if you get tired of shopping. Recently, I want to buy a comfortable sofa, and my friend said that there are many sofas to choose from here, but the price is slightly higher, so I am still hesitating. The public provides the address, phone number, and business hours of High-speed Railway Home Furnishings Mall on the mass appraisal platform to help you find decoration companies. Just search on the mass appraisal platform.
