Android hardware Cleaning tip Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers. They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles. I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions. After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair. After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood. After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device. And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions. There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction. Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work... They work very VERY well! After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new. *I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy. De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer. Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor. He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994. De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990. Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election. President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor. "He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees. I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him. A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers. Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions. Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer. De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority. Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police. The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security. Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid. In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing. De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

ASSISTANT: 南非纪念最后一位アパルトヘイト领袖德克勒克南非の日曜日、白人統治の最後の大統領であり、ネルソン・マンデラを刑務所から解放し、アパルトヘイトから民主主義へと国を導いたFWデクラークを正式に追悼しました。デクラークは、がんの闘病の末、85歳でこの世を去りました。彼の名誉のため、国民の悲嘆期間は4日間宣言されました。彼は1989年から1994年まで大統領を務め、白人少数統治から初めて多民族選挙に移行する南アフリカの過程をリードすることで最も記憶されています。デクラークは1990年にマンデラを刑務所から解放し、1993年にノーベル平和賞を共同受賞しました。その後、マンデラは1994年の選挙でアフリカ民族会議（ANC）が勝利し、南アフリカの初めての黒人大統領になりました。大統領のサイモン・ラマフォーサは、日曜日の朝にケープタウンのプロテスタント教会であるグローテ・キルクに出席し、デクラークの名誉を称える演説をしました。「彼はしばしば正確さを超えていたため、よく理解されなかった」とデクラークの妻エリタ・ジョルジアデスは、約200人の出席者に話しました。私はこの男性を忘れることはできません。彼は私を魅了し、私に彼がその大きなタスクを達成するために私に協力することを望むようにしました。デクラークを称えるための私的なミサと国歌、そして2つの蝋燭の間にデクラークの肖像と、白い花で飾られた合唱団が先立ちました。デクラークは国内外で良い評価を受けていたものの、南アフリカでは意見が分かれました。彼の死によって混合された反応が引き起こされました。批評家は、彼がアパルトヘイト時代の犯罪から分離できないと主張し、彼が生きていればそれに対して責任を問われる可能性があったと言

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss. The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier. The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow. All were wearing avalanche beacons. While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion. "Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest. They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour). The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall. The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters). "We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm. People got excited," DeBerry said. "We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk." Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

Hey r/Military! I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries. Hello everyone! I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force. Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29. You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60. In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year. However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission. If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such. I am just wondering how is it for other countries? If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country? What do you guys think about mandatory military service? During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada. Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military. I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well. Sorry for my poor grammar. English is my second language.

ASSISTANT: 嗨，r/Military！我来自一个强制服兵役的国家，我想知道其他国家的情况如何。大家好！我来自爱沙尼亚，我是国家防御力量的一员。在这里，男性从16岁到29岁必须完成8个或11个月的训练，然后被分配到“备役”部队，直到60岁。在这段时间里，防御力量有权要求你每年参加一两次军事演习，每次持续约2周。然而，你不必参加外国任务。如果你想这样做，你必须加入“探险队大队”，那里你将成为一名有薪的专业军人。我只是想知道其他国家的情况如何。如果你在美国或英国加入军队，那么你是否被要求去打别人的国家的战争？你们对强制军事服务有什么看法？在我在Tapa 2018-2019年的训练期间，也有来自英国、美国、法国、比利时、丹麦和加拿大的单位。不幸的是，我们实际上没有太多时间社交，我没有机会问那些人在他们的国家军队中的经历。我知道这个子论坛可能主要是北约成员国，但听取其他（非北约）国家的意见也很有趣。对不起，我的语法不太好。英语是我的第二语言。

I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried. Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills. While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump, I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life. To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward. Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity. That's the thing. Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege. Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist. The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts. But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.

ASSISTANT: 我喜欢这种文章能够帮助揭示社opathic megalomaniac男性的纠结陷阱，我父亲崇拜不尽，以及他谴责的领袖的多数。猜猜尼克松和卡特和他的黄金儿子里根在哪里？而我已经很长时间以来知道这种世界观是完全的谣言，实际上我对凯撒到波拿巴，尼克松，里根，布什和特朗普这些社opathic megalomaniac男性都感到厌恶。但是，我可以欣赏凯撒或拿破仑的历史意义，但是对它们的净化历史让我后来对它们不感兴趣。直到今天，我仍然拒绝学习波兰历史，因为这将只是让我父亲的恐惧论述升级。回到这篇文章，我喜欢小细节提醒你们，有一个好选择（尽管有一些缺陷 - 但大多数情况下是以良好的信仰行事）和一个不好的选择，没有良好的信仰，没有良好的信仰，恶意是解释的更有可能性，而不是愚昧。这就是问题。共和党人喜欢隐藏在愚昧的世界观背后，而不是承认恶意。但是，别忘了，如果一个政党的意识形态受到攻击，那么巧合、巧合等很少存在。受攻击的心态意味着每个行动都必须计算，否则你会浪费有限的能量进行虚假行动。但是，共和党人喜欢隐藏在我们更复杂的世界观背后，并试图抛回各种哲学剑。

Move the trailer! Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop. I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster. No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it. The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something. Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella. The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly). Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster? Me: No, the owner drove yesterday. Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster! Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it. Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there. You know we need to have access to the dumpster. Me: but I didn’t park it there. Why don’t you talk to the owner about it? Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah Me: It was not me. The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way. From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

ASSISTANT: 把货车搬走！几年前，我在一家橱柜厂工作。我和老板一起去了一个安装，回来后他把空货车停在了垃圾桶附近。没有特别的原因，只是那里有空间，所以他就把它留在那里。第二天早上，我来到工厂，杰瑞（不是他的真名）走过来看上去很生气。这不是他唯一的状态，他总是是个有点顿气的老人。对话大致如下（18年前，所以我不记得具体是什么）：杰瑞：你把货车停在垃圾桶附近吗？我：没有，老板开车了。杰瑞：你不能把货车停在那里，我就不能到达垃圾桶！我：我没有把它停在那里，老板开车了，但我可以把它搬走。杰瑞：我不知道为什么你会把货车停在那里。你知道我们需要有访问垃圾桶的空间。我：但我没有把它停在那里。为什么不和老板谈谈？杰瑞：啊啊啊你的错，这些年轻人没有礼貌，啊啊啊。我：这不是我的错。对话一直持续了几分钟，他一直批评我把货车停在我没有停在的地方。从那一天开始，直到我几年后离开那家橱柜厂，每次我在晚上工作（这比较常见），5x8货车在工厂里，我就把舌头抬起来拖到垃圾桶附近，让杰瑞在早上找到它。

All our comics are sent bagged as standard. In addition, the older items are usually boarded as well. The newer items are bagged only. In addition to the above item, we have over 250,000 comics in stock, including both back issues and new items. All our comics are supplied from our real world store enabling us to offer a huge range of comics via auction. We've probably got what you're looking for! (If placing multiple orders, please request an invoice for the correct amount BEFORE paying.) This item is an original American comic and is in English! Please note that all our comics in every grade (EVEN POOR) will be complete unless stated otherwise in the listing! Please take the time to review both the attached cover scan and detailed grade description above to ensure that this particular comic is in the condition you require.

Some of our items include the option to place a best offer. If there is a Best Offer option, we'll consider any reasonable offer. We do not list ANY comics as Mint condition.

EVERY COMIC, even a brand new one, will have some form of minor defect if you get out a magnifying glass and look closely enough. If you are intent on finding comic book perfection, or CGC guaranteed results, it would probably be best to view the comics in person at our store before bidding!

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist. Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said. Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene. A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest. A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes. We still don't know the reason he was killed. A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist. The whole community are shocked. May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents." Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager. Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him. This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances. There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible. We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us. I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why. It's the least Yahya's family deserve." Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10/12/21.

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me. When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause). Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”. I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car. A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental. None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle). None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim. They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage. Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department. I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction. If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

ASSISTANT: 一家位于加利福尼亚州的阿拉莫租车公司对我进行了类似的骗局。当我退还车辆时，代理人发现车子底部有一些刮痕（我并没有造成）。我被迫签署承认“损坏”的文件。我也有视频和照片，但它们没有捕捉到车子底部的损坏。几周后，我回到家后收到了一封信，列出了我需要支付的其他损坏，包括门把手上的刮痕，这些刮痕据说需要在我退还租车的几天后重新涂色整辆车。当时我没有看到这些损坏（或者租车代理人也没有看到）。当我退还车辆时，我也没有拍到这些损坏的照片，所以我争议了这个说法。他们拒绝了我的争议，并要求立即支付损坏费。由于这是一次工作旅行，我把我的照片交给了我们的法律部门。不久后，阿拉莫租车公司发来了一封信，说他们打算宽容地放弃对我的损坏费用的要求，以促进客户满意度。如果我是独自租车的话，我肯定会被迫支付这笔费用，我相信这辆车在我租用期间并没有发生任何损坏。

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions. This isn't even necessarily true. Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS. That's how most apps work now. > Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently. Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough? It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time? And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean? > This is in contrast to Google. Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share. I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps. That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

ASSISTANT: 解耦需要他们确保他们的应用程序在所有不同的 iOS 版本上都能正常工作。这甚至不一定是真的。只需要设置应用程序支持的 iOS 版本的上限，并仅向具有最新兼容 iOS 版本的设备推送更新。这就是大多数应用程序现在的工作方式。> 此外，由于苹果可以频繁发布新的 iOS 和 macOS 版本，因此不是这种频率足够的问题吗？它也导致了一些糟糕的用户体验。即使苹果加快了 OS 更新的速度以处理一些应用程序中的轻微错误，用户为什么每次都需要执行完整的 OS 升级？“开发人员可以确信他们的补丁/功能将在新版本中发布”这句话的含义是什么？> 与 Google 相反。Google 必须解耦，因为在野外有很多 Android 版本，每个版本都占据着巨大的市场份额。我可以肯定地说，如果手机上的 Android 版本一致如 iOS，Google 永远不会为这些应用程序发布这种版本的发行。这是一个大胆的说法，但无论如何，这仍然不解释为什么将应用程序更新与操作系统更新一起打包是对开发人员或最终用户更有利的。

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator. However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: Gabba的双重停电解释及其可能再次发生的风险。澳大利亚协会等待更多关于该体育场的主要升级计划的细节，以适应2032年奥运会的主办权，因此不太可能在下一场阿什赛系列中改善悉尼奥林匹克体育场的电力供应风险。消息人士告诉《艾奇逊晚报》和《墨尔本先驱晚报》，悉尼奥林匹克体育场是澳大利亚协会唯一一个主要体育场，其场地内的主要电力供应不足以启动全球广播趋势所需的广播车和设备。全球广播悉尼奥林匹克体育场测试期间，主要和备用发电机出现故障，导致约25分钟的停电。这是因为该区域的基础电力供应需要为悉尼奥林匹克体育场的灯塔提供电力，其中一个在2019年大联盟比赛中出现故障的灯塔，以及场地本身。因此，广播公司从一台巨大的柴油发电机车中获取其主要电力供应，备用电力应该来自备用发电机。然而，在测试期间，主发电机故障导致备用发电机失效，两者同时停电，导致近30分钟的全部或部分广播图像和DRS丢失。NEP公司，该公司为Fox和七网提供外部广播车和其他设施，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。所有其他将用于阿什赛的场馆（阿德莱德奥林匹克体育场、墨尔本奥林匹克公园、悉尼奥林匹克公园和悉尼奥林匹克公园）将提供主要电力供应，而备用发电机将是柴油发电机。这一差异在过去引起了主办广播公司Fox Cricket的很大焦虑，而在阿什赛测试期间，由于减少的生产和技术人员数量，这一差异得到了加剧。澳大利亚协会在数月内收到Fox的警告，如果继续在悉尼奥林匹克体育场举办比赛，将存在“巨大风险”。

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop. My neighbors got a dog about three years ago. These neighbors and I share a fence. It separates our back yards. Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard. I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc. but this dog is insane. The maintenance guys are afraid of it. So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill. I can't even use my yard at this point. That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop. I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence. Owner says no. I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar. Owner says no. (Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.) Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan. I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*. Like, I saved and invested in this. Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker. There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked. When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up. My speaker shakes the table. It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together. The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays. Edit some grammar errors Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL. This can seriously harm and even kill an animal. Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested. It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit. It sounds great for the money, though. I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

ASSISTANT: 那只不停吠叫的狗以及我是如何让它停吠的。三年前，我的邻居们买了一只狗。这些邻居和我分享一个围栏。这个围栏将我们的后院分开。然而，这只狗咆哮吠叫并试图通过围栏向我咬。我在后院的时候，这只狗一直在咆哮吠叫。我试着忽略它，轻柔地说话，但这只狗疯狂。维护人员害怕它。所以我去探讨邻里的事情，询问他们帮我想办法让这只狗放松一下。我现在甚至无法使用我的院子。这只狗一整天都在外面，咆哮吠叫不停。我问他们是否可以通过围栏给它送一些健康的食物。主人说不可以。我问他们是否可以和我一起买一个不带电击的咆哮狗链。主人说不可以。（注释说我询问邻居至少三次帮助她的狗。) 我感到沮丧，但我还不愿意叫动物控制部门或者其他任何事情。于是我策划了一个计划。我买了一个非常好的便携式扬声器，它很大声。我为此节约了钱，投资了。现在，每次我去后院，我都带着扬声器。这里没有白天噪音限制，我检查过。当这只狗开始咆哮吠叫攻击围栏时，我的邻居们（所有人）都可以享受一些Lamb of God或Rotting Christ或其他极佳的音乐，音量很大。我的扬声器抖动着桌子。邻居们很快就意识到了情况。现在这只狗大部分时间都被锁在房里，当它出来时，它很快就回去了，或者主人陪着它出去。这个社区现在非常安静了。

PSA：不要给狗任何类型的人类药物，例如软糖或晕车。这可能会对动物造成严重的伤害，甚至致死。此外，这个扬声器是来自JYX的便携式PA系统，如果有人感兴趣。它价格低于200美元，但我很穷，所以我需要一段时间才能购买。对于这个价格，它听起来非常不错。我很惊讶，我的邻居也很惊讶。

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list. You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag. A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality. A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance. Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available. Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow. Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one. Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole. The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number. The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood. To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip. Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners. External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying. Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used. Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area. Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering) Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use. Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort. This sleeping bag can be made extra long. Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation. Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe. We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of-the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life. Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop. Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry

ASSISTANT: 当谈到购买质量装备时，睡袋必须是首选。您可以在各种装备上节省，但不能在睡袋上。您在露营或冒险期间大部分时间都会在睡袋里度过，而Snugpak让您放心质量。这是一款经过试验的熟悉的睡袋，这个英国制造的睡袋将微型包装大小与严谨的性能结合在一起。许多人认为Softie 12 Osprey是四季合成填充的最佳睡袋。自1987年以来，它一直在为别人冬季包装大小的性能设定标准。那些了解Softie 12 Osprey的人中，有的使用过它，有的则渴望拥有它。从苏格兰山脉的巅峰到雪洞的底部，Softie 12 Osprey与我们其他睡袋一样，在Softie Original Series中分配了NATO存储编号。睡袋的顶部是裁剪、折叠的，并配有拉环，就像一个外套颈部一样。为了防止双向开锁损伤 zip 边缘或 zip 袋顶部，在 zip 后面缝制了一条“抗卡带”。内部卡扣和挂杆内部提供卡扣以保持荧光线固定，与我们提供的卡扣对齐。外部卡扣使您可以轻松挂起睡袋进行通风和干燥。减小睡袋成圆形脚部，形成“僵尸”形状，易于温暖，并尽量减少使用的材料重量。很难在图片中看到，但全长的 zip 袋在睡袋背面，背后的 zip 区域，以防止热量通过 zip 区域逃脱。购买一个左手和右手，以制作双人床（请在订购时检查）。配备压缩袋，使睡袋在不使用时变小。可以与Snugpak Exanda面板结合使用，以制作更宽的睡袋，提供更多舒适度。这款睡袋可以加长。单层睡袋，有一层Softie填充。Snugpak位于1800年代建造的一个列入文物保护名录的水泥厂，位于英格兰西约克郡的边缘。他们非常自豪是英国甚至欧洲范围内唯一的质量睡袋和隔热服制造商之一。我们在英格兰

I was buying new tires. I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website. I printed out the page and took it to my local shop. It was part of a chain. The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout. Don’t know where he got the higher price from. Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout. He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price. He was gracious about it too. Been buying tires from them ever since.

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words. It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream. Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating. If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir. Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive. I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate). Shipping alone was approx. US$100. I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world. Finally, love your boards! Much respect.

I was scared that Covid was going to be worse. It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough. Still took months for my body to return to normal.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border. He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office. It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday. Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow. Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues. The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there. Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government. The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages. Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner. The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation. Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday. She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage. She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border. Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries. On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels. Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure. His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

ASSISTANT: 德国新总理奥拉夫·席尔茨（Olaf Scholz）周日访问华沙，与波兰总理马特乌什·莫拉韦茨基（Mateusz Morawiecki）讨论了移民、能源、欧盟以及东部地区的紧张局势。他在莫拉韦茨基办公室前被莫拉韦茨基举行军事仪式欢迎。这是席尔茨成立联盟内阁后的其中一次访问。波兰反对由俄罗斯直接向德国输送天然气的北溪2管道，认为这使欧洲依赖俄罗斯的供应，并暴露于莫斯科的压力之下。德国的监管机构因法律问题暂停了对已完成管道的批准程序。华沙政府还与欧盟执行机构欧盟委员会发生了加剧的争端，该机构拒绝向波兰提供疫情恢复基金，因为政府的政策会破坏那里的司法独立。席尔茨和莫拉韦茨基还将讨论德国新政府下的复杂双边关系。尽管友好关系仍受到第二次世界大战的影响，特别是在波兰当前的右翼政府下，但双方仍然保持着良好的邻里关系。波兰政府认为德国应该向波兰赔偿二战期间的损害，而德国的新外交部长安娜莲娜·贝尔博克（Annalena Baerbock）周五访问了华沙。她表示德国支持波兰在东部边境封锁移民，这些移民似乎是由白俄罗斯政府鼓励寻求非法通行。她还呼吁对困在边境上的移民采取人道待遇。波兰和欧盟认为，白俄罗斯总统卢卡申科的政府试图通过鼓励迁徙来破坏欧盟，将移民带入其国家。周五，席尔茨在巴黎会见了法国总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙（Emmanuel Macron），后来在布鲁塞尔会见了欧盟和北约官员。席尔茨，一位中左派政

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays. On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13. These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets. I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it. How come we never saw the main shuttlebay? It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility. Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13. In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life. Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life. Couldn't they have done this on TNG? We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle. We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space. The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect."

ASSISTANT: 《星际迷航：下一代》的星际飞船 The Enterprise-D 拥有三个星际飞船推进器。在节目中，我们总是看到在甲板12和13上的星际飞船推进器2和3。这两个星际飞船推进器由一个全尺寸的摄影棚设置构成，可以容纳全尺寸的星际飞船推进器组。我一直喜欢当集节目展示星际飞船推进器后部的双星际飞船推进器时的场景。为什么我们从未看到主星际飞船推进器？它位于甲板3＆4下方，应该是一个庞大的设施。相反，桥塔船员会直接通过过去它的电梯，而不是去那里。在原始的《星际迷航》中，建造了一个小型的摄影棚，并使用了一个小型的星际飞船推进器来赋生星际飞船推进器。人物有时会在通向星际飞船推进器的门口谈话，门口上的小型摄影棚和星际飞船推进器被重叠以赋予船舶比例和生命力。在TNG中，不是吗？我们在《最佳两种世界，第二部》中看到沃夫和数据从主星际飞船推进器发射飞船，但是飞船发射台的镜头是从飞船内部拍摄的。我们只看到墙外的窗户，飞船飞出，很快被空间替换。除了这两个情况之外，我们从未看到主星际飞船推进器的全规模。我们在《因果关系》中看到一个空拍镜头，主星际飞船推进器的门打开，压缩主星际飞船推进器，我们快速看到里面以及停放的几架飞船。有什么想法可以解释为什么主星际飞船推进器在这两个情况之外从未被看到？

I see it all the time in my line of work. And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating. Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life. Peer to peer failed. Insurance says it’s not medically necessary. We appeal. They say no again. We go to third party appeal. We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure. We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure. 24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No. Not medically necessary.” My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE! But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”. Of course, they don’t. And this kid is screwed. No other option. As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive. We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal. Not this time. The system is so broken.

ASSISTANT: 我经常在工作中看到这种情况。而且即使不是生死关头也会让人感到沮丧。最近有一位患者需要一种特定的膝关节手术才能正常行走并改善生活质量。同行评审失败。保险公司说这不是医疗必要的。我们申请上诉。他们又说不了。我们去第三方上诉。我们提交了所有支持手术必要性的相关医学研究报告。我们甚至附上了另一位不在我们计划内的外科医生的第二个意见——当然，他也建议进行手术。24小时后，他们回复说最终“不是医疗必要的”。我的外科医生失去了耐心，大声说：“好的！但你得告诉我哪个手术我应该推荐，因为我不知道哪个手术能帮助这个孩子。”当然，他们也没有回答。这个孩子就陷入了困境。没有其他选择。最后发现，这种手术通常被保险公司讨厌，因为它很昂贵。我们通常需要为其斗争，但他们通常会在上诉后同意。这次不同了。系统太破旧了。

How was the farewell to Etho was like? First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife. I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P) Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right. Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone. I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak. With that out of the way >.<... So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day. Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc. While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history. Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial. How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts. Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such. Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things. Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms. This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me. What I am after is the other side of the picture? As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff. So how was the response from 'the old gang'? Did you keep doing stuff together? Did you slowly drift apart? Still chat or invite one another to events? Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats. Kinda the opposite. I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt. P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected. That's awesome as heck!

ASSISTANT: 我想问一下，Etho的告别怎么样？首先，我需要说明一点：我不是她的账户用户，而是她的妻子。我有权利使用这个账户，因为我对技术不太擅长，这有助于我的心理健康问题（我确实看到一个技术恐惧症的人问关于红石巨人的问题：P）。其次和远远更重要的说明：我不想引起争端，也不想怀疑有什么不对劲。据我所知，这只是一个风向的改变，不适合每个人。我只是一个老粉丝，满足一下对过去的怀旧情绪。现在说了这么多，>.<... 我曾经是Mindcrack的巨大粉丝，从未错过GuudeBoulderfist的发布，喜欢他们的合作等等。在观看一个随机的YouTube视频时，我发现了一个视频详细介绍了Etho的频道历史。视频的最后涉及到Mindcrack变为商业化。他对这一变化持消极态度，并最终拒绝签署相关合同。再次强调，无论是职业化还是保持休闲状态都不是错误决定，我知道人们会走不同的方向。快速的Google搜索引导我找到了这个旧的帖子，显示了他的观点。从表面上看，你看到了事情的不同方面，但总体上保持了良好的关系。这个整个故事发生在我自己已经转移到其他事情了，所以对我来说都有点新鲜。我想知道故事的另一个方面呢？如我所说，我的心理健康状况不太好，看到一个我曾经热衷于的老团队在没有普遍存在的愚蠢爆炸的情况下分道扬镳，对我来说可能会有一些好处。因此，旧团队的反应是怎样的？你们是否继续做事情在一起？是否逐渐分开？仍然聊天或邀请彼此参加活动？再次强调，我不期望什么戏剧性的事情，也不希望看到人们在彼此的喉咙上。相反，我想看到某种程度上的低调关闭，这对我心理上有些困扰的生活有一些积极的反射。P.S. 我不禁想问一下，你们举办的慈善筹款活动以及你们收集的巨额捐款。这太棒了！

ASSISTANT: 这个宽角扩展管集合可以将镜头转换为宽角镜头。该集合由三个不同长度的扩展管组成，可以任意组合或单独使用以获得不同的放大比例。三个单独的环可以分别与相机主机安装和镜头适配器一起使用，当然，放大比例也会不同。您可以获得8种不同的组合范围。扩展管是由一端有后置镜头安装和另一端有相机主机安装的金属管道组成。扩展管集合不会影响图像质量，因为没有内部透镜。没有电子接触，无法执行自动对焦。曝光和对焦必须手动调整。将相机和镜头设置为手动模式，关闭和分离镜头；在相机和镜头之间插入扩展管，将物体靠近镜头，使用很多光线。当管道附加时，您需要手动操作，并且非常重要的是使用很多外部光线。如果您在亮眼的环境下不这样做，那么您可能会在镜头视图中看不到物体。因此，我们可以立即发货，尽可能快地发货。您需要通过Paypal系统支付。所有显示的银行卡都可以接受。为了方便客户和更快的发货，以下选项可用：皇家邮件1级签名（1个工作日）用于大型和昂贵的物品，皇家邮件跟踪24（1个工作日）用于大型和昂贵的物品，皇家邮件国际跟踪用于大型和昂贵的物品，皇家邮件国际签名用于大型和昂贵的物品。请确保您的订单包含正确的运输地址。我们接受在您购买后60天内的退货。客户满意度对我们非常重要。如果您有订单问题，请与我们联系，我们将尽力使您满意。请不要留下负面反馈。我们保证您的问题将快速解决。只要您对您的购买感到满意，请为我们留下积极反馈。您的反馈对我们非常重要。我们将为您留下积极反馈。如果您有任何问题，请随时通过eBay电子邮件系统与我们联系。我们将尽力在24小时内尽快回复。我们希望您能给我们一个改进服务并解决您可能有的任何问题的机会。

It was prior to 2018. I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening. The counter people were the worst I have ever seen. A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here. I had a confirmed reservation went. After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off. I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away. I swore to never use Avis again. Worst car experience ever. National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me. Those two, followed by Enterprise. Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter. I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague. It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.

ASSISTANT: 这是在2018年之前的一件事。我在宾夕法尼亚州费城被美国航空留在了那里，而不是带我直到新泽西州的纽约市，我和几十个人在晚上努力寻找汽车。服务台的人员是我见过的最糟糕的。有一条排队出门，而她们在休息并谈论一些与工作无关的随意话题，就好像我们并不在这里一样。我有一个确认的预订，但是在等待一个小时之后，我告诉她我预订的是什么，她大声指责我在撒谎她，责备我。我最终放弃了，走过去向哈茨租车，他们收费很贵，但是他们立即给了我一辆车。我誓言永远不会再使用阿维斯。这是我最糟糕的租车经历。国家和哈茨一直对我来说是好的经历。这两家公司，然后是租车公司。租车公司并没有什么特别坏的地方，但它们从来没有像国家那样让我能够走到租车车位上，挑选车辆并立即开车，而不必等待永远的服务台。我知道这些是个人经历，但我会努力告诉每个人避免像瘟疫一样避免阿维斯。良好的客户服务会使客户忠诚，而糟糕的客户体验会失去10倍的客户机会。

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights. The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months. France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year. The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough. Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests. "Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement. The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue. The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26." On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link. Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

ASSISTANT: 法国渔民威胁破坏英国进口，加剧英法鱼业战争 法国渔民威胁破坏英国进口，以强迫伦敦为更多的许可证，随着英法在退出欧盟后的鱼业权利问题上的紧张局势加剧。这一威胁是在周六几个小时后提出的，当时英国同意向法国渔民发放另外23个许可证，以缓和两个邻国之间的紧张局势。法国正在寻求另外81个许可证，以达到在上一年签署的退出欧盟协议中所需的104个许可证。欧盟规定了12月10日为伦敦向法国渔船发放许可证的截止日期，如果没有突破，巴黎将威胁采取欧盟法律行动。强调法国有约80个更多的英国许可证权利，法国北海沿岸的关键港口洛让和其他地区的渔民代表团在周六晚上威胁要发起抗议。 "抗议应该预计...抗议将针对英国进口，"法国北海沿岸CRPMEM渔业产业协会在一份声明中说。该协会表示，其成员对仅发放23个新许可证的消息感到沮丧，感到被欧盟委员会背叛，该委员会可能会采取法律行动对英国提起诉讼。CRPMEM表示，这些抗议将与11月26日在卡昂、圣马洛和奥伊斯特兰港口发生的阻塞港口的方式一致。那一天，法国渔船暂时阻塞了渡轮和其他船只，在卡昂、圣马洛和奥伊斯特兰的港口，而在寻求使用海底隧道铁路连接的车辆也被拦截。自那时以来，双方已经进行了几次谈判，但尚未达成持久的解决方案。

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought. I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither. After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help. Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want? >This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi. This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die. No, it's not. This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller. If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit. Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated. >At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong. We've already done this. Twice. It hasn't stopped them. And it's not like this is harmless. There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots. Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match. How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded? How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know? And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time? I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries. Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations. "Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting. It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress. Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months. The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks. A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks. "The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks. Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance. Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies. Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported. The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord. The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club. Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday. It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground. Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday. The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool. Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat. Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results. Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed. Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

阿斯顿维拉成为最近一支英超俱乐部受到新冠疫情爆发的受害者，俱乐部发现了一些积极感染者。由于此原因，本周日的训练营地Bodymoor Heath的训练被取消了，这是一个仅针对在对阵利物浦后恢复的少数球员的训练。目前看来，这并不是一个严重的爆发，《体育频道》报道称，只有一名球员测试阳性，其余是训练基地的工作人员。阿斯顿维拉将在本周二晚在英超对阵诺里奇城，并没有建议取消比赛，训练也预计将按常规进行。受影响的球员身份尚未确认，也不清楚他们是否在对阵利物浦的比赛中参与。

曼彻斯特联也在周日受到新冠疫情爆发，这个情况似乎引起了更多的担忧，红领队在本周二前往布伦特里的比赛现在被报道为可能受到威胁。 Tottenham Hotspur 已经在新冠病毒中陷入困境，他们在周日对阵布莱克本的比赛被推迟，因为八名球员和五名工作人员的测试结果呈阳性。第二级联赛的西布罗姆和皇later公园球队也受到了爆发的影响，QPR的对阵谢菲尔德联的比赛已经被推迟。新冠奥米克戎变种病毒感染者需要隔离10天，以及与积极感染者有接触的人。

This is a different issue. Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop. It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone. Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be. We treat the disabled like crap. We treat the poor like crap. Everyone in the US should be ashamed. You're correct that our society needs to value human life more. If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down. We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths. Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on. Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS. I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people. It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world. "The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. "People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it." He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it. The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years. It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government. Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more. Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability. "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors. Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days. Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing. The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software. Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software. Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous. New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released. The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said. It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

ASSISTANT: 一个广泛使用的软件工具中发现了一个严重的漏洞，这个漏洞很快成为全球组织的重大威胁。这个漏洞已经被快速利用，在在线游戏Minecraft中被快速利用。Adam Meyers，Crowdstrike的高级副总裁，说：“当前互联网正在大规模火灾中。人们正在紧急修补，各种人正在紧急利用它。”他周五早上说，自漏洞公开以来的12小时内，它已经被“完全武器化”，这意味着恶意分子已经开发和分发了用于利用它的工具。这个漏洞可能是近年来发现的最严重的计算机漏洞之一。它在云服务器和企业软件中广泛存在，这些软件在工业和政府领域广泛使用。如果不修复，它将为罪犯、间谍和程序新手提供易于获取的内部网络访问权限，他们可以掠夺有价值的数据、植入恶意软件、删除关键信息等等。网络攻击现在被视为金融稳定最大的威胁。“我很难想到一家公司不会受到威胁，”Cloudflare首席安全官员Joe Sullivan说。无数服务器上都安装了这个软件，专家表示，影响范围将在几天内公布。Amit Yoran，Tenable的CEO，称其为“过去十年最大、最致命的漏洞”- 可能是现代计算机历史上最大的漏洞。Apache软件基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发负责，该基金会对该软件的开发

Yep…we guys all have guns. Even babies. We all walk around with them like it’s the Wild West. I don’t even know where to begin here. You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo? A crack head is not a “professional mugger.” If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what? Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings. Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it’s not happening. WTF does this have to do with race?

There's a circularity to it... I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition. The math they do is just crazy. "We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness. I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth. Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper. The problem is that we sold out the people below us. I agree with you. Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better. Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus. So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers. But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view. My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic. Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance. On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not. What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child? I dread to think. I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing. For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right. It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020. AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven. Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants. The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization. POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests. Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology. The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants. The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily. As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19. This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed. Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials. The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

ASSISTANT: 分子诊断试验可在20分钟内检测Omicron变异株：报道

韩国研究人员开发了一种分子诊断技术，可以检测Omicron变异株。该技术的研发已完成，预计将需要一段时间才能商业化。POSTECH于10日宣布，由李正旭教授领导的化学工程系研究团队开发了一种分子诊断技术，可以在20-30分钟内检测Omicron变异株，并将结果发布在线。Omicron是一种具有26-32个变异的刺突，刺突是COVID-19病毒用于感染细胞的蛋白质。据研究团队介绍，分子诊断技术可以在单核苷酸基础上区分突变，因此可以检测“隐形Omicron”，这些病毒难以通过PCR测试检测到。目前，韩国疾病控制与预防中心使用三种方法检测COVID-19变异株：整个基因分析、目标DNA（例如刺突蛋白）分析和PCR测试。在Delta变异株的情况下，现有PCR测试可以检测到，但Omicron则不能。本次开发的技术不是阅读DNA或RNA序列的测序方法，而是分子诊断技术。现有技术仅屏幕特定病毒区域，而分子诊断技术被设计为仅在COVID-19RNA存在时引起核酸结合反应，从而实现快速检测。据李教授介绍，Omicron在PCR测试中具有强的N基因信号，但S基因信号较弱。在“隐形Omicron”的情况下，N和S基因均为积极，使其与其他变异株难以区分。分子诊断技术与PCR的作用机制不同，有效检测Omicron变异株。与传统技术一般处理96个样品每台设备的情况下，新技术可以在30分钟内处理超过125个（每小时超过250个样品）。此外，该技术不需要专门的设备，因此可以简单地制作诊断试剂盒。由于该方法可以在4天内开发诊断试剂盒，因此即使未来出现新的变异株或病毒，也可以迅速作出反应。“我希望公开这项技术可以帮助我们尽快恢复正常的日常生活

I told ya so.... The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization. Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was. Needless to say, it was chaos. At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was. I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks? straws?). Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7." Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off. Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there. A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not. He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8. I'll help you find them, ma'am." As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know". Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line. As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her." HA....told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue. My water heater is set pretty low. It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment). Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold. If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath? Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied? Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice! I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick. The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation. It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.

ASSISTANT: 热水器温度和浴室问题。我的热水器设置比较低。它是一个小型热水器，放在一个抽屉里（我住在一个老的预战时期公寓）。问题是，它能够填满浴缸，而不会变冷。如果我每周只洗澡一次（但每隔两天左右洗头），而热水器有足够的水提供快速洗头，那么是否值得提高热水器的温度呢？或者我会节省更多的电力通过在烤锅上加热水，然后将其添加到浴缸中，一旦热水器耗尽？（注释：谢谢大家的建议！我提高了热水器的温度，效果非常好。关于加热不具有效率的评论可能是正确的，因为尽管热水器一直在运行，但这个东西有非常多的隔热材料。它很难到达，所以我留在原来的温度并结束了。）

Iran reports lowest number of daily COVID-19 cases in more than one year Iran's Health Ministry has registered 1,686 new daily COVID-19 infections, the lowest tally over the past 460 days, marking a sharp decline in cases as the fifth wave of the pandemic subsides. According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital. It added that 6,152,524 people in the country have contracted COVID-19 and 5,963,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals. According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units (ICU) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran. Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign. So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots. The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses. Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead.

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only. The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth. I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules. The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course. If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online. Here is the course intro **CompTIA A+ Course Intro**

You know something. I get what Dave's point was. It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people. And of course that's true. But Dave forgot something. Many people who hate trans people also hate black people. He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter. He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric. He's given credibility to transphobia. And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence. He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him. How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.

A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee. So to note, I didn’t witness this. I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job. These two guys came to the store. One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law. After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it. This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door. Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid. When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him. I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle. I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on. But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set. He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

ASSISTANT: 一个小偷的裤子在逃跑时掉下来。需要注意的是，我没有目睹这一幕。我是在我第一份零售工作的同事们告诉我的。有两个人来到了商店。其中一个人在镇上非常闻名，总是与法律有纠纷。经过一段时间的浏览后，这个闻名的人离开了商店，回到了他的车辆，而另一个人拿着购物车，把一套500美元的扳手套放进去。这个伙伴然后等到两个收银员在出口门口忙碌之后，直接走过他们，走出了门。两个人注意到了这一点，问彼此这个人是否支付了。当确认他没有支付时，一个人跑了出去。我被告诉，收银员在追赶他的时候喊道要停下来，但他开始在拖着购物车的扳手套跑，朝着逃跑的车辆跑去。我不知道他是否喜欢佩戴低裤，或者他没有穿着腰带。但我被告诉他的裤子开始掉下来，他在跑步和拖着购物车的时候努力拉起裤子。然后他抛弃了购物车，留下了扳手套，跑到逃跑的车辆上，跳进车内，和闻名的伙伴一起开车逃跑。

I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past. If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs, we might be able to help! Depending on the company. I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by. I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately. I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course. Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!" We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed. Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services. These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons. It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps. Some gyms let you rent lockers. Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.

Amazing. But good on you. Yeah, when I was 16 I applied and got offered a job at a restaurant. Dishwasher. First shift they had me close. Saturday. We were working till past 1am. I quit the next day. Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that. Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot. They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row. He quit. Unless you advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose your workers if you hit them with it too early.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK. They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march. Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year. "All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram. Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it. An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers. UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it. It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade. The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council. The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse." Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city. The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march. A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

在英国布里斯托，渴望购买由神秘街头艺术家Banksy设计的支持推倒雕像抗议者的T恤的人群已经形成了长队。这些限量版“纪念T恤”是为了支持被指控损坏争议性雕像的四名被告而设计的。Banksy在Instagram上写道：“所有收益将用于让被告去喝一杯啤酒。”每件T恤售价为25英镑（约合33美元），加上VAT，限量一件每人，在几家商店销售。由于极大的需求，人们环绕几个街块排队购买。在推特上发布的近两分钟的视频展示了无尽的顾客队伍。英国媒体报道称，“数千”人渴望通过购买灰色T恤来为抗议者筹集资金，该T恤上方写着“布里斯托”。它是关于被推倒的铜雕塑商人爱德华·哥尔斯顿（Edward Colston）的17世纪商人的铜雕塑，他参与了大西洋奴隶贸易。被称为“哥尔斯顿四人组”的活动家将在布里斯托皇家法院下周进行审判，被指控损坏市政委员会拥有的一座丰碑。这四名被告均不认罪。他们被指控在没有合法理由的情况下沉沦雕像。哥尔斯顿的一些人因在死后捐赠给各种慈善机构而受到赞扬，但他的雕像在2020年6月，当布里斯托市举行支持黑人生命运动（BLM）的抗议活动时，遭到攻击。损坏的基座和涂鸦雕像后来被市政委员会从布里斯托海港收回，并作为当地博物馆展览的一部分重新出现，并展示了一组与抗议活动相关的BLM海报。在之前由哥尔斯顿占据的空旷基座上，竖立了一尊BLM抗议者的雕塑。

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states. "We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming. Everything," he said. "And obviously it has some impact here." At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm. The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history." He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate. "All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said. The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change. "As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle. "How are we going to handle this?" he continued. "Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen." Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution. "So we have to act," he said. Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms. "I promise you. Whatever is needed. Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said. He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government. "I want folks in all these states to know. We're going to get through this. We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said. "This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans." The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts. "I do plan on going," he said.

ASSISTANT: 美国总统乔·拜登在周六谴责全球气温升高的失败，并对致命的龙卷风发表讲话。他说：“我们都知道，当气候变暖时，一切都更加激烈。一切都有所影响。”他还表示，至少有30个龙卷风在6个州造成了廣泛的破坏，预计有100多人死于这场风暴。总统表示，他不知道全球变暖对这场致命龙卷风的贡献有多大，他描述其为“历史上最大的龙卷风爆发之一”。他表示，他将派环境保护署调查。“我知道的是，气候变暖对整体天气的激烈程度有所影响，”拜登说。总统赞扬了提出气候变化问题的记者。他说：“正如往常一样，你总是提出最好的问题。”他继续说：“我们该如何处理这个问题呢？”他表示，其中一部分是承认，在继续应对全球变暖的情况下，没有更少的天气灾难的可能性。拜登表示，他对2021年国内的记录性野火感到震惊，表示全球变暖是主要贡献因素。他说：“我们必须采取行动。”拜登表示，第一步是拯救生命并照顾受灾家庭。他说：“我保证你们，无论需要什么，联邦政府都会提供。”他表示，他将仔细监测风暴恢复，并采取联邦政府需要的一切措施。他说：“我想让这些州的人们知道，我们会度过这个困难时期。我们会一起度过这个困难时期，联邦政府不会离开。”他表示，他计划参观受灾地区，但要确保不会干扰当地救援工作。他说：“我打算去的。”

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018. "I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010. "Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series. Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography. Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died. Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage. Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage. I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone. I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case. After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data. After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do. I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable. Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue. Have you experienced this as well?

ASSISTANT: 最近，我从iPhone 12 Pro改到了13 Pro Max，在这两款iPhone上，我都发现了一个漏洞，正在吃掉我的内存。Apple Music的文档和数据占用了约35GB的内存。我尝试通过删除应用程序来解决这个问题，但由于这是一个内置应用程序，文档和数据从iPhone上永远不会被完全删除。我想在新的iPhone 13 Pro上解决这个漏洞，但是这并没有发生。在从iCloud备份中安装后，我检查了Apple Music应用程序，它仍然在使用超过30GB的文档和数据。我联系了两位Apple支持专家，其中一位建议我擦除iPhone并重新开始，另一位则没有提供任何有用的建议，因为该问题超出他们能够处理的范围。我还检查了我的iPad，发现AM在上面只使用了15GB的文档和数据，但这仍然不可接受。现在，我向社区寻求帮助，看看这个问题是否广泛存在，也希望能吸引Apple的关注。你是否也遇到了这个问题？

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2? Specifically 2.10 "Over" Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting. Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this? Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?" A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time. I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations. I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday. Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs. Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time. I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son. He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person! He clearly sucks at damage control. Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

ASSISTANT: 为什么在第二季的第10集“Over”中，斯坦利和沃尔特Jr.对沃尔特在家里工作如此生气？特别是沃尔特替换了热水器，然后替换了一些可能并不一定腐烂的板材。斯坦利为什么对此如此生气？她完全灰心丧气地问道：“你今天还打算去上班吗？”不到一周或两周前，她非常支持他休息和恢复。我知道她在婚姻中不开心，但沃尔特Jr.似乎对沃尔特进行一些翻新工程感到轻微生气并完全困惑。我也知道斯坦利在希望有人能够对她优先考虑一下，而她正在怀孕期间拿着孩子，而沃尔特自从50岁生日以来一直让一切都是关于他自己。然而，我一直觉得很奇怪，在重新观看时，斯坦利和Jr.似乎非常生气沃尔特在家里做些有意义的事情，而不是谎言、杀人或制毒。他只是像一个普通的房主一样，在闲暇时间里修理房子，这是他应该做的。我也知道这只是另一种绝望的尝试，以试图在一天或两天前强迫他的儿子饮用威士忌之后，保留他作为丈夫和家庭成员的角色。他很明显地在夸大一个不是紧急问题的问题，以便让人们觉得他做了一个很棒的工作，是一个很棒的人！他很明显地不擅长处理损害控制。然而，无论如何，他的妻子和儿子的反应仍然总是让我觉得不对劲，似乎是在尝试突出沃尔特的绝望尝试来弥补他的丑陋错误。

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups. It’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples. Ahmad Aubrey’s trial is also an example of positive impact. The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff. However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident. Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization. Transparency is the name of the game. Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country. When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder. Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.

ASSISTANT: 在某些社区中，教会为一些受到迫害的社会群体提供了一个安全的地方。这不是巧合，民权运动与少数教会、清真寺和寺庙紧密相连。阿卜鲁·艾伦的审判也是积极影响的一个例子。撒旦教派也在做一些好事。然而，系统中存在严重问题的例子一直存在。宗教组织和机构应该普遍受到与其他慈善组织相同的标准。透明度是关键。从天主教会的案例来看，可能需要确保这些免税宗教组织获得的资金不离开国家。当我想到宗教会员时，也许合作社模式是有用的；每个会员拥有一票作为股东的利益。希望他们至少为社会保险做出贡献。

I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive. When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!" thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what. I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover. Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down? They'd all have been killed. BUT if they were like "Keep working!" instead of "Take Shelter!", that's different. Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?

Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned. I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300. But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not. If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all. It might just narrow your deficit that one day. An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though? That’s a no go. If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place. Maybe start with 300 deficit. Hope this helps!

ASSISTANT: 是的，这意味着当我锻炼时，我真的不在乎它燃烧了多少卡路里，也不会因为燃烧了多少卡路里而改变我的数字或蛋白质。我会尽量遵循1200-1300。但如果我特别饥饿，那么我会吃些更多的东西来给身体提供燃料，并接受掉重量可能会比一天慢一天。如果你已经做了500卡路里的削减，一些额外的牛排或面包之后也不会对你的进展造成影响。这只是会在那一天减少你的缺口。额外的比萨或冰淇淋呢？那是不可取的。如果你因为锻炼而总是需要吃更多的食物，那么考虑不要在一开始就削减那么多卡路里。也许可以从300卡路里的缺口开始。希望这对你有帮助！

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories. Not much to say here. The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly. I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them. “Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.” To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular. I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on? Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline? “Sure, OP. I am saving money to move.” This is really rare. My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever. Where is she moving? To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry. I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer! It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work. So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city. She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine. Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.

ASSISTANT: 我很久以前在我的办公室的太阳系中发布了一篇关于我办公室的敌人——一个叫PlanetJupiter的女人的故事。这里没什么需要说的。在新冠之前，我最后一次看到她时，她减了一些体重，似乎在吃午饭时注意了一些食物的组合，尽管她仍然使用电轮椅，仍然有些臭。我问她如何，就像我看到任何同事时都会问。“不太好，OP，我发现我患有糖尿病，所以我必须吃少量碳水化合物。” 对于她的一点点功劳，午餐里有花椰菜米代替了普通的米饭。我是一个中西部人，一直都很友好地对待PJ的脸上，所以我告诉她我很抱歉，这很难过，我们两个都在这个项目上工作，我们能按时完成法院的截止日期吗？“当然，OP。我正在为搬迁节省钱。” 这其实非常罕见。我的州拥有历史上最低的人口外流率。她要搬到哪里？另一个中西部城市，那里有很多与牛业有关的工作。希望她没有被误认为是一头公牛！结果，我和其他人记录了她的慢/差工作、桌上睡觉、惹人厌烦以及臭味，导致她在除了一家外的所有公司都错失了合同工作的机会。因此，她必须搬到那个城市的家人那里。她将在另一个工作场所破坏光阴，但至少不会再破坏我的工作场所。毕竟，现在我拥有了一份更好的远程职位。

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago. Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act. Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence. Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement. Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations. Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement." All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground. Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out. It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns. We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again. We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said. Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019. Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU. "We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure. The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said. Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring Got just the one Christmas tree? Then you could be behind the times. This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring. More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol. Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia. Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours. Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself." British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites. Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees." Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more. Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep." Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber. Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response. In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state." He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era. "Christmas can be a pretty stressful time. A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things. That is always good for sleep."

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates. France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates. Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table... We also signed the contract with the Greeks. Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon." The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates. The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning. Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty." This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

ASSISTANT: 法国回应美国对希腊驱逐舰的竞争性提议

法国和希腊的防务部门均确认，美国的竞争性提议将不会影响已经“签署”并“最终”的数十亿美元购买法国Belharra驱逐舰的协议。法国国防部周六表示，与雅典的防务协议已经“几天前初步签署了”，在美国国务院宣布批准潜在销售美国驱逐舰之前。由于我们一直在与希腊人交谈，美国的提议已经不再有效了...我们也签署了协议。希腊的防务部门也确认，与巴黎的协议是“最终的”，因为它已经在“最高层次”上进行了谈判，并由希腊总理凯里亚科斯·米托塔基斯“个人宣布”。最终的协议报告将待希腊议会“很快”的批准。美国国防安全合作局周五表示，已经批准了69亿美元的四艘洛克希德·马丁战斗驱逐舰的销售，以及一个25亿美元的项目，用于升级希腊的MEKO级驱逐舰。该公告引发了一些关于雅典-巴黎协议的担忧，特别是在9月，在长期存在的法国-澳大利亚潜艇建造“世纪协议”突然被法国、澳大利亚和美国签署的AUKUS协议撤销后，没有任何提前通知。愤怒的巴黎指责华盛顿和堪培拉进行了“背叛”，而马克龙仅在两周后与希腊总理一起上台宣布至少三艘法国战舰出售给雅典，价值约35亿美元，说是时候“停止天真”，并将新协议视为“欧洲战略自主和主权”的象征。这一次，根据法国军队，美国“已经告诉我们，这个公告即将发布”，而美国人“没有意愿进一步销售他们的驱逐舰”。

Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders. I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question. I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc. I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question. He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping. He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily. I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone. I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it. He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away. How was I supposed to have known he needed help? He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite. This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help.

Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation. Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings. Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power. There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow. Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported. A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall. Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital. Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency. The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes. Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road. Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said. Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow. The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas. An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning.

We had power go out a couple of times. Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately. They are security now. Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands). Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there. Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again. Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave. As well as every cart brought to the front. Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce. Step 6: Return said cold/produce. Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc. Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out. (Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go). It's really dark, even upfront. No way can we let customers just hang out. I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't. Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay. I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later. One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on. They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen. I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could. Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.

ASSISTANT: 我们经历了几次停电。步骤1：立即派人站在门口。他们现在是保安。不要让任何人进来，并注意人们离开时的情况（特别是孩子们的手）。步骤2：如果他们不在，就打电话给店长。步骤3：那些在收银台前的人以及其他人可以等待几分钟，看看备用发电机是否可以再次启动我们。步骤4：在整个商店里让每个非员工离开。以及将每个购物车带到前面。步骤5：在购物车里寻找任何冷食品和生产品。步骤6：将所有冷食品和生产品归还。步骤7：覆盖所有没有门的冷食品，例如奶酪/肉/蔬菜等。步骤8：在离开时在一张纸上签名，以便记录出场时间。（有些人被允许早退，特别是那些不舒服在黑暗中或还有6小时工作时间的人）。前面非常黑暗，绝对不能让顾客盯着等待。我不确定为什么有些收银台仍然有一些电力，而其他收银台则没有。不确定，但我认为我们没有任何方法让他们支付。我认为物品可以扫描，但我们绝不能信任顾客后续支付。有一次，仅需要3小时的时间，电力就恢复了。他们让我们保留几个人，如果电力如他们说的那样应该恢复，那么我们可以重新开放。我没有问题，只要我们有选择可以留下或离开，尽可能地保存产品，我就没有问题。但是没有选择的权利，以及危险顾客的情况，那就是我的界限。

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced. "We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic." He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE. The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy. "If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated. According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list. In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week. According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys. After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game. When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks. The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning. Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury. The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity. This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players. Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups. It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88). Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands. Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts. We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area. Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."

ASSISTANT: 达拉斯牛仔队将椅子带到华盛顿，对手关系愈发激烈。访问阵营在华盛顿的赛场看起来对达拉斯牛仔队来说非常熟悉。在得知其他球队称赛场的赛场席位需要升级的消息后，牛仔队决定为这场对抗赛准备自己的席位。当他们到达球场时，他们已经穿上了牛仔队的标志和字体。牛仔队得知，最近在周一晚上对阵华盛顿的圣地亚哥队投诉称，加热席位出现故障。本周早些时候，牛仔队的运动员埃兹基尔·埃利奥特（Ezekiel Elliott）也评论了在寒冷的户外比赛中的好处，因为加热席位对于他的膝盖伤势有益。牛仔队只是确保了埃利奥特和他的队友能够享受这个机会。这个行动是达拉斯-华盛顿对抗关系的最新转折点，这个关系本周更加激烈了，因为牛仔队的主教练迈克·麦卡锡预测他们会赢得比赛，引发了华盛顿的罗恩·里弗亚和球员之间的火花。华盛顿在两场比赛中击败了牛仔队。这是30多年来首次在三场比赛中连续击败达拉斯（1986-88）。牛仔队的球迷人数占到了华盛顿球场的观众中的一半以上，这可以从看台上的蓝白球衣来看出来。拥有球队的拥有者杰瑞·琼斯在本周早些时候在达拉斯的105.3 FM电台上说过，“我们一直在销售更多的牛仔队帽子、帽子、T恤。我们一直在华盛顿以外的地方拥有最大的粉丝支持，无论你计算的是什么。华盛顿以外的地方，我们在所有可能计算的事情中都拥有最大的支持。”

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life' Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected. The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning. The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings. Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services. It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country. More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27. Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7. STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row. The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute. "Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said. A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland. "This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said. "It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime. For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."
