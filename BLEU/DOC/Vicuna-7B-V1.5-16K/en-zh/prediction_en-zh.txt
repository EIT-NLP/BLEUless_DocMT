Android hardware Cleaning tip Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers. They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles. I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions. After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair. After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood. After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device. And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions. There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction. Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work... They work very VERY well! After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new. *I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy. De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer. Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor. He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994. De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990. Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election. President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor. "He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees. I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him. A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers. Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions. Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer. De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority. Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police. The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security. Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid. In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing. De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

ASSISTANT: 南非为逝去的最后种族隔离领袖德克勒克致敬意。德克勒克于去年11月1日因癌症去世，享年85岁。为了纪念他，南非宣布四天的国家哀悼期。他于1989年至1994年担任总统，最為人们難忘的是引領南非从种族隔离統治走向多元選舉。德克勒克与邁克爾·曼德拉共同获得了1993年的诺贝尔和平奖，在1990年释放曼德拉之后。曼德拉随后成为了南非的第一位黑人总统，当时他的非洲国民大会党赢得了1994年的选举。总统拉马喬斯在周末早晨在开普敦的一个长老会教堂——南非最古老的教堂——为德克勒克致敬意发表演讲。“他经常被误解，是因为他过于谨慎”，德克勒克的妻子埃利塔·乔治亚迪斯在大约200人的听众面前说。我永远不会忘记这个人，他迷住了我，让我想帮助他完成这个巨大的任务。在仪式之前，有私人祈祷和国歌演唱，仪式中摆放着德克勒克的画像在两束烛旁，陪伴着一个装饰着白花的合唱团。尽管在国际上有积极的评价，但德克勒克在南非引起了不同意见。批评者认为他仍然与种族隔离时期的罪行无法分离，如果他还活着，他可能会受到更长时间的责任。德克勒克代表了国民党，在1948年正式建立了种族隔离和南非非白人多数群体的投票权。在教堂外，一小组抗议者拿着“正义被拒绝”和“对种族隔离受害者的正义”的横幅，很快被警察带走。周围地区关闭了交通，并加强了高安全措施。在最后几年，他的言论也使德克勒克的形象受到了批评，因为他未能正式道歉

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss. The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier. The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow. All were wearing avalanche beacons. While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion. "Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest. They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour). The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall. The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters). "We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm. People got excited," DeBerry said. "We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk." Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

ASSISTANT: 华盛顿州滑雪度假村发生冰川事件，1人死亡，5人受困 An 冰川在华盛顿州滑雪度假村的一部分冰川滑雪区域发生，导致一名60岁男子死亡，并且暂时困住了五名其他人。该冰川在周六上午10:50分在Crystal Mountain的Silver Basin区域发生，该区域位于华盛顿州的85英里（137公里）东南方向，Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss说。死者的身份尚未公布，但据报道，他在被救出雪后呼吸停止，尽管接受了另一名滑雪者的心肺复苏尝试，仍然不幸去世。受困的其他滑雪者受到了两名目击者的帮助，他们被冰川冲刷。所有人都佩戴着冰川信号器。尽管这些人都是经验丰富的后园滑雪者，但警告已经发布，建议不要在该区域滑雪，该区域位于Crystal Mountain Resort的范围内。私人滑雪度假村决定了冰川的状况，但没有什么可以阻止滑雪者前往那里，因为该区域与公共土地接壤。Crystal Mountain的总裁和首席执行官Frank DeBerry表示，所有六名男子都持有滑雪度假村的上山旅行通行证，这意味着他们与滑雪patrol参与了如何和在度假村财产内的方式进行后园滑雪的指导，并且必须在前往冒险之前检查雪况。“滑雪者可以在国家森林上的任何地方自由滑行。他们曾经进入了森林，但最终回到了度假村的范围之内，这是这次冰川发生的地方。”DeBerry说。除了关闭发生冰川事件的区域外，该度假村早上还关闭了Mt. Rainier Gondola，因为风速达到了100英里每小时（161公里每小时）。这次冰川发生在季节的首个重大雪fall之中。该区域至周日早晨受到暴雪警报，国家气象局表示，高于2000英尺（610米）的地区可能会降下12到15英寸（38厘米）的雪。“我们的季节迟

Hey r/Military! I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries. Hello everyone! I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force. Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29. You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60. In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year. However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission. If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such. I am just wondering how is it for other countries? If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country? What do you guys think about mandatory military service? During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada. Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military. I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well. Sorry for my poor grammar. English is my second language.

ASSISTANT: 嗨 r/Military！我來自一個國家，軍事義務是強制性的，我只是想知道其他國家的情況。大家好！我來自愛沙尼亞，我是國家防衛力量的一份子。在這裡，軍事服務是強制性的，從16至29歲的男性必須完成8或11個月的訓練，然後被派往“預備單位”，直到您變60歲。在這段時間內，防衛力量有資格要求您參加每年大約2周的軍事演習。但是，您不被強制前往外國任務。如果您想做到這一點，您必須加入“探險營”，那麼您將成為一名專業軍人，並且會有薪水等等。我只是想知道其他國家的情況。如果您在美國或英國加入軍隊，那麼您是否被強制前往另一個國家？您們對強制性軍事服務有什麼看法？在我在塔帕（2018-2019）進行訓練時，還有來自英國、美國、法國、比利時、丹麥和加拿大的單位。不幸的是，我們並沒有太多時間聊天，也沒有機會問那些人們在他們國家的軍隊服務的情況。我知道，這個subreddit可能主要由NATO成員組成，但從其他（非NATO）國家也很有興趣聽到他們的看法。抱歉我的語法不好。英語是我的第二語言。

I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried. Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills. While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump, I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life. To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward. Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity. That's the thing. Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege. Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist. The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts. But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.

Sunday Best: Enter 1880s New York in HBO's "The Gilded Age" Hat and parasol alert! "The Gilded Age," created by Julian Fellowes ("Downton Abbey") and written by Fellowes and Sonja Warfield, premieres next month on HBO. Set in 1880s New York, it follows Marian Brook (Louisa Jacobson, above left) and aspiring writer Peggy Scott (Denée Benton, right) as they newly encounter old-money society. Also in the cast are Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector, among many more. Good fun for the winter, no?

Move the trailer! Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop. I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster. No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it. The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something. Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella. The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly). Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster? Me: No, the owner drove yesterday. Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster! Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it. Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there. You know we need to have access to the dumpster. Me: but I didn’t park it there. Why don’t you talk to the owner about it? Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah Me: It was not me. The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way. From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

ASSISTANT: 请将以下文件从英语翻译成中文。将拖拽车！几年前，我在一家木工店工作过。我和老板一起去安装时，回来后他将空的拖拽车停在了垃圾桶附近。没有特别的原因，只是那里有空，所以他就把它停在那里。第二天早上我来到工作，Jerry（不是他的真名）来到我身边看起来很生气。这不是新鲜事，他总是一个烦恼的老头。对话类似于下面的内容（18年前，所以我不太记得具体情况）：

Jerry：你在垃圾桶附近停了那辆拖拽车吗？

我：不，昨天老板开车了。

Jerry：你不能在那里停拖拽车，否则我就无法到达垃圾桶！

我：我并没有在那里停拖拽车，你知道我们需要到达垃圾桶吗？

Jerry：但你为什么会在那里停拖拽车？你知道我们需要到达垃圾桶吗？

我：但我并没有在那里停拖拽车。你为什么不直接和老板谈一谈呢？

Jerry：哈哈哈，你的错，这些年轻人没有尊重，哈哈哈，你的错，哈哈哈……

我：这不是我的错。这样的对话持续了几分钟，他一直批评我留下拖拽车的方式，尽管我并没有留下拖拽车的方式。从那一天开始，直到我离开那家木工店几年后，如果我在晚上留下的5x8拖拽车在店里，我就会拿起车钩把它推到垃圾桶附近，让 Jerry 早上找到。

In addition to the above item, we have over 250,000 comics in stock, including both back issues and new items. All our comics are supplied from our real world store enabling us to offer a huge range of comics via auction. We've probably got what you're looking for! (If placing multiple orders, please request an invoice for the correct amount BEFORE paying.) This item is an original American comic and is in English! Please note that all our comics in every grade (EVEN POOR) will be complete unless stated otherwise in the listing! Please take the time to review both the attached cover scan and detailed grade description above to ensure that this particular comic is in the condition you require. Most of our listings offer Multi-Buy discounts. Usually starting at 3 or more items to gain the discount. The items can be ANY combination of ANY ITEMS included in the Multi-Buy. They DO NOT have to be multiple copies of the same item. Just pick the required total quantity and you'll automatically be given the discount on all of them!

EVERY COMIC, even a brand new one, will have some form of minor defect if you get out a magnifying glass and look closely enough. If you are intent on finding comic book perfection, or CGC guaranteed results, it would probably be best to view the comics in person at our store before bidding!

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist. Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said. Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene. A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest. A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes. We still don't know the reason he was killed. A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist. The whole community are shocked. May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents." Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager. Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him. This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances. There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible. We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us. I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why. It's the least Yahya's family deserve." Anyone with any information should call 101, quoting reference number 3643 10/12/21.

侦查人员正在收集CCTV和其他证据，试图揭示发生了什么事情，并确定和追溯那些杀害这名青年男孩的人。侦查人员Hannah Whitehouse（Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse）表示：“雅哈亚只有18岁，他的未来已经被夺走了，这是最可悲的情况。目前没有一个明确的动机可以解释这次攻击，我们正在全力以赴地寻找和追溯那些负责这一事件的人。我们已经与许多证人交谈，但我们仍需要听取任何有关情况的信息，以帮助我们。我呼吁那些在当时出现的人，做正确的事情，告诉我们他们发生了什么，以及为什么。这是雅哈亚家庭所应得的最少。”

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me. When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause). Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”. I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car. A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental. None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle). None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim. They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage. Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department. I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction. If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

ASSISTANT: 一家位于加利福尼亚州的阿拉莫汽车租赁店对我进行了类似的骗局。当我退还汽车时，代表发现汽车下面有划痕（我没有造成的）。我必须签署承认“损坏”。我也没有拍摄汽车底部的视频和照片。几周后，当我回到家时，我收到了一封信，列出了我还要为其他损坏承担的费用，包括在我退还汽车几天后划痕后需要刷新汽车尾部的门的划痕。这些损坏对我来说是不可见的（或者代表在退还汽车时我和代表都没有看到）。这些损坏也不在我退还汽车时拍摄到的照片中，所以我就争辩了这个索赔。他们拒绝了我的争辩并要求立即支付损坏费用。由于这是一次工作旅行，我将我的照片交给了我公司的法律部门。我几天后收到了阿拉莫的一封信，说他们计划免除这些费用，以满足客户满意度。如果我独自一人，我肯定会最终被迫支付这些费用，因为我肯定这些损坏并没有在我护理汽车期间发生。

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions. This isn't even necessarily true. Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS. That's how most apps work now. > Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently. Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough? It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time? And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean? > This is in contrast to Google. Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share. I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps. That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

ASSISTANT: 解耦将需要他们确保他们的应用在所有不同的iOS版本上都能正常工作。这并不一定是真的。他们只需要为应用支持的iOS版本制定上限，并仅对具有最新兼容版iOS的设备推送更新。现在大多数应用都是这样工作的。
> 此外，考虑到苹果可以频繁地发布新的iOS和macOS版本，不是问题吗？甚至即使苹果增加了修复少量应用的小错误的OS更新频率，为什么用户每次需要进行*完整的操作系统升级*呢？而且“开发者可以在新版本中推送他们的补丁/功能”这句话是什么意思呢？

> 

与谷歌不同，谷歌需要解耦，因为在智能手机上存在许多Android版本，每个版本占有庞大的市场份额。我可以没有疑问地说，如果智能手机上的Android版本像iOS一样一致，谷歌永远不会为这些应用发布与操作系统版本一起发布的应用。这是一个大胆的肯定，但无论如何，它仍然不能解释如何将应用更新与操作系统更新打包起来对开发者或终端用户更好。

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator. However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop. My neighbors got a dog about three years ago. These neighbors and I share a fence. It separates our back yards. Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard. I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc. but this dog is insane. The maintenance guys are afraid of it. So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill. I can't even use my yard at this point. That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop. I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence. Owner says no. I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar. Owner says no. (Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.) Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan. I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*. Like, I saved and invested in this. Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker. There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked. When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up. My speaker shakes the table. It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together. The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays. Edit some grammar errors Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL. This can seriously harm and even kill an animal. Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested. It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit. It sounds great for the money, though. I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list. You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag. A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality. A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance. Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available. Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow. Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one. Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole. The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number. The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood. To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip. Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners. External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying. Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used. Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area. Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering) Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use. Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort. This sleeping bag can be made extra long. Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation. Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe. We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of-the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life. Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop. Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry

ASSISTANT: 针对购买质量设备的问题，睡袋应该是首要考虑的。你可以在各种设备上節約，但不能在睡袋上節約。很多时间在野餐或探险中将会在睡袋里度过，与Snugpak你可以保证质量。一款经过试验和验证的英国制造的睡袋，将微型包装大小与严格的性能结合在一起。许多人将Softie 12 Osprey视为最佳四季 synthetic 填充睡袋。自1987年以来，它已经成为跟随其他冬季大小性能的标准。那些知道Softie 12 Osprey的人，其中有些人已经使用过一个，也有些人曾经渴望拥有一个。从苏格兰山脉的高处到雪洞的底部，Softie 12 Osprey就像我们其他Softie原始系列睡袋一样，被分配了一个NATO车辆编号。睡袋的镶嵌式顶部是精细打剪、裁剪和附有拉绳的，就像一件外套帽子一样拉成形状。为了防止两端拉链从拉链隔断带或睡袋边缘撕破，在拉链后面安装了一条“防撕破带”的网带。弹簧固定和挂杆环子内部标签提供以保持松紧弹簧的位置，与我们提供的弹簧固定系统中的标签对应。外部标签允许你轻松地把睡袋挂起来以降温和晾干。将睡袋剪成圆形脚部，以创建“船形”，易于温暖并减少使用材料的重量。很难在图片中看到，但拉链从一端到另一端覆盖整个睡袋，位于拉链后面，以防止热泄漏通过拉链区域。购买左侧和右侧手来制作双人睡袋（请在订购时核实），附带一个压缩填充袋，当不使用时可以让睡袋变得更小。可以使用Snugpak Exanda面板来制作更舒适的更宽的睡袋。这款睡袋可以制作得更长。单层睡袋，由一层Softie填充

I was buying new tires. I found the ones I wanted on a tire store website. I printed out the page and took it to my local shop. It was part of a chain. The guy at the shop checked things out and it turns out that the current price of the tires was more than my printout. Don’t know where he got the higher price from. Luckily, the guy was honest and rather than trying to charge the higher price, he sold me the tires for the price I had on my printout. He said that because I had the printout, he had to sell me the tires at the printout price. He was gracious about it too. Been buying tires from them ever since.

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words. It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream. Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating. If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir. Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive. I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate). Shipping alone was approx. US$100. I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world. Finally, love your boards! Much respect.

I was scared that Covid was going to be worse. It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough. Still took months for my body to return to normal.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border. He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office. It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday. Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow. Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues. The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there. Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government. The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages. Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner. The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation. Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday. She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage. She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border. Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries. On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels. Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure. His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays. On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13. These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets. I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it. How come we never saw the main shuttlebay? It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility. Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13. In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life. Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life. Couldn't they have done this on TNG? We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle. We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space. The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect." We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles. Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?

ASSISTANT: 《星际舰队：下一代》的车库 The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays. On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13.

I see it all the time in my line of work. And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating. Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life. Peer to peer failed. Insurance says it’s not medically necessary. We appeal. They say no again. We go to third party appeal. We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure. We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure. 24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No. Not medically necessary.” My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE! But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”. Of course, they don’t. And this kid is screwed. No other option. As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive. We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal. Not this time. The system is so broken.

ASSISTANT: 我经常看到这种情况在我的工作中。它甚至不需要是生死关头才会让人感到沮丧。最近有一位患者需要一种特定的膝部手术来正常行走并改善生活质量。同行评审失败。保险公司认为这种手术不是医学必要的。我们提出上诉。他们再次拒绝了我们。我们去了第三方上诉。我们提交了所有相关的医学研究，支持这种手术的需要。我们甚至包括了一位不在我们的计划中的不同外科医师的意见——对啊，他建议这种手术。24小时后，他们回复说“不是医学必要”。我的外科医师感到非常生气，他像这样说：“好吧，但你会告诉我你会推荐哪种手术，因为我不知道另一种会帮助这个孩子”。当然，他们不会。而这个孩子现在处于困境。没有其他选择。事实上，这种手术通常不受保险公司的欢迎，因为它相当昂贵。我们总是要战斗才能获得它，但他们通常会在上诉后同意。这次不是。这个系统真的很破碎了。

How was the farewell to Etho was like? First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife. I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P) Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right. Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone. I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak. With that out of the way >.<... So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day. Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc. While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history. Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial. How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts. Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such. Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things. Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms. This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me. What I am after is the other side of the picture? As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff. So how was the response from 'the old gang'? Did you keep doing stuff together? Did you slowly drift apart? Still chat or invite one another to events? Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats. Kinda the opposite. I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt. P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected. That's awesome as heck!

ASSISTANT: 如何评价 Etho 的告别呢？首先要说明一下，我不是帐户的用户，而是她的妻子。我有权利使用这个帐户，因为我对技术很不擅长，这有点帮助我缓解情绪问题（而且我也看到了这种技术排斥者要求关于红石巨人的情况的幽默：P）。其次和更重要的声明是，我不想引发沉默，也不想怀疑有什么不对劲的事情。据我所知，这只是风向变化，不适合每个人。我只是一个老粉丝，满足了一种情怀上的渴望。现在就让我们讨论 Etho 的告别了。

以前我是 Mindcrack 的粉丝，从 GuudeBoulderfist 开始，从未错过任何发布。我喜欢它们的协作，等等。在浏览一个随机的 YouTube 流媒体时，我发现了一个视频，详细介绍了 Etho 的频道历史。在视频的末尾，它提到了 Mindcrack 变得商业化。他认为这并不是一种积极的看法，以及不可避免的拒绝与相关合同签署有关的决定。再次说，不选择职业化也不是错误的决定，我知道人们有各种各样的方向。快速搜索引起了我对这个论坛的兴趣，这里展示了他的观点。总的来说，我知道需要谨慎说话，但从表面上看，最令人印象深刻的是你看到了事情的不同方面，但总体上仍保持了良好的关系。这个故事发生在我自己转向其他事情后，因此对我来说都是新鲜的。我想知道是另一个角度的故事。正如我所说，我的心理健康并不优秀，看到一个我曾经非常依赖的小团队分道扬镳，没有任何愚蠢的爆炸，这在极端的公共讨论中很少见，对我来说可能会有一些慰藉和积极的影响。所以，“老团队”的反应如何？你们是否仍在一起做事？你们是否渐渐远离？还在聊天或邀请彼此参加活动？再次说，我不期望任何戏剧化的情况，也不希望看到人们互相指责。毫无

It was prior to 2018. I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening. The counter people were the worst I have ever seen. A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here. I had a confirmed reservation went. After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off. I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away. I swore to never use Avis again. Worst car experience ever. National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me. Those two, followed by Enterprise. Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter. I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague. It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.

ASSISTANT: 在2018年之前，我被美国航空降落在费城，而不是直接带我前往纽约，我和十二个其他人都在晚上努力寻找车辆。检票人员是我所见过最糟糕的。门口排队，他们在休息和谈论与工作无关的随意话题，就像我们不在这里一样。我有确认预订，但在等待一个小时后，我告诉她我预订的是什么，她大声地指责我向她撒谎，并批评我。我最终放弃了，走到了赫尔茨，他们收取了一大笔费用，但他们立即给我一辆车。我向永远不再使用Avis这个公司保证。最糟糕的车辆体验。国家航空和赫尔茨一直给我带来了良好的体验。这两个，接下来是Enterprise。Enterprise并没有在任何方面很糟糕，但它们从来没有像国家航空那样方便，我可以走上去选择车辆，驾车离开检票台，而不必等待很长时间。我知道这些经历是随机的，但我会尽力告诉每个人避免Avis如难避免。事实上，良好的客户服务会让客户保持忠诚，而一个差的客户体验会驱使十倍的客户机会离开。

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights. The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months. France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year. The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough. Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests. "Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement. The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue. The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26." On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link. Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

ASSISTANT: 法国渔民威胁破坏英国进口业务，因为他们试图通过向伦敦要求更多渔业许可证来压迫英国政府。这一威胁是在英国同意向法国渔民颁发另外23个许可证之后提出的，这些许可证旨在缓和法国和英国之间因渔业争端而陷入僵局的紧张关系。这一威胁发生在周六凌晨几个小时之后，英国同意向法国渔民颁发另外23个许可证，以缓和两个邻国之间因渔业争端而陷入僵局的紧张关系已经持续了六个月。法国正在寻求获得另外81个批准，以使其渔船能够在英国和欧洲海岛水域内运营，这是根据去年签署的《脱欧协议》。欧洲联盟已经设定了2021年12月10日的截止日期，要求伦敦向法国渔船颁发许可证，如果没有突破口，巴黎威胁将采取欧洲法律行动。强调法国有权要求约80个英国渔业许可证，一个代表布洛涅-sur-Mer等北部港口的渔业产业组织表示，该组织的成员因听到仅颁发23个新许可证而感到痛苦，并觉得欧洲委员会背叛了他们。CRPMEM表示，这些渔民将按照在布列塔尼、诺曼底和北部法国举行的堵路抗议的方式进行抗议，这些抗议将涉及英国进口。该组织表示，其成员对仅颁发23个新许可证感到痛苦，并觉得欧洲委员会可能会对英国政府提起法律行动。CRPMEM表示，这些抗议将遵循2021年11月26日在布列塔尼、诺曼底和北部法国举行的堵路抗议的方式。在那一天，法国渔船简单地堵住了卡尔顿海峡的渡轮和其他船只，车辆也被派往堵塞尝试使用欧洲铁路隧道的交通。

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought. I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither. After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help. Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want? >This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi. This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die. No, it's not. This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller. If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit. Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated. >At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong. We've already done this. Twice. It hasn't stopped them. And it's not like this is harmless. There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots. Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match. How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded? How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know? And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time? I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

ASSISTANT: 这些内容在受到任何批判性思维的曝露时会萎缩。我不会排除那些不实践批判性思维的广泛群体的可能性，但无论如何，证明其错误并不能保证它们会萎缩。事实上，我们已经进行了一次审计和手动重新计算这些选票，但这并没有帮助。我们应该继续允许他们“审计”选票直到他们获得所需的结果吗？
> 这就像是让尤里·葛埃尔试图在詹姆斯·兰迪的面前做魔术。这是故事的结束，谎言的死亡。不，这不是。这是尤里·葛埃尔试图在詹姆斯·兰迪的面前做魔术，不喜欢结果，并雇佣一家公司的CEO声称他相信葛埃尔的力量是真实的，以“研究”他的力量并调查兰迪是否是一个共产党员，试图破坏葛埃尔。如果这里没有结果，他们会要求进行另一次审计。或者他们会声称烧毁的选票被喂给了被烹饪的鸡肉，然后被烧毁。

在某个时刻，你必须对现实进行实际的检查，并将其与他们的想法进行比较，指出它们是错误的。我们已经这样做了。两次。它们仍然没有停止。并且这不是无害的。已经有了关于这些人可能违反联邦法律，不正确地保护选票的指控。在那篇文章中还提到了这家公司计划physically canvas部分马里卡普县的地区，询问人们的选票是否与他们的选票相匹配。你自己如何感觉，如果有人来问你上次选举中你是否投票给了某个候选人，并且如果你不告诉他们，你的票可能会被标记并丢弃？你是否确信这家公司会保护这些数据的隐私，而不让其他社区的人知道？你是否更有可能投票，如果你知道这是每次投票的可能性？我知道很多人会不这样做。

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries. Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations. "Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting. It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress. Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months. The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks. A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks. "The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks. Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance. Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies. Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported. The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord. The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

ASSISTANT: 时间即将耗尽，德国表示时间即将耗尽，要求恢复2015年世界大国与伊朗的核协议。德国外交部长在英国利物浦举行新闻发布会时表示，伊朗在最近的谈判中恢复了一个将谈判推迟六个月的姿态。目前在维也纳进行的谈判是在五个月的停滞之后，伊朗新总统埃布拉姆·拉伊西当选后恢复的。早些时候，美国官员表示，安东尼·布林肯国务卿在上周五与英国、德国和法国的同事进行了一次“有效”的会议，讨论了伊朗谈判的方向。一名美国国务院高级官员表示，G7国家之间的对话非常紧张，他们在核谈判的重要性上是一致的。“我们将在声明中强调，获得伊朗重新加入谈判的可能性，并且我们相信可以达成协议，但时间正在缩短，所以我们是一致的。”高级官员透露，美国伊朗事务特使罗伯特·马利是返回维也纳进行谈判的。伊朗官员之前表示，他们将维持坚定的立场。在原始核协议中，美国总统唐纳德·特朗普于2018年放弃该协议，伊朗限制了其核项目，以换取美国、欧洲联盟和联合国的缓解制裁。西方国家担心该项目将用于制造武器，伊朗则否认。拉伊西在周六表示，伊朗在维也纳进行核谈判诚实，官方伊朗新闻机构IRNA报道。美国和伊朗间的间接谈判，由法国、英国、德国、俄罗斯和中国的外交官代表双方进行，因为伊朗拒绝与华盛顿直接接触。双方的目标是使双方都恢复遵守协议的全部合作。预计G7会议将发表一份呼吁，要求伊朗缓和其核项目，并抓住维也纳谈判的机会。

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club. Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday. It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground. Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday. The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool. Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat. Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results. Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed. Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

This is a different issue. Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop. It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone. Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be. We treat the disabled like crap. We treat the poor like crap. Everyone in the US should be ashamed. You're correct that our society needs to value human life more. If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down. We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths. Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on. Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS. I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people. It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.

ASSISTANT: 这是一个不同的问题。美国的残疾人没有得到待遇好，这是不可否认的。这不仅与收入或独居有关，而且服务和对残疾人和贫困人群的考虑都远远不足以应有。我们对残疾人和贫困人群的待遇都很糟糕。所有美国人都应该为此感到羞愧。您正确地指出，我们的社会需要更加尊重人类生命。如果我们这样做，就会看到大规模枪击案件频率降低，交通事故和死亡人数也会减少。医疗保健和儿童护理将变得易于获得，以及其他方面。不幸的是，美国社会已经“接受”了艰苦、死亡和其他损失的统计数据，作为“生活方式”的交换，以换取“自由”或某种类似的BS。我看到您关于您残疾并未得到支持的评论，这只是美国不支持人们的另一个例子。它与作者的观点在同一轨道上，而不是存在冲突。

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world. "The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. "People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it." He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it. The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years. It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government. Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more. Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability. "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors. Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days. Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing. The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software. Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software. Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous. New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released. The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said. It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

Yep…we guys all have guns. Even babies. We all walk around with them like it’s the Wild West. I don’t even know where to begin here. You honestly think that a crackhead would own an expensive gun, and then save up enough money for ammo? A crack head is not a “professional mugger.” If you don’t hear of people being stabbed, so what? Stabbings don’t get the same press treatment as shootings. Just because the press doesn’t highlight something doesn’t mean it’s not happening. WTF does this have to do with race?

There's a circularity to it... I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition. The math they do is just crazy. "We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness. I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth. Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper. The problem is that we sold out the people below us. I agree with you. Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better. Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus. So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers. But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view. My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic. Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance. On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not. What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child? I dread to think. I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing. For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right. It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020. AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven. Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants. The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization. POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests. Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology. The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants. The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily. As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19. This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed. Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials. The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

ASSISTANT: 分子診斷測試可以在20分鐘內檢測Omicron變異毒株：報告韓國研究人員發展了分子診斷技術，可以檢測Omicron變異毒株。技術開發已經完成，但還需要時間才能商業化。POSTECH在10日宣布，由化學工程系教授李榮福帶領的研究團隊發展了一種能夠在20-30分鐘內檢測Omicron變異毒株的分子診斷技術，並將在網上發表結果。Omicron是一種使用COVID-19病毒感染細胞的觸角的變異毒株，其中有26-32個變異。根據研究團隊，分子診斷技術可以區分單一核苷酸基因的變異，因此可以檢測"Stealth Omicron"，這些變異很難被PCR檢測法檢測到。目前，韓國疾病管制署正在使用三種方法來檢測COVID-19變異毒株：整個基因序列分析、目標DNA（如觸角蛋白等變異）分析和PCR檢測。在Delta變異的情況下，目前的PCR檢測法可以檢測到它，但Omicron則不能。這次開發的技術不是一種讀取DNA或RNA序列的序列方法，而是分子診斷技術。現有技術僅對病毒的特定區域進行屏蔽掃描，而分子診斷技術則設計為在COVID-19RNA存在的情況下導致核苷酸結合反應，實現快速檢測。根據李榮福教授，Omicron在PCR檢測中具有強烈的N基因信號，但具有較弱的S基因信號。在"Stealth Omicron"的情況下，N和S基因都確認為陽性，使其與其他變異難以區分。分子診斷技術的作用機制與PCR不同，有效地檢測Omicron變異毒

I told ya so.... The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization. Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was. Needless to say, it was chaos. At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was. I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks? straws?). Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7." Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off. Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there. A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not. He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8. I'll help you find them, ma'am." As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know". Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line. As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her." HA....told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue. My water heater is set pretty low. It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment). Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold. If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath? Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied? Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice! I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick. The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation. It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.

ASSISTANT: 水暖器温度和浴缸问题。我的水暖器设置比较低。我住在一个小房间里（我住在一栋老旧的历史风格公寓里）。问题是，它是否能够完全填满浴缸，而不是变冷。如果我每周只洗一次（但每两天或以此类推地洗澡），而且水暖器有足够的水，那么是否值得将温度提高，以便在每周一次洗澡时使用？或者我是否会节省更多的电力，如果我在水暖器空闲时将热水加热锅放入浴缸中？

编辑：谢谢大家的建议！我稍微提高了温度，并且解决了问题。关于采热效率低的评论可能是正确的，因为即使水暖器一直在不断運轉，那個東西有如此多的隔熱材料。我很難去调整，所以我将温度保持不变，并宣布结束。

Iran reports lowest number of daily COVID-19 cases in more than one year Iran's Health Ministry has registered 1,686 new daily COVID-19 infections, the lowest tally over the past 460 days, marking a sharp decline in cases as the fifth wave of the pandemic subsides. According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital. It added that 6,152,524 people in the country have contracted COVID-19 and 5,963,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals. According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units (ICU) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran. Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign. So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots. The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses. Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead. According to the latest figures, eight cities are in the orange zones, 119 in the yellow category, and 321 cities are in blue zones. There is no city in the high-risk red zone.

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only. The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth. I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules. The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course. If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online. Here is the course intro **CompTIA A+ Course Intro**

ASSISTANT: 免费 CompTIA A+ 培训 | 将涵盖全课程

我现在正在提供免费的 CompTIA A+ 课程培训。该课程包括 18 个模块，我将为每个模块做一个独立的视频。其中一些视频可能会比较长，因为每个视频将会涵盖整个模块，所以请您如有需要，可以使用视频描述中的时间戳，如果您只想查看特定主题，或者只想回顾某些主题。时间戳是为了让您的生活变得更容易而设置的，因此如果您最终变成一个疯狂地在模块之间左右的人，寻找失落的牙齿，那么这是您自己的错。我将为此课程做 20 个视频，第一个是 4 分钟的介绍视频，介绍课程，最后一个是一个专门的考试策略视频，然后当然是 18 个视频中的模块。培训应该足够通过 CompTIA A+ 的国际考试以及我提供的其他课程也应该足够通过相关考试。如果您对课程中某个模块的特定主题有疑问，或者对整个课程的问题需要更多的澄清，请随时向我提问，我会尽力帮助您，如果我在线。以下是课程介绍 **CompTIA A+ 课程介绍**

You know something. I get what Dave's point was. It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people. And of course that's true. But Dave forgot something. Many people who hate trans people also hate black people. He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter. He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric. He's given credibility to transphobia. And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence. He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him. How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.

ASSISTANT: 你知道，我明白 Dave 的意思。殺死黑人比嘲笑跨性別人更糟糕。當然，這是真的。但是 Dave 忘了一件事。許多討厭跨性別人的人也討厭黑人。他沒有贏得任何人對 #blacklivesmatter 的支持。他只是給跨性別人的敵人提供了另一個英雄和更多反跨性別言論。他給跨性別恐懼給予了可信度。而考慮到最脆弱的跨性別人是黑人跨性別女性，他將他們變成了暴力的目標。他因為意識到白人正在嘲笑他而離開了他的節目。他沒有意識到他對跨性別人做了完全相同的事情非常可悲。

A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee. So to note, I didn’t witness this. I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job. These two guys came to the store. One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law. After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it. This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door. Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid. When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him. I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle. I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on. But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set. He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past. If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs, we might be able to help! Depending on the company. I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by. I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately. I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course. Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!" We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed. Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services. These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons. It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps. Some gyms let you rent lockers. Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.

Amazing. But good on you. Yeah, when I was 16 I applied and got offered a job at a restaurant. Dishwasher. First shift they had me close. Saturday. We were working till past 1am. I quit the next day. Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that. Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK. They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march. Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year. "All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram. Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it. An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers. UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it. It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade. The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council. The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse." Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city. The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march. A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

长队购买Banksy的T恤支持雕像破坏抗议者

在英国布里斯托尔，人们急于购买由神秘街头艺术家Banksy设计的限量版T恤，以支持在黑人生命事件抗议中被起诉的破坏雕像的抗议者。Banksy设计的限量版“紀念T恤”旨在纪念去年在布里斯托尔受到争议的雕像破坏案的审判。“所有收益将捐赠给被告人，以便他们去喝啤酒”，艺术家在Instagram上写道。这件T恤售价为25英镑（33美元）加增税收，并限制每个人只能在几家商店购买一件，因此人们排队了几个街区才能购买它。一个几乎持续两分钟的Twitter视频展示了一个无尽的顾客队伍。英国媒体报道称，“数千人”希望通过购买这件灰色T恤来为抗议者筹集资金，这件T恤描绘了一个空白的基石，上面写着“布里斯托尔”。它指的是被抗议者摧毁的17世纪贸易奴隶贸易的雕像。被称为“Colston四人”的抗议者将在下周在布里斯托尔皇家法院受审，被指控毁坏属于市议会的文物。这些男人 - 他们都否认罪名 - 被指责在没有合法理由的情况下摧毁这座雕像。虽然有人赞扬他在去世后留下了各种慈善事业的钱，但备受争议的贸易商的雕像在2020年6月被攻击，当时在布里斯托尔市中心举行的一次支持黑人生命事件的抗议活动正在进行。损坏的基石和涂鸦雕像后来由市议会从布里斯托尔港口捡回，并在混乱中抛弃，最终重新成为当地博物馆的展品，并与一个精心策划的BLM海报展览一起出现。一尊BLM抗议者雕像被放置在曾经被Colston佔據的空白基石上。

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states. "We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming. Everything," he said. "And obviously it has some impact here." At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm. The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history." He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate. "All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said. The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change. "As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle. "How are we going to handle this?" he continued. "Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen." Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution. "So we have to act," he said. Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms. "I promise you. Whatever is needed. Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said. He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government. "I want folks in all these states to know. We're going to get through this. We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said. "This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans." The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts. "I do plan on going," he said.

ASSISTANT: 乔·拜登哀悼无法制止全球变暖导致死亡性龙卷风破坏 President 乔·拜登在周六晚上哀悼世界无法制止全球变暖，他在强烈龙卷风袭击多个州的情况下发表演讲。“我们都知道，当气候变暖时，一切都更加剧烈。一切，”他说。“当然，它对这里产生了一定的影响。”至少有30个龙卷风在六个不同的州出现，引发广泛的破坏，预计超过100人将死于这场暴风雨。总统表示，他不知道全球变暖对这场猛烈龙卷风的死亡性影响的全部范围，他描述这场“历史上最大的龙卷风爆发”。他表示，他将要求环境保护局进行调查。“我只知道，气候变暖对所有天气的强度都产生了一定的影响，”拜登说。总统称赞那个问他关于气候变暖的记者。“总是问最好的问题，”他用幽默的笑声回答。“我们应该如何处理这个问题？”他继续说。“其中一部分是认识到，在继续努力应对全球变暖方面没有进展的情况下，天气灾害的发生概率会减少，这根本不会发生。”拜登表示，他对于2021年国内纪录规模的野火感到震惊，表示全球变暖是其重大贡献。“所以我们必须采取行动，”他说。拜登表示，第一步是拯救生命和关心受到龙卷风破坏的家庭。“我保证，无论需要什么，联邦政府都会提供它，”拜登说。他表示，他将密切关注龙卷风恢复的情况，并根据联邦政府的需要采取任何措施。“我希望所有这些州的人都知道，我们会一起经历这个，联邦政府不会撤退。”他说。“这是一个时候，我们不是民主党人或共和党人。”总统表示，他计划访问灾害区域，但只要不会阻碍当地救援行动，他就会前往。“我打算去，”他说。

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018. "I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010. "Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series. Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography. Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died. Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

ASSISTANT: 《吸血鬼陷阱》作者安妮·雷斯（Anne Rice）在80岁时逝世。据克里斯托弗·雷斯（Christopher Rice）透露，雷斯因脑损伤引起的并发症导致逝世。雷斯的最大成功是1976年出版的首部小说《吸血鬼陷阱》，该小说引入了吸血鬼勒斯塔（Lestat）这个角色，后者成为了13本《吸血鬼系列》（The Vampire Chronicles）中的中心人物。2018年出版的最新书《吸血鬼陷阱》中的勒斯塔。在2010年在南伊利诺伊大学的一次演讲中，雷斯说：“我想勒斯塔是一个行动型人物，一个可以做我无法做的事情的人物。”《吸血鬼陷阱》于1994年改编成成功的电影，帮助重新激发了吸血鬼类型的兴趣，这一兴趣继续在电视剧《吸血鬼日记》和《泰坦之光》电影系列中继续。虽然她大部分时间生活在加利福尼亚州，但雷斯在新奥尔良出生并在那里成长，并在她的网站生活传记中提到了她的许多故事。雷斯的儿子克里斯托弗·雷斯（Christopher Rice）表示，他在母亲逝世时旁边。安妮·雷斯将在私人仪式中安葬于新奥尔良，公众纪念仪式计划在明年举行，他说。

Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage. Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage. I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone. I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case. After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data. After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do. I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable. Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue. Have you experienced this as well?

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2? Specifically 2.10 "Over" Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting. Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this? Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?" A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time. I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations. I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday. Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs. Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time. I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son. He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person! He clearly sucks at damage control. Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

ASSISTANT: 为什么在第二季的2.10集中，Skyler和Walt Jr.对Walt在家里修理房屋感到很生气呢？具体来说，在这一集中，Walt更换了热水器，然后更换了看似不一定腐烂的板材。Skyler为什么这么生气呢？她已经完全失望，甚至问：“你今天还要上班吗？”几周前，她对他休息和恢复整个时间都很热情。我知道她对婚姻感到不满，但Walter Jr.似乎有些厌烦和完全感到困惑地看着Walt在做一些修缮工作。我也知道Skyler正在公开追求Ted，希望有人将她视为一个优先考虑的人，因为她正在怀上孩子，而Walt自从他的50岁生日以来一直将所有关注都放在自己身上。但是，我一直觉得在重新观看这个剧集时，Sky和Jr.对Walt在家里做一些积极的事情感到非常生气，而不是躺着或者杀人或制作毒品。他只是像家主人一样维护房屋，没有任何额外的时间。我也知道这只是另一种绝望的尝试，试图以任何方式来保持他作为丈夫和家庭人的角色，尽管几天前迫使他的teenage儿子喝一杯威士忌。他显然试图通过强调一个不是立即优先事项来展示自己做得很好，是一个很好的人！他显然很糟糕地进行损坏控制。无论如何，他的妻子和儿子的反应总是让我觉得不对劲，且在这种情况下强行试图突出Walt的绝望努力。

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups. It’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples. Ahmad Aubrey’s trial is also an example of positive impact. The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff. However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident. Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization. Transparency is the name of the game. Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country. When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder. Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.

ASSISTANT: 在某些社区，教堂为一些受到迫害的社会群体提供了一个安全的地方。这并不是巧合，民权运动与少数教堂、清真寺和寺庙之间非常紧密地联系在一起。阿卜杜勒·阿赫马德的审判也是积极影响的例子。毁灭教派也在做出积极的贡献。然而，在任何系统中出现明显错误的例子总是存在的。宗教组织和机构通常应该与任何其他慈善组织相同的标准受到考虑。透明度是游戏的关键。考虑到天主教会的案例，建议确保这些受税免除的宗教组织获得的资金不会离开国家。当我想到宗教成员时，可能使用合作社模型是有用的；每个成员作为利益相关者获得一个单独的投票权。希望他们至少为社会保险贡献一些东西。

I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive. When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!" thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what. I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover. Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down? They'd all have been killed. BUT if they were like "Keep working!" instead of "Take Shelter!", that's different. Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?

ASSISTANT: 我认为他们可能在告诉他们不要开车，但我不知道他们是否确实告诉他们不要离开。当龙卷风变得如此紧急时，天气预报员通常会发出“立即避难！”的警报，因为你不知道它会在两分钟或十分钟之内发生。我不知道他们有权力实际禁止人们离开，但我可以想象他们会告诉人们采取避难措施。可以想象那些人在龙卷风落地后努力离开停车场吗？他们都会被杀吗。但是，如果他们说“继续工作！”而不是“避难所！”，那就不同了。任何人知道他们是在工作还是在某个地方避难吗？

Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned. I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300. But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not. If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all. It might just narrow your deficit that one day. An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though? That’s a no go. If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place. Maybe start with 300 deficit. Hope this helps!

ASSISTANT: 当我锻炼时，我真的不在乎它燃烧了多少卡路里，我也不会因为燃烧了多少而改变我的卡路里或蛋白质摄入量。我（尝试）遵循1200-1300的范围，但如果我很饿，我会吃些东西来燃料我的身体，并接受体重损失可能会一天晚一些，或者不会。如果你已经减少了500卡路里，一次难度大的锻炼后额外吃一片牛肉或甚至是面包，完全不会浪费你的进步。它可能只是缩小了那一天的缺陷。额外的一份披萨或冰淇淋？那是不行的。如果你因为锻炼而总是需要吃更多，那么考虑不要在第一时间减少太多卡路里。也许从300卡路里的缺陷开始。希望这对你有所帮助！

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories. Not much to say here. The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly. I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them. “Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.” To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular. I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on? Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline? “Sure, OP. I am saving money to move.” This is really rare. My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever. Where is she moving? To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry. I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer! It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work. So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city. She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine. Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago. Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act. Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence. Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement. Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations. Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement." All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground. Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out. It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns. We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again. We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said. Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019. Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU. "We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure. The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said. Several organisations, including AASU, North East Students' Organisation (NESO) and Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), had observed "black day" on December 11 to mark two years of the passage of CAA in Parliament.

ASSISTANT: 阿萨反CAA组织为在抗议中死亡的人民举行了哀悼活动。两年前，阿萨反CAA抗议中有五名抗议者死亡。几个组织在阿萨的周日为在两年前反CAA抗议中死亡的五名抗议者举行了哀悼活动，并决定重新恢复对该法案的抗议运动。在抗议者之一Sam Stafford的家中举行了纪念活动，参与者决定再次加强对公民身份（修改）法案的抗议。农民解放斗争委员会（KMSS）是在国会通过该法案后首个组织反CAA抗议的组织之一，在Stafford的Hatigaon家中为抗议者举行了哀悼活动。Sibsagar议员Akhil Gogoi，他在抗议中曾是农民解放斗争委员会的领袖，并因在抗议中的作用被监禁，在纪念照片上举花时表示，政党和“民族主义组织”必须领导恢复抗议运动。谈到2019年抗议中的艺术界，他说：“我们不能期望他们组织抗议。他们的帮助非常重要，但他们不应该因为没有重新恢复运动而受到责备。”另一个关键角色的阿萨学生联合会（AASU）在Hatigaon高中学校体育场举行了一个纪念活动。在这个场合上，AASU主任顾问Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya说：“错误地说，反CAA抗议已经死亡。由于开始考试（2020年1月），然后疫情和封锁，它失去了紧张程度。我们将再次以全力恢复抗议。我们不会让这些牺牲无功而返。”Bhattacharya表示，反CAA抗议将再次成为一场整个东北印度的抗议，就像在2019年一样。知名歌手和音乐制作人Zubeen Garg，在阿萨学生联合会组织的活动上也为抗议者举行了哀悼活动。“我们不会接受CAA，这是肯定的。政府试图迷惑我们，但我们不会让他们让我们接受它。”

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring Got just the one Christmas tree? Then you could be behind the times. This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring. More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol. Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia. Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours. Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself." British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites. Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees." Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more. Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep." Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber. Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response. In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state." He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era. "Christmas can be a pretty stressful time. A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things. That is always good for sleep."

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates. France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates. Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table... We also signed the contract with the Greeks. Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon." The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates. The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning. Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty." This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

ASSISTANT: 法国对美国向希腊出售驱逐舰的竞争性提议表示抗议。法国和希腊的国防部都确认，美国的竞争性提议将对已经“签署”和“最终”的多亿美元购买法国Belharra驱逐舰的合同产生 no 影响。法国国防部在星期六宣布，与雅典就国防合同已经“几天前”初签，在美国国务院宣布批准潜在出售美国驱逐舰之前。自我们与希腊进行谈判以来，美国的提议不再在讨论中。我们还与希腊签署了合同。希腊国防部也确认，与巴黎的协议是“最终的”，因为它已经在“最高层次”进行谈判，并由希腊总理宣布。据报道，希腊议会即将“很快”批准最终化合同。美国国防安全合作机构在星期五宣布，已经批准出售4艘Lockheed Martin战斗驱逐舰，以及单独出售25亿美元的MEKO级驱逐舰升级计划。这一宣布引发了对雅典-巴黎协议的一些担忧，特别是在9月份，澳大利亚与法国签署的潜艇建造“百年协议”突然被AUKUS协议摧毁，没有任何预警。愤怒的巴黎指责华盛顿和堪培拉，而仅仅两周后，马克龙在与希腊总理同台发表演讲，宣布将至少销售三艘法国战舰给雅典，以约35亿美元的价格，说明是时候“停止天真”，同时强调新协议是“欧洲的战略自主和主权的象征”。这次，据法国军方称，美国“已经警告我们这一宣布将会出台”，并且美国人员据称“没有意向进一步”地实际出售他们的驱逐舰。

Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders. I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question. I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc. I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question. He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping. He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily. I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone. I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it. He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away. How was I supposed to have known he needed help? He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite. This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help. He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.

Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation. Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings. Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power. There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow. Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported. A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall. Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital. Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency. The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes. Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road. Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said. Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow. The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas. An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning.

ASSISTANT: 塞尔维亚和巴尔干地区受到重大暴风雪破坏 Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation. Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings. Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power. There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow. Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported. A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall. Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital. Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency. The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes. Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road. Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said.

We had power go out a couple of times. Step 1: Get someone on the door immediately. They are security now. Don't let anyone in and pay attention to people as they leave (esp kids' hands). Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there. Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again. Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave. As well as every cart brought to the front. Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce. Step 6: Return said cold/produce. Step 7: Cover all non-doored cold i.e. cheese/meat/veggies, etc. Step 8: Sign our names on a sheet of paper as we left to be clocked out. (Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go). It's really dark, even upfront. No way can we let customers just hang out. I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't. Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay. I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later. One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on. They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen. I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could. Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.

ASSISTANT: 我們有幾次電力發生故障。第一步：立即找一個站在門口的人。他們現在是保安。不要讓任何人進入，並且要注意人們當他們離開（尤其是孩子的手）。第二步：如果他們不在，請聯繫商店經理。第三步：該處負責收錢的人和其他任何人都可以等待幾分鐘，以查看是否可以使用備用發電機重新啟動。第四步：穿梭整個商店，讓所有非員工離開，以及所有帶到前台的購物車。第五步：檢查購物車中的冷凍食品和蔬菜。第六步：將所有冷凍食品和蔬菜歸還。第七步：覆蓋所有非門口的冷凍食品，例如芝士、肉類和蔬菜等。第八步：在離開時簽署一張紙張，以記錄我們的出勤時間，以便我們被計時工作。（有些人被允許早退，尤其是如果他們不舒服在黑暗中工作，或者還有6小時要工作）。真的很暗，甚至在前台也很暗。我們不能讓顧客在那裡徘徊。我不確定為什麼有些貨架仍然有電力，而其他貨架則沒有。我不確定，但我認為我們沒有任何方法可以讓他們付款。我認為商品會掃描，但我們絕對不能信任顧客後來付款。有一次，電力恢復只需要大約3小時。他們讓幾個人留下，因為為了滿足發電公司的要求，如果電力真的恢復，我們可以重新開業。我不介意，只要我們有選擇是否留下，並且我們能夠儘可能地保護產品，就好。不

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced. "We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic." He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE. The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy. "If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated. According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list. In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week. According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys. After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game. When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks. The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning. Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury. The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity. This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players. Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups. It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88). Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands. Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts. We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area. Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life' Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected. The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning. The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings. Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services. It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country. More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27. Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7. STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row. The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute. "Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said. A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland. "This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said. "It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime. For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."
