觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证 这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！ 普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。 众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。 这个时候便是需要急救的时候。 如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！ 所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！ 当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。 “在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。 在美国全国是平均15%能救过来。 在拉斯维加斯的赌场酒店，百分之七八十能救过来，上海、北京低于1%。” 这是第一反应创始人陆乐说的。 如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸没有了，心跳没有了，你掐人中是没有任何作用的。 必须做人工呼吸、胸外按压才有可能把人救过来。 我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。 说不定还能挽救一个人的生命！ 急救证可以在你们当地的红十字会培训中心报名，我是在珠海的红十字会培训中心报名的，学生还有优惠呢。 PS：最后一张图是记录自己25岁前要完成的目标的，把急救证加入目标清单也是几个月前的事情，但是确实是完成了呀！ 接着要去考其他想考的证书了，打算去考个潜水证，之前在小红书看到还有个潜水急救证，考这个证好像还得有急救证才可以去考，所以其实急救证还是很有用的！

ASSISTANT: This is a certificate that I think is very meaningful - a first aid certificate. It is one of the skill certificates that I think are important besides my driver's license! Let's popularize it: Emergency first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be performed before the ambulance arrives in the event of an emergency. As everyone knows, there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the process of coming to the scene of an accident. It is precisely this period of time that is the most critical. This is the time when emergency first aid is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest, then the window for saving my life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes! Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know emergency first aid! When someone collapses nearby, we can perform emergency first aid using professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly doing nothing, which is too terrifying.

According to the founder of the first responders, in China, we have official data of 3 million people dying from accidents every year, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest. In the United States, only 15% can be saved on average. In Las Vegas casinos, 78% can be saved, and in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%.

The founder of the first responders said that if someone has sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save them. I found that we still have few people who have the awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill. Maybe we can save a life! The first aid certificate can be registered at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There are also discounts for students.

PS: The last photo is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turned 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals is something I did a few months ago, but I have completed it! Next, I plan to take other exams I want to take, such as a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving and first aid certificate, and it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take the diving certificate. Therefore, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

ASSISTANT: The Chongqing Municipal Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system. Starting from this year, 60 vocational schools in the city will adopt the modern apprenticeship model for talent cultivation, and students who are admitted will be pre-recruited as employees by the pilot enterprises. The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and pilot enterprise trainees should be clarified. Apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who are over 16 years old but under 18 years old, the agreement must be signed by the apprentices, their legal guardians, the schools, and the enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits for on-the-job training. The commission encourages pilot schools to conduct pre-employment training and on-the-job training in cooperation with partner enterprises using the modern apprenticeship system. Pilot schools should reform their talent cultivation models. Schools and enterprises should jointly design talent cultivation plans, formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans. The pilot period for talent cultivation is based on the student's academic term, and the internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. Generally, the top internship is 6 months. In the enterprise practice, an enterprise-based team management mode should be implemented, and each teacher can lead 2 to 5 trainees to form a learning group to ensure that trainees are proficient in the skills required for each rotation job position. From 2016 to August 2019, the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission has determined 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects, with each pilot project having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) have been cultivated. According to the principle of "pilot first and then spread", explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, talent cultivation, and integration of vocational education, in order to effectively improve the skills of students in their job positions and increase the employment rate and quality of employment.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症 南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。 据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。 该组织总监安本·皮莱（Unben Pillay）医生说，他每天都要看几十名病人，但是还没有任何病人需要住院。 皮莱说 ： “ 他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复 。 ” 他说，这包括老年患者和那些有健康问题的患者，这些人群本来更容易因冠状病毒感染而陷入重症。 他说，与之相比，在上一波的德尔塔疫情中，他治疗的新冠患者“呼吸困难，血氧水平低。 许多人几天内就要住院 ” 。 在南部非洲首次报告奥密克戎变异毒株后的两周内，其他医生也分享了类似的经验。 虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。 据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。 非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ” 他还说 ： “ 现在还是早期，我们需要获得后期数据。 通常情况下，住院和死亡发生的时间较晚，而我们进入这一波疫情的时间只有两周 。 ” 与此同时，世界各地的科学家正在观察病例数和住院率，同时测试目前的疫苗和治疗方法的效果。 尽管德尔塔仍然是全世界主要的新冠病毒株，但奥密克戎病例正在数十个国家出现，其中南非为疫情中心。 据卫生官员介绍，豪登省在12月的第一周发现的新病例增加了400 % ， 测试显示，奥密克戎变体的病例占90%以上。

ASSISTANT: South African Doctor: Although the spread of the Omicron variant is strong, it is mostly mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the spread speed is faster. According to a report by the US media, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, the South African Medical Association, consisting of over 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province, reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The organization's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. He said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are usually more prone to severe illness from the coronavirus. He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta outbreak, in which he treated COVID-19 patients with "respiratory distress, low oxygen levels," many of them had to be hospitalized within a few days. In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although more data is needed, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of the previous wave; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in the recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa was 20%. Africa Health Research Institute Director Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said, "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a milder disease." He also said, "We still need to collect more data in the future. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Although the Delta variant remains the dominant strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, the Omicron variant cases are increasing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being at the center of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of cases in KwaZulu-Natal province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and testing showed that the Omicron variant accounted for over 90% of the cases.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。 不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。 它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。 它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。 等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。 建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？ 对新手挺友好，但一过了新手阶段就鸡肋了，但大部分人，特别是女生，过不了新手阶段。

ASSISTANT: Translation:

I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively cheap beginner's racket first. In fact, price is often correlated with friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, a cheap racket may seem more friendly than a more expensive one, but this type of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial garbage. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control. The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, and they know that you may not be able to learn it, so they make a cheap racket that won't break your heart. When you can really tell the difference, it means you've improved, and then you can come back and buy a more expensive racket from me, and I'll make a profit twice. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money and buy a used racket from Prince or Donnay. These brands don't have a strong reputation, so good rackets are also sold at a reasonable price. A new racket around 500-600 yuan is good, and a used one for 200 yuan is also acceptable. Don't you think it's worth it to enjoy the benefits of a 1000 yuan racket for only 200 yuan? It's very friendly to beginners, but once you pass the beginner stage, it's not suitable for everyone, especially women.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。 身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。 裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。 过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。 如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。 其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。 穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。 如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。 越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。 以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。 对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。 微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。 当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。 胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。 短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔! 如果你是上身胖，但腿很瘦的MM，推荐选择华丽感的连衣短裙。 不但能遮住大肚皮，更能展现你的优点。 A字短裙会很显瘦，比较适合胖女孩，上衣要选择紧身一些的，形成层次感会更显瘦。 简简单单白T恤搭配短裙，胖MM也可以尝试。 微胖的女孩也是能够穿出时尚感的。 只要能够掌握好穿衣搭配的法则那么微胖的女孩子们也会是万众瞩目的焦点。 在穿衣搭配方面上有了改变后，在生活中也要多运动，争取早一天脱离微胖女生的标签吧😄

ASSISTANT: Actually, there are many discussions about the dressing for thin girls with a slender body. Thin girls should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the upper leg. If it is too long, it will give a feeling of being short and fat. If you wear a skirt that is divided into three sections, it will give the impression that you have grown taller, with different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks. Many dark-colored outfits are the standard for thin girls, and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black short skirt, can make you look thinner. If your legs are fat, don't draw attention to your socks and shoes. The more casual the outfit, the better. The color should not be too bright, so as not to draw attention to your legs and feet. For thin or slightly overweight girls, it is important to know how to dress. Thin girls should not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the upper body should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have fat legs, you can wear black long socks or mesh socks, choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match a ruffled top, which can well hide the shortcomings of fat girls. Of course, thin girls also need to pay attention to dressing when wearing short skirts. They should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can enhance the effect of making you look thinner. Short skirts matched with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer style! If you are an MM with an upper body that is fat but legs are slender, it is recommended to choose a beautiful and elegant short skirt. It can not only cover your belly, but also showcase your advantages. A-line short skirts can make you look slimmer, and the upper body should be chosen to be a bit tight, which can create a layered effect. A simple white T-shirt can be matched with a short skirt, and even fat MMs can try it. Thin girls can also have a stylish look. As long as you master the rules of dressing, thin girls can also be the focus of attention. After making changes in dressing, you should also pay attention to exercise in daily life and try to leave the label of a fat girl as soon as possible.

Thinness degree: Convenient
Appearance material: Satisfactory
Asus has always had a high cost-performance ratio. The new machine is very good. The performance is stable, and the four outlets for heat dissipation do not have any problems. It is worth recommending. This Asus Strix Scar III gaming laptop is very good. It is made of good materials, and the brand is reliable. The price of the Asus Strix Scar III gaming laptop is not expensive. Personally, I think the Asus Strix Scar III gaming laptop is really good. The gaming effect is smooth, and you can play most games smoothly. The frame rate is stable, and LOL is not laggy at all. CSGO is also easy to win, and most FPS games can be played.

The fan is very powerful, and the work is very quiet. The gaming effect is still good when the fan is fully open.

Appearance material: Cool and eye-catching
The laptop's display effect is clear, and playing games at 1080p is enough. Buying a notebook feels really good. It is mainly used for design work, and the cost-performance ratio is high. It is lighter and more beautiful than imagined, and the color on the buttocks is a very good-looking purple color. It is not too flashy, and the overall is higher than expected. It is a good purchase and suitable for girls.

Two years ago, I started to get acquainted with Asus Strix Shadow, which I have used for two years. The cost-performance ratio is high, and the quality is durable! My friends around me also recommend this product to others. I have already bought three machines of this series! The appearance is beautiful, and the configuration is also good.

号称新山区超跑排气声最大！ 这次我们团队为大家带来的这款车，是许多男人的梦想！ 它就是Lamborghini的旗舰超跑，Murcielago的换代车型 — Aventador LP700-4！ 要价马币近两百万，一年的路税马币十几千，四轮驱动，为什么叫LP700？ 因为拥有700匹的马力，你能想象有多快吗？ 那算了小编也不知道，数据说0-100km/h加速只需要2.9秒，大概就是小编的myvi才要到30km/h的时候人家就到100km/h了，嗯。 低矮的车身、嚣张的剪刀门、遍布车身四周的巨大进气口以及玻璃下一览无余的6.5 v12引擎，完美的诠释了兰博基尼的风格。 对于车款的说明不需要说太多，自己Google一下就好了，小编整理了一些Google不一定给的到的解说！ 太过备受瞩目，去到哪里大家都在看，很不自在！(其实有点爽) 1km油钱在RM1左右 (车主根本不care) 上下车的姿势要练习一下，不然会有点尴尬 (因为会爬不出车舱然后卡住一半) 引擎声太大，下车后会顿时耳聋。(不过还是很爽) 车身太大，停在普通停车位会很窄，很怕被隔壁车开门的时候敲到！ 有点寂寞，因为路上没有对手 (小编自己讲的，跟车主无关，哈哈) 大家不要误会，这视频的超跑并没有要出售，抱歉！ 想要为你的爱车拍摄视频的朋友，欢迎联系我们！ 更多你不知道的汽车资讯，就在 The Car Guide / 人民汽车志 牽扯到价值千万的车祸！ Bugatti Chiron 与 Porsche 911 相信车友们都认识，Chiron 是全球最贵超跑之一，而 Porsche 911 的车价也是百万等级！ 那日前，国外就在短短几分钟内撞掉了百万跑车 911 还有千万超跑 Chiron！ 看结果，贵是有道理的！

ASSISTANT: The Aventador LP700-4 is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini and the successor to the Murcielago. It has a price tag of nearly two hundred million yuan and an annual road tax of tens of thousands of yuan. It is a four-wheel-drive vehicle and is named LP700 because it has 700 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds, which is faster than myvi can reach 30 km/h. The car has a low body, aggressive scissor doors, large air intakes all around the body, and a 6.5-liter V12 engine that is visible through the glass. It perfectly embodies the style of Lamborghini.

There is no need to say too much about the car model, as you can easily find information about it on the internet. This article summarizes some information that may not be available on the internet. The Aventador LP700-4 is so eye-catching that everyone is looking at it wherever it goes, which is a bit embarrassing. The fuel consumption is about RM1 per kilometer (the owner doesn't care), and getting in and out of the car requires some practice to avoid being stuck halfway. The engine noise is too loud, and after getting out of the car, you will suddenly feel deaf. The car body is too big, and if you stop at a regular parking space, it will be very narrow, and you will be afraid of being hit by other cars when they open their doors. It is a bit lonely because there are no other cars on the road (as mentioned by the author, it has nothing to do with the owner).

The video super sports car Aventador LP700-4 is not for sale, so please do not misunderstand. If you want to shoot a video of your car, please contact us. We have more car news that you may not know, including the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911, which are both very expensive cars. Recently, a Bugatti Chiron and a Porsche 911 worth hundreds of millions of yuan were involved in a car accident in just a few seconds. This shows that the expensive cars are worth their price!

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网 新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。 牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。 该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。 许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。 赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。 美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。 赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。 他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。 目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。 亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。 此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

A coalition of Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League schools, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. Over 100 Asian-American groups submitted the complaint on May 23, protesting the discrimination against Asian-American applicants by these three Ivy League schools. The Asian American Education Foundation held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the lawsuit. The president of the coalition, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three Ivy League schools has increased tenfold in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-Americans admitted has remained basically unchanged. Many studies have shown that these schools systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the "holistic consideration" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of Asian-American applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups, and the admission rate was the lowest. The data of the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit the complaint and request the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. They also hope that the schools involved in the lawsuit will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans. The three schools involved in the lawsuit have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination against Asian-Americans, but the U.S. Department of Education did not process the complaint for procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups also participated in the lawsuit.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。 同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。 林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。” 然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。 考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。 好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。 为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。 法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。 一审判决后，原告提起上诉。 近日，二审法院维持原判。 【律师提醒】 在交易过程中要尽到必要的审慎注意义务。 在签订合同时，作为买方要尽到必要的审慎注意义务，比如，核实房屋所有权人信息、房屋是否被人占用等相关信息，并在合同中明确关于交付的具体时间、地点，以防履行合同时双方产生争议。

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yongjia Zhujing Town, Zhejiang, from his real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Ms. Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by wire transfer on the same day. Ms. Lin signed the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the payee, stipulating that if the buyer did not want to purchase the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale and payment methods, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, causing the formal contract to be delayed.

Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, Ms. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu a few days later. Mr. Liu was disappointed and angry that he had almost bought the house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, only to find that the seller did not sell it.

Therefore, Mr. Liu sued Ms. Lin in the Yongjia People's Court. The court held that since the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, it could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty for the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit to the plaintiff.

After the first instance ruling, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.

【Legal Reminder】In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence. When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property has been occupied by others, and stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.

ASSISTANT: Restaurant Review: Jiangchang Restaurant (Wudu Branch)

Environment: Medium-sized and well-structured.

Service: Quick service.

Recommended dishes: "Ancient Method Mala Cake" is a must-try dish. The cake is very fragrant, soft, and delicious. If you like desserts, you must try "Dongjiang Ink Fish and Tofu Porridge". The soup is very flavorful, the tofu is very fresh, and the... The taste of the meat dishes is also very good. The service is enthusiastic.

It's been a long time since I've been to Jiangchang Restaurant. The fruit platter is still as good as I remember. The first time I tried the steamed bun, it had the southern softness and flavor that I love! The porridge is just right in terms of dryness and moisture, and the portion is very generous. The signature Siyi chicken wings are still as good as ever, and the soup is also not bad. The garlic is processed quite well... The taste is very good, and the service is enthusiastic. The meat dishes are also very good.

Jiangchang Restaurant used to be a popular online presence a long time ago, located in Dongdan, with wooden floors. There's always a long wait at the entrance, and the clay pot rice always takes a long time to cook... I haven't been to Jiangchang Restaurant for a few years, and there are now many small shops offering Cantonese cuisine, which has dispersed the customer flow. It's rare to be able to get a seat right away, and the quality of the dishes is still as good as ever.

The taste is very good, and the meat dishes are particularly recommended. Jiangchang Restaurant has been around for a long time and is a well-known establishment. However, with the rise of various small shops offering Cantonese cuisine, the popularity of Jiangchang Restaurant has diminished.

Jiangchang Restaurant offers takeout service.

Food: The dishes this time were a bit disappointing. The three-cup chicken had a bit too much vegetables and not enough chicken meat. The main seasoning was a bit off, with a lack of salty flavor, which made the sweetness more prominent. Everyone can try adding some sweetness and various seasonings to balance the dish.

红牌威士忌喝法是什么？ 每个人的爱好不同，有人喜欢收藏，有人喜欢美食，当然也有人喜欢品酒，红牌威士忌是目前各个国家最畅销的苏格兰威士忌之一，而且红牌威士忌曾获国际洋酒大赛金奖。 每一瓶红牌威士忌都有独特的味道，不过如果不知道如何品味它，岂不是糟蹋了它的醇香。 那么红牌威士忌怎么喝呢？ 小编为大家简单介绍下。 红牌威士忌喝法： 尊尼获加红牌威士忌由约35种苏格兰威士忌调配而成，具有浓郁芳香及传统苏格兰威士忌的特质，浓郁芳香中带有甘甜及烟熏香味。 入口浓醇清新，略带香草及浓烈的烟熏麦芽味道。 该酒可以直接加冰饮用，或者与最喜爱的饮品混合饮用。 红牌威士忌进入国内,为了适应国人的口味,红牌威士忌+可乐或雪碧或新奇士等气泡饮料成为一种经久不衰的时尚。 这些甜味的饮料，除了可以中和酸味,在视觉上能给人带来愉悦，加入饮料,起到冲淡酒味改变口感的效果。 红牌威士忌+切片柠檬+方糖(砂糖亦可),是最正宗、最传统的喝法. 正宗的红方威味道有些酸涩,加入糖可以中和其中的酸味,柠檬则会给酒带来清新的香味,当然,甜酸度可根据个人的口味爱好调配。 以上三种都是红牌威士忌的最好喝法，大家可以作为参考尝试下，希望小编的介绍可以帮助到大家。

金夫人婚纱摄影(南街店) 暂时还没有分店 拍照之前因为我们时间没安排好，更换了两次时间，顾问兰兰很耐心地帮我们安排了时间。 后来选择了一个天气好的周末拍的。 金夫人的工作人员，无论是顾问，化妆师还是摄影师都超赞的。 那是我生平第一次正式地化妆，哇～简直不敢相信，我有一天也会变得那么好看，哈哈。 晓洁和另一个妹子（抱歉我记不得名字了）化妆超级有耐心，化妆也很自然。 外景在江湾城拍的，幸亏那天天气很好，没有觉得很冷，拍照的时候，化妆师时不时地留意我们的衣服，头饰，稍微有一点不好了就马上帮我们整理。 摄影师也非常幽默，拍照一天下来都觉得很开心。 在选照片的时候，因为在网上看到很多案例，不愿意让客人删太多照片，但是我们选照片的时候，真的，一点没有让我们加照片的意思，直接套餐里的24张，一张都没有加（听说和我差不多时间拍婚纱照的表妹，七千多的套餐还加了一万多的照片，当时我就惊呆了，心里也很怕自己会选太多） 今天照片修好了，兰兰发给我，我看了有两张觉得不太好，他们立刻就帮我重新修了。 把妹妹以前拍的照片翻出来对比，我觉得我们的照片我真的太满意了，简约清新，就是我想要的风格。 真心推荐大家去宣汉金夫人拍婚纱照！ 套系价格：3999 元 金夫人感恩有你们真心祝愿你们幸福美满，前程似锦！ 这一套多少钱啊

Golden Madame Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have a branch. Before the photo shoot, we did not have a scheduled time, so we had to change it twice. Our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos. Golden Madame's staff, including the consultant, makeup artist, and photographer, were all praised. It was my first time having a professional makeup done, and I was amazed at how good I looked. Shao Jie and another sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did a great job with the makeup, and it was very natural. The outdoor photos were taken at Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and quickly arranged them if they looked a little messy. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy throughout the day. When we chose the photos, we didn't want to delete too many photos online, but when we chose the photos, we didn't add any extra ones. We just took the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin who took a similar amount of time to take wedding photos with Golden Madame added over 10,000 extra photos, and I was shocked at the time. I was also afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos have been edited, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who had taken photos before, I felt that our photos were much more satisfactory. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Golden Madame to take wedding photos! Package price: 3999 yuan. Golden Madame, thank you for your help, and I wish you all the happiness and prosperity in the world! How much is this package?

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货 （亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。 不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。 他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。 他说，有关问题在2个月前就出现，砂拉越也面对同样的问题。 “其中一个原因是生产特制防伪纸的中国厂家受疫情影响，导致延迟运抵我国 。 ” 他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。 凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。 “该局下周四将派人到吉隆坡取货，回到沙巴立刻进行最后阶段的打印，估计多2个工作日（12月20日）就可以交到申请者手上 。 ” “我们会通知申请者前往各地分局领取报生纸 。 ” 他补充，沙巴今年至今共发出2万4801张报生纸。

ASSISTANT: 3200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the disruption of special anti-forgery paper supply. (Borneo Post, 11th October) The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the stock of special anti-forgery paper ran out, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, with a total of 3,200 affected people so far. However, the department's director, KRU Amins, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and they will be issued as soon as the special anti-forgery paper arrives next week. He explained the issue at a press conference, responding to a media report that the problem with issuing birth certificates in Sabah has been unresolved for 10 months. He said that one of the reasons for the problem was that the Chinese factory producing the special anti-forgery paper was affected by the epidemic and delayed the delivery to Malaysia. He explained that the anti-forgery paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRU Amins revealed that the latest batch of special anti-forgery paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th December and was handed over to the printing company on 8th December for partial printing work. "Our staff will go to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the paper and bring it back to Sabah for the final printing. It is estimated that it will take about two working days (20th December) to distribute to applicants," he said. "We will inform applicants to go to the respective branches to collect their birth certificates." He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网 新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。 根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。 此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。 国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。 实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。 近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。 上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。 通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。 通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。 根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work at land port cities. The notice requires that individuals who have been out of the country for more than 48 hours and are planning to enter land port cities (excluding those with land port cities bordering Hong Kong and Macao) must provide a negative nucleic acid test result within the past 48 hours. After arriving at the land port city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region, or municipality determines the scope of land port cities and announces it to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified land port cities can set up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction.

According to the notice, for some land port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent cross-border traffic between the two sides. Implementing differential management policies can turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.

Recently, China has experienced several local outbreaks of the epidemic, all of which were imported from overseas through land port cities. The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate management of high-risk personnel, insufficient implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, poor management of cold chain logistics, irregular management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies.

The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism at land port cities, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in land port city epidemic prevention and control, and do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work, tightening the defense line against the import of the epidemic.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网 逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。 现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。 等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。 正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。 这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。 因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。 对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。 绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。 马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。 “最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。 或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。 “次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。 总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。 由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。 只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。 总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: Don't scare people into taking action at the starting line - Xinhua Net. When browsing books at a book fair, you can often feel the heat of successful self-help books. Today's successful self-help books often tout the "best principle" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental stage of "how to do it." As a result, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are all-out efforts or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100 or they are 0; either you climb the Great Wall or you wait at the original place. This "best principle" is widely recognized as "absolutely correct," but it scares 99% of people into submission at the starting line. This is because this theory advocates a path of "suffering and making a 180-degree transformation," which is the fatal weakness of many people. For those who are rigid in following rules, stubborn in adhering to old ways, and resistant to change, it is self-deception to shout at them to "transform." In most cases, people are paralyzed in front of the word "transformation," unable to take the first step, or they make a rash decision and take the first step, but they often fail after a short while and give up. Master Ma's famous "From Tomorrow" routine in his comedy routine best exemplifies this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's ability, making them "sigh and admire" from afar. Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way to help more ordinary people achieve relative success. The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "achieving great victories through small victories," that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb the Great Wall, climbing the small sand hill in front of your house is okay, because that is also stronger than standing still. In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing. Since the threshold has been lowered significantly, this has increased the possibility of ordinary people persisting and increasing their chances of success. However, the success path of the "second-best principle" is slightly longer than that of the "best principle." In summary, although the "best principle" appears to be a flag for everyone to succeed, it ultimately only motivates a small number of people; while the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网 新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。 青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。 20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。 2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。 从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。 与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。 青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。 青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。 为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。

ASSISTANT: According to a report from the reporter Li Xiaofeng and Zhang Hongxiao of Xinhua News Agency, the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the protection period in 2002, the cumulative increase is more than 40 times. Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Qinghai fish", is a rare and precious fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake catchment area.

In the 20th century, the Qinghai Lake carp was severely depleted due to factors such as excessive fishing and deteriorating breeding habitat. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2,592 tons. In 2004, it was listed as an endangered species in the "Red Data Book of Chinese Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries, prohibiting any units, collectives, or individuals from fishing, selling, or processing Qinghai Lake carp and its products.

At the same time, various measures such as artificial breeding and releasing, river channel cleaning, and designing scientific and reasonable "passageways" for fish have been continuously strengthened to protect the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp. As of now, the total number of artificially bred and released Qinghai Lake carp has reached nearly 1.8 million, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources.

Qinghai Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the water bodies of Qinghai Lake, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, various measures have been taken this year to ban fishing in the key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Huang River, and Qinghai Lake, and to establish a comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？ 选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。 随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。 在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。 “在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!” 李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。 李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。 李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。 后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。 因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。 但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。 因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。 水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。 同时你可以随便拿电笔测。

ASSISTANT: Is a foot bath with bubbles and tingling feet a sign of leakage? Choosing an appropriate foot bath can bring good therapeutic effects, and today's US small editors will answer this question for you. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, foot baths and traditional household electrical appliances sell well, but foot baths do not have their own industry standards, so there are certain safety risks. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as whether it can be used at the highest temperature, which groups of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, and so on. However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may have been produced without strict quality control during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. You can also test with a pen at will.

ASSISTANT: The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline News - Hunan Daily Network - China Sound Online - Hunan Daily December 10, 2022 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Shanwu, Hu Minmin, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photography: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Hope Red Tea Promotion Conference was held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-yuan tea industry. The Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, He Xunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony. Academician Lou Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the red tea source in New Hope and the rise of red tea as the new impetus for "Five Colors of Xiang Tea" during the opening ceremony. In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan tea industry in Hunan, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five Colors of Tea". Tea industries in the province have increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main force, promoting the integration of tea tourism in the main tea-producing areas, driving tea farmers to increase income. The wind turns, and red tea is on the rise again. Tea industry experts in the province said that after completing green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens continues to rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and New Hope welcomed the "source of Hunan Red Tea". In the New Hope Red Tea Exhibition Hall, tea merchants from Fujian were impressed by a high-mountain tea named "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order. The Secretary-General of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhen, said happily that the epidemic and other factors may have affected the tea leaf market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, the highlights were abundant. The red tea of New Hope injected the cultural connotation of tea, and the popularity and trading were hot, welcoming a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.

ASSISTANT: Time Travel Photography [Effect] Picture Effect: I took two outfits and overall it's not bad. I really like this set of pictures. [Service] Service Details: Because I was pregnant, I was a bit uncomfortable during the makeup process. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest while they continued to take care of me. They also kept giving me hot water to drink. The package price is 1000 yuan. Thank you for your review, Cute Rabbit. Originally, I was going to refuse to shoot in a traditional style, but the final product was simply too beautiful. Thank you for your recognition, and your satisfaction means a lot to us. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really amazing. I strongly recommend all friends to come! From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-processing, there is nothing to complain about. The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and she will match a makeup style that suits you based on your style. The makeup products used are all first-line brands. Teacher Tian is also very professional in photography. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little cats playing around. We are working in Beijing, and many good photo studios need to be queued up for half a year in Beijing. Our colleagues who have been to Beijing have said that the final product is just so-so. We specially searched for this studio, which is a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is a common problem for most people. The photographer, Xiaohong, will take pictures of our natural and exciting moments. The makeup artist, the photographer, and the post-processing team are all excellent. The final product and the people around us all praised it. We have already recommended our friends to come, and our friends who have just watched the film are also very satisfied. We hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover it and shoot according to their own style, rather than following the same formula. Thank you very much for your five-star review, Caiqing and Jingling. You are both very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the work to the satisfaction of our customers. Thank you for your support and recognition. The assistant is sweet and friendly, and the photographer teacher is lively and energetic. Each member of the team is very nice. It was a beautiful and unforgettable shooting experience, and the effect of the shooting was better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘 Thank you for your review, Xiaoyu. It's great to meet you all. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is like a journey of several thousand kilometers. I'm very happy to meet you all. If we have the opportunity, we'll come to Qinhuangdao to play again next time.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。 如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。 但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。 要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。 当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。 首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。 其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。 你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。 比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。 如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。 但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。 另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。 如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。 而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。 以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

ASSISTANT: A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training institution, but if you don't have this idea, self-study is still a good choice. After all, training costs a lot of money and takes 6 months to learn. However, if you plan to dive into this industry, training is a good choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, look at the strength of the instructors in this institution. If the instructors are not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong instructors. Second, investigate the training institution before choosing it. It is best to investigate the students of the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know whether the institution is good or not, and whether the courses are good or not.

Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have any information about your situation. Learning this stuff depends on your personal situation, such as your major, age, and the language you want to learn, as well as where you are located. If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the learning cost is high, and the investment of time is also relatively large, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. But if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can find them on B station, or you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.

If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teachers' explanations are also very detailed. There are people who can answer your questions, and there is also help with learning planning and supervision. In addition, many training institutions have signed employment agreements, with internal recommendation positions, and after studying, they can be recommended to companies. This can save you a lot of trouble when interviewing for a job.

That's my opinion. I didn't explain it in detail before because I didn't know your situation. If you have other questions to consult, you can communicate with me at any time.

Thank you to everyone who has silently given me a thumbs up. With hard work and perseverance, life can be tiring but it's important to keep going. Life won't disappoint those who put in effort. If you like my work, please follow me. Thank you to everyone who has silently given me a thumbs up. Life is like this, others only see the results, but we face it with perseverance. We have no choice but to move forward, we can't go back the way we came... Cleaning is a job and a responsibility, but it's also an art. We may do the dirtiest work, but we approach every corner of the customer's home with the most sincere attitude, and when we see the customer's satisfaction and raised thumbs, it's all worth it. Our efforts will be rewarded!

My daily work - your requirements, my service. With heart and sincerity, we clean and keep things clean, leaving only beauty. You care about the details, and we make your home "clean" to the best of our ability, serving our love for the home.

Clean and tidy for every family, a monument for our cleaning services, service at the right place, cleanliness in every home.

Indoor and outdoor cleaning. Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it will lose its luster if not cleaned regularly. Only after cleaning can it shine with its full color. Life is the same, doing things with sincerity is the key to success. Paying attention to details and crafting with precision is what we do.

Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is what motivates me the most!

Currently, all industries are tough, but I believe that as long as we have a sincere attitude, perseverance, and effort, we will be better than others. At least we won't be sitting and complaining, right?

One day's plan begins with the morning. All the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything you desire. Maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning!

When we were young, happiness was something we possessed, and having it made us happy. As we grew up, happiness became a goal we sought, and achieving it made us happy. As we matured, we realized that happiness is a state of mind, and understanding it makes us happy.

Be the best version of yourself, act according to your heart, and there will be no regrets in life. Life is one journey, and we should walk our own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a happy heart, live a beautiful life until old age!

At every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges. Often, what limits us is not our ability, but our courage to face it. If we can't avoid it, let's face it bravely. The more afraid we are, the more we will be defeated by difficulties; if we face them head-on, problems will eventually be solved.

ASSISTANT: Saudi Arabia's First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition Held in Riyadh - Xinhua Net

RIYADH, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the art district of JAX in the northwest of the capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.

The biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. UCCA Center for Contemporary Art Director Tian Weidong served as the art director of the exhibition.

According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of cultural development in Saudi society.

The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is divided into six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among others. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also highly anticipated, some of whom use innovative ways to create art using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Mountains of the River" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.

The CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, Bakkili, said that he hoped that this biennial exhibition could establish an international dialogue and allow audiences around the world to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative communities in Saudi Arabia. Tian Weidong said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, enabling Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."

During the opening week of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and experts, curators, and opinion leaders in the art and creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网 新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。 云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。 此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。 在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。 招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。 此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Comprehensive and Standardized Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua Net, December 12, 2022 (reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continue to do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, and to consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security recently issued policies to promote the standardized management of rural public welfare posts, which will help promote the comprehensive development of rural areas.

At present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million rural public welfare posts, which are used to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken populations. These posts have played an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment income growth, consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.

This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the Rural Revitalization, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of objects for recruiting rural public welfare post personnel, financial management, post development, and post management, etc.

In terms of post development, the new regulation clarifies that posts should be set up according to "demand-oriented, post-based, dynamic management, and quantitative control" principles, and the principles of "who develops, who uses, who is responsible, and one person per post, voluntary public disclosure, and unified management" should be followed. The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training, and on-the-job training.

In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare posts, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare posts, and requires that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare posts purchase commercial accident insurance for the rural public welfare post placement personnel. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation of rural public welfare posts.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。 但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。 从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。 三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。 但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。 四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。 再聊聊左。 左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。 如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！ 五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。 跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。 也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？ 我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！ 许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。 和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。 左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。 而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。 现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。 虽然看不懂，点赞就完事儿啦 啥也不说了，花花就是这么仗义

ASSISTANT: 二、Although right-wing forces have had their moments in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight and break out in a sweat when they get a little bit of water. As soon as they show some determination, they are immediately attacked and defeated. However, in the process of social progress, the right-wing has played a positive role. From ending the definition of truth during the Cultural Revolution to promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.

三、Although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he says and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere about China's social problems. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary and that revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties.

四、Changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunism and seeking personal gain will only lead to confusion and chaos. Let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of discarded products of history and politics. If the right has some positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost its way because it only wants what the Communist Party has discarded!

五、Recently, I saw some friends panicking and arguing with each other about the right and the left. They were very passionate, but I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with the Han collaborators and the leftists. It's all nonsense. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the right-wingers and leftists admit that we are right. Why bother? I tell my friends that when the right-wingers curse us as "five blacks" and the leftists curse us as "right dogs," it proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but as they grew older, they forgot about them or pursued them, but ended up becoming dogmatic.

Left and right, in general, refer to constraints and freedom. China's overall tendency towards leftism is due to its innate genetic predisposition from its historical and cultural background. The right-wing in China emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes supervision and safety. Nowadays, society as a whole is more concerned about fairness, and with the competition between China and the United States, leftism is confirmed, and it is likely to continue for many years to come. Although I don't understand it, I'll just say that it's all very biased.

今天来看一些【奇怪的热搜】。 什么是正常的舆情？ 随机挑选三个热搜：二月二龙抬头、好丽友涨价、货拉拉事件，舆情扩散形成波峰，然后【指数下降】（平滑曲线）最终消散，如果产生次生舆情会有小驼峰再次出现。 它们看起来和网信办官网曾展示的【网络舆情演化模型】相差无二。 什么是异常的舆情？ 随机挑选同一事件中的六个热搜，呈现出【孤峰状】、【锯齿状】、【断崖状】。 【孤峰状】即人为加热，迅速冲榜热搜，引起大众关注；【锯齿状】即周期性加热，确保话题盘踞热搜榜单；【断崖状】即集体撤离，该热搜发挥完“功能”，接到新任务、冲向新战场。 图9中，一个事件的热度波峰恰好是另一事件的波谷，时间分秒不差，必定是统一批水军接到任务，开启新一轮攻势。 黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。 传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。 凡走过必留下痕迹，这样的痕迹，我们一起挖出来。 数据来源：热搜时光机。

ASSISTANT: Today, let's take a look at some [strange searches]. What is normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lunar New Year, the rise of good friends, and the commodity price event. Public opinion spreads and forms a wave, then [decreases exponentially] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there may be a small peak reappear. They look exactly the same as the [network public opinion evolution model] displayed on the official website of the network administration bureau.

What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present [isolated peaks], [jagged peaks], and [cliff-like peaks]. [Isolated peaks] refer to human-induced heating, quickly rising to the top of the hot search list and attracting public attention; [jagged peaks] refer to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; [cliff-like peaks] refer to collective withdrawal, the hot search having fulfilled its "function", being assigned to a new task, and moving to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's hotness is exactly the trough of another event's hotness, and the time difference is only a few seconds, which must be due to a coordinated attack by the water army, launching a new round of offensives.

The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: several hot searches are simultaneously on the podium, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for publicity, which ones create warfare, which ones divert the line of sight, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, which ones are bundled with judgments, and which ones are refined in terms of nodes and batches. Almost all factors of public opinion dissemination are considered.

Dissemination is a science, discarding subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions, and only from objective data, black public relations also has no place to hide. Every step leaves a trace, and these traces, we dig them out together.

毛里求斯等国首次发现奥密克戎毒株感染病例-新华网 新华社北京12月12日电 综合新华社驻外记者报道：毛里求斯、塞浦路斯和马拉维近日首次报告发现新冠变异病毒奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 毛里求斯10日首次报告该国两例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 据毛卫生部长凯莱什·贾古特帕尔介绍，一名感染者为自南非出发于11月27日抵达毛里求斯的游客；另一名感染者为毛里求斯本地居民，他与一名近期曾前往南非后返回的人员接触后，于11月30日核酸检测呈阳性。 经医院隔离治疗后，这两名感染者核酸检测结果均转为阴性，目前已返回各自的居住地。 塞浦路斯卫生部10日宣布该国首次确诊3例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 这3人都是学生，本月初从国外旅行回来，由于均为轻症，并未入院治疗。 为防范奥密克戎毒株蔓延，塞政府不断加大防控力度。 从12月6日到明年1月10日，乘飞机入境的12岁以上旅客抵塞后都需自费在机场接受核酸检测。 塞卫生部10日还宣布，将开始为该国5岁至11岁的儿童接种辉瑞新冠疫苗。 马拉维卫生部长昆比泽·奇蓬达9日说，该国首次发现3例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 该国卫生部门对从11月9日至12月2日采集的12个新冠阳性样本开展基因组测序，发现了这3例感染病例。

ASSISTANT: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency on December 12. Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on December 10, with one case involving a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27, and the other involving a local resident who had contact with a person who had recently traveled from South Africa and tested positive for the virus on November 30. Both patients were isolated and treated at the hospital, and their nucleic acid test results turned negative after treatment. Cyprus reported its first three cases of the Omicron variant on December 10, all of whom were students who returned to Cyprus from abroad earlier this month. They are all mild cases and have not been hospitalized. The government of Cyprus is increasing its efforts to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. Starting from December 6, all passengers over the age of 12 who enter Cyprus by plane will be required to take a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense. Cyprus's health department also announced on December 10 that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. Malawi's health minister, Khumbize Chiponda, said on December 9 that the country had discovered its first three cases of the Omicron variant. The country's health department sequenced the genes of 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three cases.

大美360集成家装 地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼 一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。 来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。 我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。 他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。 我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。 这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。 他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。 除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。 我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。 当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。 无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。 各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。 坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。 所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。 以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。 想要向商家提问，请先登录或注册 严禁发布各种形式的商家点评，详细请见商户收录声明 大众点评昆明装修设计频道为您提供大美360集成家装地址，电话，营业时间等最新商户信息，找装修公司装修公司，就上大众点评

从以前到现在，我都反对任何形式的污蔑和谩骂，更不能接受这类人身攻击的行为。 在文明社会，我们可以包容一切，但就是要杜绝这种恶棍。 如果不看政党和派系，要先抵制的，就是这种不文明的作风。 从你开始发来脸书加好友请求开始，进而发表具调侃性的帖子，再到你试图把所谓我的家地点和父亲名字发布在社交媒体上，我都已经采取不回应的态度。 你过后变本加厉地不只按一日六餐的频率持续tag我，更在脸书跟你的所谓朋友们继续肆无忌惮地讨论着关于我一些隐晦、羞辱的言论，样貌、身材、好生养、又什么床上种草莓、要不要插之类的留言，我...也算了。 怎知后来我更收到多位朋友发来有关你的脸书朋友户口上载一张你的照片和具性骚扰成分的言论。 抱歉，作为一位女生，我再也无法继续沉默了。 我报警的新闻上载后，你完全没有收敛，反而更越发嚣张。 我不理你是什么政治背景，也不管你是什么身份地位，在我们的社会，是需要两性尊重的。 是的，你们可以继续这种具调侃性、隐晦、羞辱、辱骂的言论，你也可以继续说你只是关爱和关注我，你可以继续认为这并不是骚扰、你甚至可以继续否认那不是你制的图或者继续发表一切攻击性言论。 没错，我不能，也没有能力阻止你们。 我既不认识你，也不想认识你，我的样貌和身材更不需要你评头论足。 我甚至不认为会有哪一位女生愿意让别人如此地羞辱自己来换来出名。 朋友问我，还好吗？ 我说好，你也不会信。 我觉得不会有任何一位女生被如此霸凌后还可以说自己还好。 无论在工作、社会、政坛或商界，只有那些连基本品德都没有的人，才会选择用这种方式来伤害任何一位女性。 我相信，公道自在人心。 我截了部分留言给大家评理 你自己发的贴应该没有人可以冒充你了吧 我只能说你是文明的公敌 会心一笑

ASSISTANT: From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks. In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but such behavior must be eliminated. If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized behavior. From the moment you send me a friend request on Facebook and start posting provocative posts, to your attempt to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude. Later, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of one post per day, but also continued to discuss about me with your so-called friends on Facebook in a disrespectful and humiliating manner, commenting on my appearance, figure, diet, and even what kind of fruit I plant in my bed, whether I should or should not insert it, and so on. I... I've had enough.

After I reported the news, you completely ignored it and became even more arrogant. I don't care what your political background is or what your identity is, in our society, it is necessary to respect both genders. Yes, you can continue with such provocative, obscene, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, you can continue to believe that this is not your post or continue to publish all kinds of attacking language. But I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't even want to recognize you, and I don't think any woman would want to be humiliated like this in exchange for fame.

When my friends asked me if I was okay, I said I was, but I don't think you would believe it. I don't think any woman could be so humiliated and still say she's okay. Whether in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who lack basic ethics would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice will be served. I have taken note of some of the comments and will share them with everyone. You yourself cannot impersonate me, can you? I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.

ASSISTANT: The following document is a review of a home appliance store located at No. 55, High-speed Railway North Road, Shayibake District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China. The reviewer describes the store as having a complete selection of home appliances from various well-known brands, and offers a discount on water purifiers during the Double 12 event. The store has 11 floors, with the second and third floors being parking areas, and parking is free during the day. The surroundings of the store are not very impressive, with few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the food in the restaurants is average. The elevator in the store is also unresponsive, and it takes a long time to go up and down between floors. The reviewer suggests that the store needs to improve and develop more areas. The address of the store is No. 555, High-speed Railway North Road, Shayibake District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, and it is conveniently located with a large parking lot and free parking during the day. The environment of the store is spacious, with 8-9 floors, offering a wide selection of home furnishings, household appliances, and various small items from many well-known brands such as Midea, Haier, Suning, Lao Boss, Yuedian, Foshan, Yadan, and more. The reviewer recommends the store as a good place to shop for home appliances and suggests that visitors can take a break and sit on the sofa after they are done shopping. The reviewer is currently undecided on whether to buy a comfortable sofa, as they have seen many options at the store, including those from Midea and Meike Home, but they are hesitant due to the slightly higher prices.

ASSISTANT: The Yangtze River's upstream green integrated service area has been fully covered - Xinhua Net, December 11, 2021 (reporter Wang Xian) The Changjiang River upstream green integrated service area in Chongqing was officially put into operation on December 10, following the opening of the downstream water-based green integrated service area in Yibin, Sichuan Province. This is the second water-based green integrated service area on the Yangtze River upstream after the Yibin area was officially put into operation. With this, the water-based green integrated service area has covered the entire upstream, middle, and downstream of the Yangtze River.

The Transportation Department's Changjiang River Navigation Management Bureau's deputy director, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that before, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 water-based green integrated service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were well received by the majority of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.

The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone event in the construction of green Yangtze River shipping, and the reception and handling of ship pollutants and the service capacity of shipping have been significantly improved. It is introduced that the water-based green integrated service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for the majority of ships and ship crews, helping them solve the "urgent, difficult, and worried" problems.

This time, the two water-based green integrated service areas on the upstream Yangtze River were officially put into operation, integrating living services, production services, and public services, with environmental protection as the main theme and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as the highlight. They can provide "one-stop berthing and multiple services" for inland ships, making the work of ship crews more efficient and their lives more convenient.

ASSISTANT: The joint exercise "Peaceful Relief-2021" between the armed forces of China and Vietnam has been successfully concluded. All participating Chinese teams have safely returned to China's Guangxi territory, marking the completion of a seven-day training mission.

During this joint exercise, the armed forces of China and Vietnam focused on the topic of humanitarian medical relief and tightly adhered to the mission of emergency aid and disaster relief. They completed joint emergency command, joint on-site rescue, and mass treatment of casualties, among other topics, in accordance with practical standards, effectively enhancing the ability of both sides to provide emergency aid.

The results of the exercise have been recognized by both sides. The chairman of the exercise directing committee of the Vietnamese side, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, said at the closing ceremony that Vietnamese military doctors have learned about the organization and professional activities of the exercise from Chinese military doctors, as well as about China's medical and support equipment. The results of the exercise prove the professional capabilities of the military medical forces of both countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention.

The chairman of the Chinese guidance and coordination group, Chen Chunming, deputy director of the Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, said that this exercise is another innovative practice based on the successful joint medical examination in 2018, with very important milestone significance.

During the exercise, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid testing instruments to the Vietnamese People's Army.
