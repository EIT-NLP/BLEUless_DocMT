This is a certificate that I think is very meaningful - a first aid certificate. It is one of the skill certificates that I think are important besides my driver's license! Let's popularize it: Emergency first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be performed before the ambulance arrives in the event of an emergency. As everyone knows, there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the process of coming to the scene of an accident. It is precisely this period of time that is the most critical. This is the time when emergency first aid is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or cardiac arrest, then the window for saving my life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes! Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know emergency first aid! When someone collapses nearby, we can perform emergency first aid using professional knowledge instead of standing there helplessly doing nothing, which is too terrifying.  According to the founder of the first responders, in China, we have official data of 3 million people dying from accidents every year, the most dangerous of which is sudden cardiac arrest. In the United States, only 15% can be saved on average. In Las Vegas casinos, 78% can be saved, and in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%.  The founder of the first responders said that if someone has sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, artificial respiration and chest compressions are necessary to save them. I found that we still have few people who have the awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late, so I still call on everyone to learn this skill. Maybe we can save a life! The first aid certificate can be registered at the local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There are also discounts for students.  PS: The last photo is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turned 25, and adding the first aid certificate to the list of goals is something I did a few months ago, but I have completed it! Next, I plan to take other exams I want to take, such as a diving certificate. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving and first aid certificate, and it seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take the diving certificate. Therefore, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

The Chongqing Municipal Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system. Starting from this year, 60 vocational schools in the city will adopt the modern apprenticeship model for talent cultivation, and students who are admitted will be pre-recruited as employees by the pilot enterprises. The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and pilot enterprise trainees should be clarified. Apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who are over 16 years old but under 18 years old, the agreement must be signed by the apprentices, their legal guardians, the schools, and the enterprises to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits for on-the-job training. The commission encourages pilot schools to conduct pre-employment training and on-the-job training in cooperation with partner enterprises using the modern apprenticeship system. Pilot schools should reform their talent cultivation models. Schools and enterprises should jointly design talent cultivation plans, formulate professional teaching standards, curriculum standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans. The pilot period for talent cultivation is based on the student's academic term, and the internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. Generally, the top internship is 6 months. In the enterprise practice, an enterprise-based team management mode should be implemented, and each teacher can lead 2 to 5 trainees to form a learning group to ensure that trainees are proficient in the skills required for each rotation job position. From 2016 to August 2019, the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission has determined 60 city-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects, with each pilot project having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) have been cultivated. According to the principle of "pilot first and then spread", explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, talent cultivation, and integration of vocational education, in order to effectively improve the skills of students in their job positions and increase the employment rate and quality of employment.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and in the end, it was ruthlessly scrapped. The dust suction effect is not bad, and the amount of dust in the house has decreased significantly. However, it feels a bit heavy when holding it with one hand. The moist wipe needs to be improved, and there will be dust marks when wiping back and forth. Overall, I am still satisfied. The rice cooker is quite heavy, looking tall and imposing, and is suitable for my small kitchen. The children said that it tastes better than the food I cook myself. I have made two-flavor rice and braised pork ribs, which are particularly delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but other cooking times are very short. The noise is small, and there is no need to worry about overcooking or not knowing how to cook. After receiving the goods, I immediately cooked three dishes for lunch during the middle of the day. It is really amazing how technology changes life. The temperature and seasoning control are precise, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the level of a professional chef. It is definitely a godsend for those who are not good at cooking. I highly recommend purchasing it! I have added a new member to my kitchen. The smart rice cooker that automatically controls the temperature and flips the food. No longer afraid of being burned by hot oil, no longer afraid of not controlling the fire properly and overcooking or undercooking the food. The dishes that come out are much better than what I can cook, and the tomato fried eggs are particularly delicious. The chicken eggs have a very good taste. This pot is worth the money. The overall is good, very clear, and consistent with the description. It is worth having. The customer service is also very good. The screen is large, clear, and does not tire the eyes. So far, I have not found any other abnormalities. Compared to the current mainstream displays, it is thicker, and the border is wider, but the screen display effect is not bad, and the accessories are complete. The logistics speed is fast! The seller's service attitude is good! The quality is good, and the screen resolution is also clear. The fried rice is very good, and it is perfect. The logistics is fast, the goods are good, and I bought the second one. It is definitely a good thing, with a high-quality display, no distortion due to the large screen, and a complete interface. It is visually impressive, and the color reproduction is good.

South African Doctor: Although the spread of the Omicron variant is strong, it is mostly mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although the spread speed is faster. According to a report by the US media, with the spread of the Omicron variant in South Africa, the South African Medical Association, consisting of over 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province, reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The organization's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. He said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are usually more prone to severe illness from the coronavirus. He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta outbreak, in which he treated COVID-19 patients with "respiratory distress, low oxygen levels," many of them had to be hospitalized within a few days. In the two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although more data is needed, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of the previous wave; the average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in the recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of COVID-19 in South Africa was 20%. Africa Health Research Institute Director Willem Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said, "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a milder disease." He also said, "We still need to collect more data in the future. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Although the Delta variant remains the dominant strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, the Omicron variant cases are increasing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being at the center of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of cases in KwaZulu-Natal province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and testing showed that the Omicron variant accounted for over 90% of the cases.

Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, delivered a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 6th Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Video Creation Park in Mashan on December 10, 2021, according to a report by the Hunan Daily on December 10, 2021 (reporter Guan Bowei). According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and the Minister of the Propaganda Department, delivered a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the 6th Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China at the Video Creation Park in Mashan on December 10, 2021, and deeply studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the situation in Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China.  Yang Haodong expounded on the core meaning and practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China from the three aspects of ideal beliefs and initial aspirations, self-revolution and youth of the Communist Party, and the leadership of the Communist Party and its theory, combined with his personal feelings and experiences. He emphasized that it is necessary to integrate the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the situation in Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China, and study and implement them in a unified way, so as to enhance the self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two safeguards" in thought, politics, and action, and unswervingly follow the direction indicated by General Secretary Xi Jinping.  During the interactive exchange section, representatives of grassroots party members, representatives of enterprises, and representatives of young people asked questions about the relationship between the three historical decisions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishments", how cultural enterprises should seize the direction, and how new generations can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Communist Party. Yang Haodong answered them one by one with simple language and vivid examples, urging young party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Communist Party and tighten their bonds with the central leadership of the Party, unswervingly follow the Party, and use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and bear the burden.
According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on December 11, 2022, the number of graduates from universities in Beijing is expected to reach 268,000 in 2022, an increase of 16,000 compared to the previous year. At the 2022 Beijing Graduate Employment and Entrepreneurship Work Video Conference held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of Education and the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, relevant personnel from the two departments announced the deployment of employment work for Beijing university graduates.  The personnel from the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that they would strengthen the matching of supply and demand, enhance policy support, broaden employment channels, ensure assistance for difficult cases, support innovation and entrepreneurship, and improve service efficiency in various aspects to deploy the employment work for Beijing university graduates.  The reporter learned that the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau would establish a practical platform, increase the number of job positions, actively contact 40 university graduate career experience bases, visit user units, and integrate demand and position information. They would focus on expanding the recruitment of the "six groups", including expanding the recruitment of civil service units, expanding the recruitment of state-owned enterprises, expanding the recruitment of grassroots projects, expanding the recruitment of military service, expanding the recruitment of internships and part-time jobs, and expanding the recruitment of innovation and entrepreneurship. They would implement dynamic management with "one policy for a lifetime" and recommend at least 5 job position information for each graduate, ensuring that all graduates with employment intentions receive assistance.
Actually, I's not sure if it's the store's mistake or the courier's mistake. The bag doesn't have an invoice. I can't investigate further. I hope you guys understand.
Because the estimated delivery time has been shortened by 30 minutes and is no longer displayed, thank you.
Yes, I have changed the rider. He has been waiting for a long time. The restaurant has been saying that they are processing it for several hours.
I have taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
It turns out that #NUMBER# was the one who didn't call me back.  (Note: #NUMBER# is a placeholder for a specific number or person's name, which needs to be replaced with the actual number or name in order to make sense in the context of the document.)
I can't eat anymore. I'm definitely going to sue you. Why didn't you tell me earlier? It took you so long.
No, I haven't received the call. Please notify them and have them send it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
A meal has been waiting for half an hour. #PRS\_ORG# has not been delivered yet. I want to cancel the order. Why won't you let me cancel?
Hello, the chicken you ordered from the restaurant is fresh.
Translation:  I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively cheap beginner's racket first. In fact, price is often correlated with friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, a cheap racket may seem more friendly than a more expensive one, but this type of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial garbage. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control. The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, and they know that you may not be able to learn it, so they make a cheap racket that won't break your heart. When you can really tell the difference, it means you've improved, and then you can come back and buy a more expensive racket from me, and I'll make a profit twice. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money and buy a used racket from Prince or Donnay. These brands don't have a strong reputation, so good rackets are also sold at a reasonable price. A new racket around 500-600 yuan is good, and a used one for 200 yuan is also acceptable. Don't you think it's worth it to enjoy the benefits of a 1000 yuan racket for only 200 yuan? It's very friendly to beginners, but once you pass the beginner stage, it's not suitable for everyone, especially women.
Order has been delayed multiple times for delivery. Can you please help follow up on this? Delay, thank you.
That's to say, in fact, I already have credit?
May I know if I need to place a new order or should I just ignore the previous one?

Actually, there are many discussions about the dressing for thin girls with a slender body. Thin girls should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the upper leg. If it is too long, it will give a feeling of being short and fat. If you wear a skirt that is divided into three sections, it will give the impression that you have grown taller, with different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks. Many dark-colored outfits are the standard for thin girls, and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially a black short skirt, can make you look thinner. If your legs are fat, don't draw attention to your socks and shoes. The more casual the outfit, the better. The color should not be too bright, so as not to draw attention to your legs and feet. For thin or slightly overweight girls, it is important to know how to dress. Thin girls should not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the upper body should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have fat legs, you can wear black long socks or mesh socks, choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match a ruffled top, which can well hide the shortcomings of fat girls. Of course, thin girls also need to pay attention to dressing when wearing short skirts. They should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can enhance the effect of making you look thinner. Short skirts matched with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer style! If you are an MM with an upper body that is fat but legs are slender, it is recommended to choose a beautiful and elegant short skirt. It can not only cover your belly, but also showcase your advantages. A-line short skirts can make you look slimmer, and the upper body should be chosen to be a bit tight, which can create a layered effect. A simple white T-shirt can be matched with a short skirt, and even fat MMs can try it. Thin girls can also have a stylish look. As long as you master the rules of dressing, thin girls can also be the focus of attention. After making changes in dressing, you should also pay attention to exercise in daily life and try to leave the label of a fat girl as soon as possible.

Is there only one order for shrimp dumplings? Why do you have six copies?
I won't go. I'm just following the order. I haven't been contacted for over an hour. This is definitely an online scam. You think I'm a first-time food delivery person? After finishing the investigation, you're the one who said that! Before placing the order, I checked the address several times. I only placed the order after confirming it was correct. Thank you! How many days is it?
From 7:00 am to now 9:30 am, none of them have been sent, you must return the deposit and cancel the order. Okay.
The Aventador LP700-4 is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini and the successor to the Murcielago. It has a price tag of nearly two hundred million yuan and an annual road tax of tens of thousands of yuan. It is a four-wheel-drive vehicle and is named LP700 because it has 700 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.9 seconds, which is faster than myvi can reach 30 km/h. The car has a low body, aggressive scissor doors, large air intakes all around the body, and a 6.5-liter V12 engine that is visible through the glass. It perfectly embodies the style of Lamborghini.  There is no need to say too much about the car model, as you can easily find information about it on the internet. This article summarizes some information that may not be available on the internet. The Aventador LP700-4 is so eye-catching that everyone is looking at it wherever it goes, which is a bit embarrassing. The fuel consumption is about RM1 per kilometer (the owner doesn't care), and getting in and out of the car requires some practice to avoid being stuck halfway. The engine noise is too loud, and after getting out of the car, you will suddenly feel deaf. The car body is too big, and if you stop at a regular parking space, it will be very narrow, and you will be afraid of being hit by other cars when they open their doors. It is a bit lonely because there are no other cars on the road (as mentioned by the author, it has nothing to do with the owner).  The video super sports car Aventador LP700-4 is not for sale, so please do not misunderstand. If you want to shoot a video of your car, please contact us. We have more car news that you may not know, including the Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911, which are both very expensive cars. Recently, a Bugatti Chiron and a Porsche 911 worth hundreds of millions of yuan were involved in a car accident in just a few seconds. This shows that the expensive cars are worth their price!

Chinese to English Translation:  A coalition of Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League schools, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. Over 100 Asian-American groups submitted the complaint on May 23, protesting the discrimination against Asian-American applicants by these three Ivy League schools. The Asian American Education Foundation held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the lawsuit. The president of the coalition, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three Ivy League schools has increased tenfold in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-Americans admitted has remained basically unchanged. Many studies have shown that these schools systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the "holistic consideration" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of Asian-American applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups, and the admission rate was the lowest. The data of the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit the complaint and request the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. They also hope that the schools involved in the lawsuit will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans. The three schools involved in the lawsuit have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination against Asian-Americans, but the U.S. Department of Education did not process the complaint for procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups also participated in the lawsuit.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yongjia Zhujing Town, Zhejiang, from his real estate agent. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Liu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Ms. Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a deposit by wire transfer on the same day. Ms. Lin signed the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the payee, stipulating that if the buyer did not want to purchase the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale and payment methods, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, causing the formal contract to be delayed.  Considering that the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, Ms. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu a few days later. Mr. Liu was disappointed and angry that he had almost bought the house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract, only to find that the seller did not sell it.  Therefore, Mr. Liu sued Ms. Lin in the Yongjia People's Court. The court held that since the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract terms, it could not be solely attributed to the defendant, and it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty for the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit to the plaintiff.  After the first instance ruling, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.  【Legal Reminder】In the transaction process, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence. When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property has been occupied by others, and stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.
Restaurant Review: Jiangchang Restaurant (Wudu Branch)  Environment: Medium-sized and well-structured.  Service: Quick service.  Recommended dishes: "Ancient Method Mala Cake" is a must-try dish. The cake is very fragrant, soft, and delicious. If you like desserts, you must try "Dongjiang Ink Fish and Tofu Porridge". The soup is very flavorful, the tofu is very fresh, and the... The taste of the meat dishes is also very good. The service is enthusiastic.  It's been a long time since I've been to Jiangchang Restaurant. The fruit platter is still as good as I remember. The first time I tried the steamed bun, it had the southern softness and flavor that I love! The porridge is just right in terms of dryness and moisture, and the portion is very generous. The signature Siyi chicken wings are still as good as ever, and the soup is also not bad. The garlic is processed quite well... The taste is very good, and the service is enthusiastic. The meat dishes are also very good.  Jiangchang Restaurant used to be a popular online presence a long time ago, located in Dongdan, with wooden floors. There's always a long wait at the entrance, and the clay pot rice always takes a long time to cook... I haven't been to Jiangchang Restaurant for a few years, and there are now many small shops offering Cantonese cuisine, which has dispersed the customer flow. It's rare to be able to get a seat right away, and the quality of the dishes is still as good as ever.  The taste is very good, and the meat dishes are particularly recommended. Jiangchang Restaurant has been around for a long time and is a well-known establishment. However, with the rise of various small shops offering Cantonese cuisine, the popularity of Jiangchang Restaurant has diminished.  Jiangchang Restaurant offers takeout service.  Food: The dishes this time were a bit disappointing. The three-cup chicken had a bit too much vegetables and not enough chicken meat. The main seasoning was a bit off, with a lack of salty flavor, which made the sweetness more prominent. Everyone can try adding some sweetness and various seasonings to balance the dish.  Overall, Jiangchang Restaurant is still a good choice for Cantonese cuisine, but it's not as popular as it used to be.

Translation:  Golden Madame Wedding Photography (South Street Store) currently does not have a branch. Before the photo shoot, we did not have a scheduled time, so we had to change it twice. Our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos. Golden Madame's staff, including the consultant, makeup artist, and photographer, were all praised. It was my first time having a professional makeup done, and I was amazed at how good I looked. Shao Jie and another sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) did a great job with the makeup, and it was very natural. The outdoor photos were taken at Jiangwan City. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and quickly arranged them if they looked a little messy. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy throughout the day. When we chose the photos, we didn't want to delete too many photos online, but when we chose the photos, we didn't add any extra ones. We just took the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin who took a similar amount of time to take wedding photos with Golden Madame added over 10,000 extra photos, and I was shocked at the time. I was also afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos have been edited, and Lan Lan sent them to me. I looked at two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me re-edit them. When I compared the photos of my sister-in-law who had taken photos before, I felt that our photos were much more satisfactory. They were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Golden Madame to take wedding photos! Package price: 3999 yuan. Golden Madame, thank you for your help, and I wish you all the happiness and prosperity in the world! How much is this package?

I think you look very beautiful, would you be interested in participating in a reality show?" You are very suspicious and afraid that this is a scam. He gives you his business card, and you find out that he is a director of a large entertainment company in Japan. "If you have time, we can go to the company and talk. The pay won't be too low." You hesitantly follow him to the company, and he says that he saw you on the street and is very eager for you to participate. You think about the possibility of making some money without losing anything, and you sign the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show that is divided into two parts. In the first part, celebrities and civilians will live together and develop chemistry in real life. In the second part, they will enter a game together and face challenges.

3200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the disruption of special anti-forgery paper supply. (Borneo Post, 11th October) The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the stock of special anti-forgery paper ran out, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, with a total of 3,200 affected people so far. However, the department's director, KRU Amins, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and they will be issued as soon as the special anti-forgery paper arrives next week. He explained the issue at a press conference, responding to a media report that the problem with issuing birth certificates in Sabah has been unresolved for 10 months. He said that one of the reasons for the problem was that the Chinese factory producing the special anti-forgery paper was affected by the epidemic and delayed the delivery to Malaysia. He explained that the anti-forgery paper used for birth certificates in Sabah is different from other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRU Amins revealed that the latest batch of special anti-forgery paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 6th December and was handed over to the printing company on 8th December for partial printing work. "Our staff will go to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the paper and bring it back to Sabah for the final printing. It is estimated that it will take about two working days (20th December) to distribute to applicants," he said. "We will inform applicants to go to the respective branches to collect their birth certificates." He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.

I will continue to use it for a while and then evaluate it. It is not bad, not bad. I checked the serial number of the machine in Hong Kong and felt that it was not big, but rather heavy. Although it is a bit heavier than a 15.6-inch machine, it is stable when running and does not feel slow. The fan noise when dissipating heat is loved, and there is no sound like a game that keeps turning things on and off. The service is good, and the seller reminded me to update the BIOS and responded promptly. It is worth it! The heat dissipation effect is good, and the weight is convenient for carrying. The appearance material is traditional ThinkPad design, which is satisfactory. The seller is trustworthy, and I carefully checked the entire machine, all interfaces, and there were no signs of wear or use, which is a brand new machine with the same configuration as the page. I forgot to order a backpack, but the seller immediately helped me send one, although it was not the original factory backpack, but the service follow-up was good enough to prove that it was a conscientious seller. If you need to buy a notebook, I recommend returning to the seller. The appearance material is stylish, and the display effect is clear and sharp. The weight is moderate, and the heavier the thing feels better. The heat dissipation effect will be evaluated later.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work at land port cities. The notice requires that individuals who have been out of the country for more than 48 hours and are planning to enter land port cities (excluding those with land port cities bordering Hong Kong and Macao) must provide a negative nucleic acid test result within the past 48 hours. After arriving at the land port city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date when each province, autonomous region, or municipality determines the scope of land port cities and announces it to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that qualified land port cities can set up buffer zones for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction.  According to the notice, for some land port cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent cross-border traffic between the two sides. Implementing differential management policies can turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.  Recently, China has experienced several local outbreaks of the epidemic, all of which were imported from overseas through land port cities. The notice pointed out that this exposed some problems such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate management of high-risk personnel, insufficient implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, poor management of cold chain logistics, irregular management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies.  The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism at land port cities, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in land port city epidemic prevention and control, and do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work, tightening the defense line against the import of the epidemic.  The notice emphasizes that land port cities should integrate epidemic prevention and control with the guarantee of people's livelihood, and study and deploy it in parallel with the people's livelihood guarantee work. The hotline for people's livelihood guarantee should be published and communicated in a timely manner, and problems in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices should be regularly checked and solved.  According to the notice, the land port cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, and autonomous regions), prefecture-level cities, and directly-administered municipalities where land ports are located, as well as the cities, autonomous regions, and municipalities where they are located. The specific scope is to be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) according to the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

One after another, these anti-human crimes have aroused more and more hatred and anger from the Afghan people. As the video says, the "anti-terrorism" war waged by the United States "becomes more and more terrifying." The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but has only brought a country full of scars and destruction, and countless acts of killing and destruction. Click on the video, let's expose together the truth of the United States' "anti-terrorism" war of bloodthirsty killing, pierce through the hypocrisy and false face of American-style democracy!
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it cooled down, it became hard and brittle, making it impossible to eat. The soup also spilled out.
Immediately cancel it. The things sent by #PRS\_ORG# must have cooled down. I haven't received them yet! #NAME# said that no one went to pick them up. We've already called. If you don't refund, I'll report the police.
Several times using #PRS\_ORG#, today's experience is the worst. I cannot accept it. It is good, but please remind the restaurant and the driver to avoid it from happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time. The time keeps delaying and I don't know when it will arrive. If I cancel the order, can I get a refund for the money?
How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
One hour ago, a rider was confirmed who was unwilling to wait any longer.
Don't scare people into taking action at the starting line - Xinhua Net. When browsing books at a book fair, you can often feel the heat of successful self-help books. Today's successful self-help books often tout the "best principle" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental stage of "how to do it." As a result, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are all-out efforts or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100 or they are 0; either you climb the Great Wall or you wait at the original place. This "best principle" is widely recognized as "absolutely correct," but it scares 99% of people into submission at the starting line. This is because this theory advocates a path of "suffering and making a 180-degree transformation," which is the fatal weakness of many people. For those who are rigid in following rules, stubborn in adhering to old ways, and resistant to change, it is self-deception to shout at them to "transform." In most cases, people are paralyzed in front of the word "transformation," unable to take the first step, or they make a rash decision and take the first step, but they often fail after a short while and give up. Master Ma's famous "From Tomorrow" routine in his comedy routine best exemplifies this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's ability, making them "sigh and admire" from afar. Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a way to help more ordinary people achieve relative success. The core of the "second-best principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "achieving great victories through small victories," that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb the Great Wall, climbing the small sand hill in front of your house is okay, because that is also stronger than standing still. In short, doing something is always better than doing nothing. Since the threshold has been lowered significantly, this has increased the possibility of ordinary people persisting and increasing their chances of success. However, the success path of the "second-best principle" is slightly longer than that of the "best principle." In summary, although the "best principle" appears to be a flag for everyone to succeed, it ultimately only motivates a small number of people; while the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.

According to a report from the reporter Li Xiaofeng and Zhang Hongxiao of Xinhua News Agency, the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the protection period in 2002, the cumulative increase is more than 40 times. Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Qinghai fish", is a rare and precious fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake catchment area.  In the 20th century, the Qinghai Lake carp was severely depleted due to factors such as excessive fishing and deteriorating breeding habitat. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2,592 tons. In 2004, it was listed as an endangered species in the "Red Data Book of Chinese Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries, prohibiting any units, collectives, or individuals from fishing, selling, or processing Qinghai Lake carp and its products.  At the same time, various measures such as artificial breeding and releasing, river channel cleaning, and designing scientific and reasonable "passageways" for fish have been continuously strengthened to protect the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp. As of now, the total number of artificially bred and released Qinghai Lake carp has reached nearly 1.8 million, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources.  Qinghai Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the water bodies of Qinghai Lake, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, various measures have been taken this year to ban fishing in the key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Huang River, and Qinghai Lake, and to establish a comprehensive ban on fishing management system.

Restaurant only gave me a bag, need to put things in it, weather is cold.
Translation:  Would you like to know if the takeout is packed in a bag? We only see one bag. We think it might have been accidentally left behind, or maybe someone took it. Thanks.
It has already been an hour and the package has not been delivered yet.
Today is the Lunar New Year, and the delivery is quite disappointing. It would be great if you could arrange takeout meals for the little ones to eat. I hope that even in the busy store, there will be a check on the products.
Is a foot bath with bubbles and tingling feet a sign of leakage? Choosing an appropriate foot bath can bring good therapeutic effects, and today's US small editors will answer this question for you. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, foot baths and traditional household electrical appliances sell well, but foot baths do not have their own industry standards, so there are certain safety risks. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as whether it can be used at the highest temperature, which groups of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, and so on. However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may have been produced without strict quality control during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. You can also test with a pen at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline News - Hunan Daily Network - China Sound Online - Hunan Daily December 10, 2022 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Shanwu, Hu Minmin, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photography: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Hope Red Tea Promotion Conference was held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-yuan tea industry. The Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, He Xunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony. Academician Lou Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the red tea source in New Hope and the rise of red tea as the new impetus for "Five Colors of Xiang Tea" during the opening ceremony. In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan tea industry in Hunan, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five Colors of Tea". Tea industries in the province have increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main force, promoting the integration of tea tourism in the main tea-producing areas, driving tea farmers to increase income. The wind turns, and red tea is on the rise again. Tea industry experts in the province said that after completing green tea and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens continues to rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and New Hope welcomed the "source of Hunan Red Tea". In the New Hope Red Tea Exhibition Hall, tea merchants from Fujian were impressed by a high-mountain tea named "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order. The Secretary-General of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhen, said happily that the epidemic and other factors may have affected the tea leaf market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea expo, the highlights were abundant. The red tea of New Hope injected the cultural connotation of tea, and the popularity and trading were hot, welcoming a new spring for the Hunan tea industry.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled? I don't want them, because I can't stop here, and he couldn't bring them.

I haven't received the order, and after checking, there are no food items. No one has contacted me to cancel the order. Usually, when there is takeout food, the building management will call, and after asking, they will let the person in first. But the management has never contacted me before.

I demand that you cancel it immediately, otherwise, I will report to the police.
Time Travel Photography [Effect] Picture Effect: I took two outfits and overall it's not bad. I really like this set of pictures. [Service] Service Details: Because I was pregnant, I was a bit uncomfortable during the makeup process. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest while they continued to take care of me. They also kept giving me hot water to drink. The package price is 1000 yuan. Thank you for your review, Cute Rabbit. Originally, I was going to refuse to shoot in a traditional style, but the final product was simply too beautiful. Thank you for your recognition, and your satisfaction means a lot to us. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really amazing. I strongly recommend all friends to come! From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-processing, there is nothing to complain about. The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and she will match a makeup style that suits you based on your style. The makeup products used are all first-line brands. Teacher Tian is also very professional in photography. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little cats playing around. We are working in Beijing, and many good photo studios need to be queued up for half a year in Beijing. Our colleagues who have been to Beijing have said that the final product is just so-so. We specially searched for this studio, which is a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is a common problem for most people. The photographer, Xiaohong, will take pictures of our natural and exciting moments. The makeup artist, the photographer, and the post-processing team are all excellent. The final product and the people around us all praised it. We have already recommended our friends to come, and our friends who have just watched the film are also very satisfied. We hope that such a studio will not be buried, and more people will discover it and shoot according to their own style, rather than following the same formula. Thank you very much for your five-star review, Caiqing and Jingling. You are both very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best to complete the work to the satisfaction of our customers. Thank you for your support and recognition. The assistant is sweet and friendly, and the photographer teacher is lively and energetic. Each member of the team is very nice. It was a beautiful and unforgettable shooting experience, and the effect of the shooting was better than I imagined. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘 Thank you for your review, Xiaoyu. It's great to meet you all. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is like a journey of several thousand kilometers. I'm very happy to meet you all. If we have the opportunity, we'll come to Qinhuangdao to play again next time.
How do I give money? The re-sent meal has already been sent.
There is no rider to receive. The restaurant staff is calling me now.
A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training institution, but if you don't have this idea, self-study is still a good choice. After all, training costs a lot of money and takes 6 months to learn. However, if you plan to dive into this industry, training is a good choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, look at the strength of the instructors in this institution. If the instructors are not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong instructors. Second, investigate the training institution before choosing it. It is best to investigate the students of the institution, after all, only the students of the institution know whether the institution is good or not, and whether the courses are good or not.  Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have any information about your situation. Learning this stuff depends on your personal situation, such as your major, age, and the language you want to learn, as well as where you are located. If you are a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer major who has graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Now many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the learning cost is high, and the investment of time is also relatively large, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. But if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can find them on B station, or you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.  If you are not a computer major but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning money and time costs, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teachers' explanations are also very detailed. There are people who can answer your questions, and there is also help with learning planning and supervision. In addition, many training institutions have signed employment agreements, with internal recommendation positions, and after studying, they can be recommended to companies. This can save you a lot of trouble when interviewing for a job.  That's my opinion. I didn't explain it in detail before because I didn't know your situation. If you have other questions to consult, you can communicate with me at any time.
I said 1 point before, I saw it on all apps.
What do you call "I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?"
The following is a translation of a document from Chinese to English:  Translation:  Thank you to everyone who has silently given me a thumbs up. With hard work and perseverance, life can be tiring but it's important to keep going. Life won't disappoint those who put in effort. If you like my work, please follow me. Thank you to everyone who has silently given me a thumbs up. Life is like this, others only see the results, but we face it with perseverance. We have no choice but to move forward, we can't go back the way we came... Cleaning is a job and a responsibility, but it's also an art. We may do the dirtiest work, but we approach every corner of the customer's home with the most sincere attitude, and when we see the customer's satisfaction and raised thumbs, it's all worth it. Our efforts will be rewarded!  My daily work - your requirements, my service. With heart and sincerity, we clean and keep things clean, leaving only beauty. You care about the details, and we make your home "clean" to the best of our ability, serving our love for the home.  Clean and tidy for every family, a monument for our cleaning services, service at the right place, cleanliness in every home.  Indoor and outdoor cleaning. Although the crystal lamp is beautiful, it will lose its luster if not cleaned regularly. Only after cleaning can it shine with its full color. Life is the same, doing things with sincerity is the key to success. Paying attention to details and crafting with precision is what we do.  Give me a chance, and I will make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your recognition is what motivates me the most!  Currently, all industries are tough, but I believe that as long as we have a sincere attitude, perseverance, and effort, we will be better than others. At least we won't be sitting and complaining, right?  One day's plan begins with the morning. All the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything you desire. Maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning!  When we were young, happiness was something we possessed, and having it made us happy. As we grew up, happiness became a goal we sought, and achieving it made us happy. As we matured, we realized that happiness is a state of mind, and understanding it makes us happy.  Be the best version of yourself, act according to your heart, and there will be no regrets in life. Life is one journey, and we should walk our own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a happy heart, live a beautiful life until old age!  At every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges. Often, what limits us is not our ability, but our courage to face it. If we can't avoid it, let's face it bravely. The more afraid we are, the more we will be defeated by difficulties; if we face them head-on, problems will eventually be solved.
Saudi Arabia's First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition Held in Riyadh - Xinhua Net  RIYADH, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The first biennial exhibition of contemporary art in Saudi Arabia was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the art district of JAX in the northwest of the capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.  The biennial exhibition was jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. UCCA Center for Contemporary Art Director Tian Weidong served as the art director of the exhibition.  According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of cultural development in Saudi society.  The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is divided into six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among others. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also highly anticipated, some of whom use innovative ways to create art using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Mountains of the River" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.  The CEO of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, Bakkili, said that he hoped that this biennial exhibition could establish an international dialogue and allow audiences around the world to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative communities in Saudi Arabia. Tian Weidong said, "The goal of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, enabling Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."  During the opening week of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and experts, curators, and opinion leaders in the art and creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Comprehensive and Standardized Management of Rural Public Welfare Posts - Xinhua Net, December 12, 2022 (reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continue to do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, and to consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security recently issued policies to promote the standardized management of rural public welfare posts, which will help promote the comprehensive development of rural areas.  At present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million rural public welfare posts, which are used to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken populations. These posts have played an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment income growth, consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.  This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Department of Human Resources and Social Security, the Rural Revitalization, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of objects for recruiting rural public welfare post personnel, financial management, post development, and post management, etc.  In terms of post development, the new regulation clarifies that posts should be set up according to "demand-oriented, post-based, dynamic management, and quantitative control" principles, and the principles of "who develops, who uses, who is responsible, and one person per post, voluntary public disclosure, and unified management" should be followed. The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, hiring, pre-job training, and on-the-job training.  In addition, the new regulation also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare posts, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare posts, and requires that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare posts purchase commercial accident insurance for the rural public welfare post placement personnel. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation of rural public welfare posts.
Address is wrong. Hello. Can you cancel the order? I will re-order. Has the order been canceled?
二、Although right-wing forces have had their moments in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight and break out in a sweat when they get a little bit of water. As soon as they show some determination, they are immediately attacked and defeated. However, in the process of social progress, the right-wing has played a positive role. From ending the definition of truth during the Cultural Revolution to promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.  三、Although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he says and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person because he is sincere, sincere about China, and sincere about China's social problems. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary and that revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties.  四、Changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunism and seeking personal gain will only lead to confusion and chaos. Let's talk about the left. The left is actually a group of discarded products of history and politics. If the right has some positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost its way because it only wants what the Communist Party has discarded!  五、Recently, I saw some friends panicking and arguing with each other about the right and the left. They were very passionate, but I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with the Han collaborators and the leftists. It's all nonsense. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the right-wingers and leftists admit that we are right. Why bother? I tell my friends that when the right-wingers curse us as "five blacks" and the leftists curse us as "right dogs," it proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but as they grew older, they forgot about them or pursued them, but ended up becoming dogmatic.  Left and right, in general, refer to constraints and freedom. China's overall tendency towards leftism is due to its innate genetic predisposition from its historical and cultural background. The right-wing in China emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes supervision and safety. Nowadays, society as a whole is more concerned about fairness, and with the competition between China and the United States, leftism is confirmed, and it is likely to continue for many years to come. Although I don't understand it, I'll just say that it's all very biased.
Can't wait until 19:06, I've already placed an order for 2 hours 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [strange searches]. What is normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lunar New Year, the rise of good friends, and the commodity price event. Public opinion spreads and forms a wave, then [decreases exponentially] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there may be a small peak reappear. They look exactly the same as the [network public opinion evolution model] displayed on the official website of the network administration bureau.  What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present [isolated peaks], [jagged peaks], and [cliff-like peaks]. [Isolated peaks] refer to human-induced heating, quickly rising to the top of the hot search list and attracting public attention; [jagged peaks] refer to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search list; [cliff-like peaks] refer to collective withdrawal, the hot search having fulfilled its "function", being assigned to a new task, and moving to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's hotness is exactly the trough of another event's hotness, and the time difference is only a few seconds, which must be due to a coordinated attack by the water army, launching a new round of offensives.  The professionalization of black public relations can be seen: several hot searches are simultaneously on the podium, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for publicity, which ones create warfare, which ones divert the line of sight, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, which ones are bundled with judgments, and which ones are refined in terms of nodes and batches. Almost all factors of public opinion dissemination are considered.  Dissemination is a science, discarding subjective factors such as standpoints and emotions, and only from objective data, black public relations also has no place to hide. Every step leaves a trace, and these traces, we dig them out together.  Data source: hot search time machine.
Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency on December 12. Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on December 10, with one case involving a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27, and the other involving a local resident who had contact with a person who had recently traveled from South Africa and tested positive for the virus on November 30. Both patients were isolated and treated at the hospital, and their nucleic acid test results turned negative after treatment. Cyprus reported its first three cases of the Omicron variant on December 10, all of whom were students who returned to Cyprus from abroad earlier this month. They are all mild cases and have not been hospitalized. The government of Cyprus is increasing its efforts to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. Starting from December 6, all passengers over the age of 12 who enter Cyprus by plane will be required to take a nucleic acid test at the airport at their own expense. Cyprus's health department also announced on December 10 that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. Malawi's health minister, Khumbize Chiponda, said on December 9 that the country had discovered its first three cases of the Omicron variant. The country's health department sequenced the genes of 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the three cases.

大美360集成家装 地址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼 一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。 来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。 我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。 他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。 我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。 这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。 他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。 除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。 我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。 当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。 无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。 各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。 坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。 所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。 以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。 想要向商家提问，请先登录或注册 严禁发布各种形式的商家点评，详细请见商户收录声明 大众点评昆明装修设计频道为您提供
This is so terrifying. If you don't cancel the order within 30 minutes, please do so!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, if you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue the matter.
I asked if 15 minutes is too short to cancel.
The chicken soup should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it.
I haven't received a response in 3 days... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan! The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card to pay, and now I have to pay for shipping every time. Can you waive the shipping fee temporarily and collect my monthly fee after you have investigated? Would that be okay?

It's already 3 o'clock. Shouldn't you give me compensation for the delivery? But the rider just left the package at the door and left, and it was delivered incorrectly.
Your delivery rider has already taken my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting. The rider received my order at 19:25, but they are still not willing to leave. I have finished ordering, but I still have to wait. What should I do? Where did your rider go? Do I still have to wait?
I am going to send a complaint. If you don't cancel it, I will report it to the police.
However, my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

Here's the translation:  If you need to add a discount code, that's fine. Just remember not to resend it, as I have already purchased it and don't want to waste it. Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks. In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but such behavior must be eliminated. If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized behavior. From the moment you send me a friend request on Facebook and start posting provocative posts, to your attempt to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude. Later, you not only continued to tag me at a frequency of one post per day, but also continued to discuss about me with your so-called friends on Facebook in a disrespectful and humiliating manner, commenting on my appearance, figure, diet, and even what kind of fruit I plant in my bed, whether I should or should not insert it, and so on. I... I've had enough.  After I reported the news, you completely ignored it and became even more arrogant. I don't care what your political background is or what your identity is, in our society, it is necessary to respect both genders. Yes, you can continue with such provocative, obscene, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, you can continue to believe that this is not your post or continue to publish all kinds of attacking language. But I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't even want to recognize you, and I don't think any woman would want to be humiliated like this in exchange for fame.  When my friends asked me if I was okay, I said I was, but I don't think you would believe it. I don't think any woman could be so humiliated and still say she's okay. Whether in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who lack basic ethics would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice will be served. I have taken note of some of the comments and will share them with everyone. You yourself cannot impersonate me, can you? I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
I have reported and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What's the use of a cow without any meat? It's just a mouth-watering chicken. Fresh meat is impossible to eat.
Are you sure the food is freshly cooked and not leftovers?

The following document is a review of a home appliance store located at No. 55, High-speed Railway North Road, Shayibake District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China. The reviewer describes the store as having a complete selection of home appliances from various well-known brands, and offers a discount on water purifiers during the Double 12 event. The store has 11 floors, with the second and third floors being parking areas, and parking is free during the day. The surroundings of the store are not very impressive, with few restaurants and hardware stores, and the taste of the food in the restaurants is average. The elevator in the store is also unresponsive, and it takes a long time to go up and down between floors. The reviewer suggests that the store needs to improve and develop more areas. The address of the store is No. 555, High-speed Railway North Road, Shayibake District, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China, and it is conveniently located with a large parking lot and free parking during the day. The environment of the store is spacious, with 8-9 floors, offering a wide selection of home furnishings, household appliances, and various small items from many well-known brands such as Midea, Haier, Suning, Lao Boss, Yuedian, Foshan, Yadan, and more. The reviewer recommends the store as a good place to shop for home appliances and suggests that visitors can take a break and sit on the sofa after they are done shopping. The reviewer is currently undecided on whether to buy a comfortable sofa, as they have seen many options at the store, including those from Midea and Meike Home, but they are hesitant due to the slightly higher prices.

The Yangtze River's upstream green integrated service area has been fully covered - Xinhua Net, December 11, 2021 (reporter Wang Xian) The Changjiang River upstream green integrated service area in Chongqing was officially put into operation on December 10, following the opening of the downstream water-based green integrated service area in Yibin, Sichuan Province. This is the second water-based green integrated service area on the Yangtze River upstream after the Yibin area was officially put into operation. With this, the water-based green integrated service area has covered the entire upstream, middle, and downstream of the Yangtze River.  The Transportation Department's Changjiang River Navigation Management Bureau's deputy director, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that before, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 water-based green integrated service areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which were well received by the majority of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.  The full coverage of the water-based green integrated service area is another milestone event in the construction of green Yangtze River shipping, and the reception and handling of ship pollutants and the service capacity of shipping have been significantly improved. It is introduced that the water-based green integrated service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services for the majority of ships and ship crews, helping them solve the "urgent, difficult, and worried" problems.  This time, the two water-based green integrated service areas on the upstream Yangtze River were officially put into operation, integrating living services, production services, and public services, with environmental protection as the main theme and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as the highlight. They can provide "one-stop berthing and multiple services" for inland ships, making the work of ship crews more efficient and their lives more convenient.

The joint exercise "Peaceful Relief-2021" between the armed forces of China and Vietnam has been successfully concluded. All participating Chinese teams have safely returned to China's Guangxi territory, marking the completion of a seven-day training mission.  During this joint exercise, the armed forces of China and Vietnam focused on the topic of humanitarian medical relief and tightly adhered to the mission of emergency aid and disaster relief. They completed joint emergency command, joint on-site rescue, and mass treatment of casualties, among other topics, in accordance with practical standards, effectively enhancing the ability of both sides to provide emergency aid.  The results of the exercise have been recognized by both sides. The chairman of the exercise directing committee of the Vietnamese side, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, said at the closing ceremony that Vietnamese military doctors have learned about the organization and professional activities of the exercise from Chinese military doctors, as well as about China's medical and support equipment. The results of the exercise prove the professional capabilities of the military medical forces of both countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention.  The chairman of the Chinese guidance and coordination group, Chen Chunming, deputy director of the Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, said that this exercise is another innovative practice based on the successful joint medical examination in 2018, with very important milestone significance.
