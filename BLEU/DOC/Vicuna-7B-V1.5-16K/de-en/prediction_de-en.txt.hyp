The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's value... I am a #PRS\_ORG# major customer and therefore it is not a problem for me. I only need a number or instruction on how to package the item so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
A few days ago, I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# for 249€. Today, it costs 179€. To be honest, I find that very annoying. Do I have to cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally believe that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I also think it's good for older siblings to help out with the younger ones to some extent. They can take turns watching them, bringing them a drink, etc. This helps them learn responsibility, contribute to the family, and feel involved. As long as they are still able to handle their own age-appropriate tasks, I don't see a problem with this. If your K1 is content to be alone for a short time and it's okay for him, that's fine. You can best assess whether this works for your children. It's not like he has to take care of K2 and stay up with him for hours on end. From a legal standpoint, it may be questionable. Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement exists. If something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether you're willing to take that risk is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book! I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I just can't remember the title. Maybe someone here knows... The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself with food and going to his raptors' enclosure. The case is taken over by a commissioner who soon becomes suspicious of his therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats fear patients. The commissioner has a niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up in this therapist's clinic. There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned by the therapist to go to the scene of each suicide and document and post the photos on the internet. At least it turns out in the end that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses their fear center, and the patients are ultimately forced to confront their fears to the extreme (a woman jumps out of a window, another one drives herself to death on purpose). This confrontation with fear is referred to in the book as "the fight". In the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that has something to do with fire. That's roughly the plot, and I'm pretty sure that the book was written by a French author/authoress. If anyone knows this plot or even has the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available. I have to contact my husband, but that could take a while. What steps should I take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter unter dem Daumennagel Kind, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumb nail (outside). Have tried to remove it with tweezers. Very difficult to grasp. Did not work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to remove it. No chance left. Going to the doctor tomorrow.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0. LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and come with a large 11x15mm "sugar cube" loudspeaker with sound capsule construction kit. Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder. He masters the data format DCC just as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are just as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions. Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register at an appropriate digital central. He masters all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, with suitable centrals, the CV values on the main track can be read out. For centrals that only program CVs from 1-255 can exist helper registers. Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses. Three more Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes reprogramming with the honorable Control Unit 6021 possible. The M4 protocol allows automatic registration at mfx®-compatible centrals. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking tracks just as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system. Breaking with DCC brake stones or with direct current is also possible. In addition, he also holds at a Selectrix® braking diode. An ABC pendulum automatic allows automatic switching between two stations. The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC tracks.
After my coupon, which was not delivered due to a complaint that did not reach me, is no longer eligible for extension, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place a new order elsewhere where customer friendliness is higher and I don't have to type in my fingers for nothing to achieve nothing! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omicron: Johnson will accelerate the vaccination rollout In response to the rapidly increasing number of Omicron cases, politics and science in the UK are working to accelerate the vaccination rollout. By New Year's Eve, therefore, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccination offer. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson aims to progress with the COVID-19 vaccinations faster than previously planned due to the rapid increase in Omicron cases. Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, as long as at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening. So far, the target date was at the end of January. The British government will provide additional support to ensure that the vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland are also accelerated. Johnson emphasized the need to strengthen the vaccine protection in the face of the Omicron variant, which is why a booster dose is urgently needed. The good news is that the vaccine effectiveness can be increased with a third dose. "Get boosted now!" Johnson said. On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were reported in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137. This was an increase of 65 percent compared to the previous day. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent out a job application. Today, I received an invitation to a meeting via email. I want to respond to the email, but unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a more complicated name. I have googled him/her and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman. **I have no idea how to write the email now. Could someone please help me? ** I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any toes. Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it. 4 of them are going. Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an invisible defect at the time of sale. How can such a cushion defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First, on the #PRS\_ORG# tried. That works but has been failing for about 14 days now. Therefore, I have been buying the last books always through the website and then reading them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# but wanted to buy 8. However, there were none left. Now they are available again, and I would like to ask you to add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here. I just need to get something off my chest. As a professional, I come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons. A topic that really gnaws at me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them. Of course, I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect. But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations. I see the blue marks, the blood, the desperate eyes... Even in a private conversation with the perpetrator, far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach everyone. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even on the verge of tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to endure violence. Often, I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. But it will never be easier. Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What use is the series to "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Disastrous Derby Defeat for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim  At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, was left out. Again, nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs." However, this anger did not subside after the game, but rather intensified due to the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone was disappointing, it was the way the team performed that was even more disappointing. For example, a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was only 13 percent, with four shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? John Patrick's answer: "We were not concentrated enough after our victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained." In other words, moving the ball. His opponent, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "It was an amazing game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like in front of 10,000 people." Meanwhile, only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made up for it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team to victory. "The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim. Meanwhile, in Patrick's team, the key performers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a total disaster and came within eight points of a comeback, after they had already trailed 39:59. In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points. Luckily, there is not much time left for brooding. Already on Wednesday (7:00 p.m.), the Riesen will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before they also play in Ludwigsburg in front of a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.

As Precise as Peeled Eggs: Max Raabe turns 59 He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Morning, Dear Luck" - if he even gets to perform. Actually, Max Raabe had wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. But nothing will come of it. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official orders" to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Other concerts planned for the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de). From January, the artists will then try to make up for the concerts they had to postpone in 2020 due to the pandemic. Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe sang a lot as a teenager. He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986 founded the Palast Orchester with fellow students. Since then, the baritone has established himself in the style of the Comedian Harmonists with his repertoire of hits and chanson songs. He has been awarded many prizes. His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women, That's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream. Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair strictly combed back and attentive to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be overlooked from the current German-speaking music scene. With the program "Good Morning, Dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance? It could be used to complement the existing furniture and we could check if it matches in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only flip the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing The new Federal Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin. "With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years. A mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is the best protection against monopolization. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission, as recommended by the popular vote. However, if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz has just started talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on landlord increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent cap. I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible. If the rental market does not calm down, "we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I noticed after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment. Unfortunately, the product is no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock? Or if it will come back at all? #PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Gift sounds great. Then I will self-declare it in the new order. Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut my finger off. That is an absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky A devastating storm system has drawn numerous tornadoes across the United States. Alone in Kentucky, there could be more than 100 dead. The pictures from there look like a war zone. On the night before Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the United States and may have demanded up to a hundred deaths. The storms leave a trail of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky. Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is hard to believe that this is even possible. He estimates that there could be up to a hundred dead in the state of Kentucky, the official numbers are increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out. That is very unfortunate. Is it still being produced? Or has it been completely removed from the assortment? Is there the possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when should you report? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
As I understand it, I can only order the cover now and have it shipped to Germany from where it is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return request and wanted to inquire if it had arrived or was being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans While the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, Austrian companies have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated. This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today are calling for financial incentives for vaccination. Even the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched companies after complaining about them. This doesn't make his situation any better than yours. Just wait and drink tea. It's been a year now. He has obviously not secured his old position and has been looking for something else. That's fine too. And that he didn't like you back then: well, that's okay. He didn't like his job either. There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation. That will be legally relevant. I will take a screenshot.

Help with my first campaign as a GM! Greetings! I am currently leading a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Griffin's Pass," and I want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign written specifically for the players. We are playing DSA 5. The big book is done, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual actions are planned, and now I am working on writing the starter adventure and I'm already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes have to transport a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea. There, the further plot will develop. A few miles from the village, the heroes will be ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into a trap. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds. Group composition: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers armed. The goblins are lying in wait for the heroes in a ditch and are flanking to the left and right with bows armed the wagon, while two with spears stop the wagon. If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions: 1. The heroes will all be unconscious and will later be found by the village mayor's son, a half-elf, and healed. Of course, the wagon is missing. 2. If an inevitable defeat is imminent, this half-elf with two of his servants will intervene and help the heroes in the fight. The wagon is still there, everything is fine. How do you justify the solution 2 from the Deus ex Machina? Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure? The goblin group will later play a crucial role and is not just cannon fodder.  EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely take many of your ideas into account and now I also have more confidence in my narratives.
I have disassembled and reassembled the lamp again. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Therefore, I would like to send it back anyway. Can you please let the returns come to me so that I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#?

We have nothing to do with the chair. Suddenly, there was a tear there. I was just sitting on it.
Here is the translation:  "Here was the lower part, i.e. the part with the damaged storage. Will everything be collected again or only the storage part?"
I am bored with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has gradually decreased, so I want to vent a bit in this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the start accident put the schedule far behind schedule, the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) could still have been shown. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE here probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it is still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end. Nevertheless, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were relevant radio messages about this topic to Hamilton. At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this option. I am of the opinion that elementary rules should simply be known if you comment on an F1 race for a pay-TV provider. It is also not the first time that something that is now allegedly possible or prescribed according to rules has caused confusion, both have simply had constant uncertainties in the topic of rules. Generally, I don't like the artificial commenting style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. But what really bothers me is the serious unprofessionalism, such as ordering coffee by the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher. Especially the latter brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he clearly does not take seriously. Not least, advertising takes over completely at Sky, in the final stretch Sky is the only provider that goes into advertising, as you can listen to the German soundtrack without commentary directly after the race on F1TV. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two providers make less advertising during the training sessions than Sky, and as free-TV providers. Although I have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking provider that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising. So the magnificent F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable provider. I would be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and hasn't been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and nothing has happened. The First Lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check her email and send it, but she never did.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 2019. One of them has already shown a defect (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair). I would appreciate your support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen. It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air lifter. This series is offered in 3 variants by us. Take a look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can see the performance in comparison. If the pumps are strong enough, entire systems can be operated with them. If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that more diffusers can be connected. The MK series has 1, 2 or 4 outlets, depending on the model. Fan pumps are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function. Here you could mention a treasure chest, a shell or something similar. The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise. The installation is very easy. The fan pump is connected to an outlet 4/6 mm via an air hose... and it can start. The fan pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan pump is mounted lower than the water level, a backflow valve should be inserted between them. Cut the air hose and insert the valve in between. This would prevent water from flowing backward if once water flows backward in the tank... If the fan pump is mounted outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy. Even though we specify the processing time here on eBay with 3 days, they are packed daily and the packages are also picked up daily. If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly. We only want to prevent misunderstandings, so that no one is dissatisfied, just because something takes a little longer. It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics... of course, here Corona doesn't stop either. Please don't judge immediately, just because the delivery takes longer, that lies exclusively with the parcel services. Everyone naturally complains about these services, even though we say... they have it damn hard. This is also very regionally different. Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there will also be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Is it also possible to order the legs in a lighter color?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV host into space  The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have embarked on a short trip to space. They were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, on Saturday. The launch and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western US state of Texas. Bezos personally welcomed the newly knighted astronauts after their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule. Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers stepped out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were in space for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers paid for their tickets: space travel engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets. Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced about her father's mission after the short flight. He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions. She simply tagged along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic. He would like to return to space immediately, said the host.  "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers  The "New Shepard" rocket system flies largely automatically. The capsule, which was released from the rocket during the flight, reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, briefly experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked down by large parachutes and landed. The International Aviation Federation and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned space flight of Blue Origin: in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman. In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous worldwide with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was on board, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without consideration for the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in a color or cycle through its entire color palette. When a color change is requested, the light stone maintains a light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light fixture ensures year-round outdoor use. Even in snowy environments, its lighting performance is particularly impressive - just keep in mind a shorter charging time when the days are shorter. Please make sure not to let snow interfere with the solar module's function in winter. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if needed. You can also purchase a suitable replacement battery through our webshop to further extend the lifespan of your decorative light.

Someone who works or is studying biochemistry I am currently studying biochemistry and find the subject itself quite exciting, and in the laboratory, it doesn't bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course). Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, thinking that I would definitely study until the doctorate and become a researcher. However, at the moment, I have doubts, especially concerning the job prospects. On the one hand (Studycheck, etc.), one hears constantly great career opportunities and that the profession is highly sought after, on the other hand, one hears constantly about unemployed biologists and poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really be interested in: 1) What are you currently working as? 2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary? 3) What have you studied/what kind of training have you completed? 4) Would you do it all again? Thank you very much for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering dropping out in 2022 and becoming a computer scientist. If you have any experiences, please write them down as well :)
Extra stress during vacation and holiday weekends This topic came up with me last week. But now I had to use my long weekend to relax. Therefore, here is a post about it. Not only before major vacations, such as Christmas vacation, is there a lot of stress in our company. It seems that there is also a lot of stress before holidays and bridge days. In fact, last week was the Assumption of Mary, which is called "Auffahrt" in Switzerland. Most people and businesses take a bridge day on Friday, which is semi-official. Therefore, there was a long 4-day weekend last week. What was going on last week? Stress everywhere. Endless emails that had to be sent out before Auffahrt, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend. Because... well, because? Because "next week then" sounds so much after so much time and that can't be allowed? Or because people take everything seriously in a shortened week and want to achieve as much as in a normal week? I wasn't just stressed on Wednesday, but also really angry. What's the point of this self-sacrifice for holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly? The stress, of course, did not come from above, my colleagues were all very independent in this regard. My question is simply: Are we only Swiss? Is this our reformed-evangelical way of doing things? Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet. "Even if it doesn't snow in Erfurt, you can still go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH. She will get into the holiday spirit by baking and cooking with her son. "I love that," said Catterfeld. But she still has a lot to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, I have to get started now."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moulting and feather regrowth. NECTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg. NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage. The majority of feather damage that occurs in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors. Since the feather consists of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat. For proper metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting is due to inadequate or unbalanced protein supply and/or insufficient provision of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly considered and balanced. During the use of NECTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered. NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be easily administered through the drinking water or the soft food.
Thank you, I found it but it still doesn't work.
a the F-parts are, I have received a bed from you. Unfortunately, there was a problem with one of the parts. The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet. What should we do now? I cannot build the bed. The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are faulty products. The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder. Therefore, I will receive new ones. When will they be sent? No, not flat. These are the correct ones according to the assembly instructions, they were only too narrow. But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose. Here, they are not flat. Could I receive these new ones? Hello #NAME#, could I explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people were lightly injured in a fire in a residential house in Upper Bavaria. In addition, a estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson. The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
However, it comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" early 2021. Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously expressed his vaccination status publicly. Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination. The illness of a friend has moved him to do so, he shared with LinkedIn. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo that shows him receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. In social media, there were false reports that he was not vaccinated. "Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network. "For a few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors." He had previously declined, as the communication should not revolve around him. But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting a severe COVID-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks. The school friend and his family have not been vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask the reasons. "The most common reason seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust." Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences. In the internet, a video interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated. "It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," Şahin said at the time. There is prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and according to his own statements, the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in Transformer Station: Thousands of people without power In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases probably also no heating. A fire had disabled a transformer station. For about 24 hours, thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to cope without power after a fire in a transformer station. At 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communities, the lights went out on Friday evening. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency generators had been in operation until the widespread disturbance could be fully resolved in the late evening. Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered support in schools by providing care places and calling for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and thanked the helpers for their effort. We are very aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions. We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring effort," said the head of the Primary Technology area, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will take a few days, as the Westnetz technicians could only temporarily restore some of the lines, he explained. A technical defect caused the fire, according to company statements. Power is flowing again The fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 has caused significant damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to Westnetz. There, extensive cleaning and repair work is necessary. At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again available. Since Saturday 18:00, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again. Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 21:30. Since 23:15, even the last affected people have had power again. Over 80 Westnetz and partner company technicians have been in operation. The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up a emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It is important now that citizens take care of their neighbors and inform their local fire departments if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting. The focus was on the residents of nursing homes when setting up and operating emergency generators. In addition, temporary care places were established in schools for those who could not care for themselves or needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros? It is the daily ceiling #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you are also having a nice day and stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the undercarriage on the tabletop. It concerns Custom #NAME#. There are 3 versions of it. We wanted to get the one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#, but we got a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# came, but I cannot nest it and thus shorten it. Can you help me further? Otherwise, I would have to send it back as it is not suitable for the purpose. I would appreciate a feedback.
That is really simpler! Then let's do it! Please send me the return receipt via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat. However, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG# before the purchase. Should I do this now?
A such low discount I find almost unbearable. With that, we are not in agreement.
Nordic combination: Riiber wins The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää. The duo had to concede defeat again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Translation:  Return of the order number #NUMBER# When will the money be transferred back to my account?
We both made some changes and are using version 4.5... it's possible that they may have heard of the problem before.
Directly with my #PRS\_ORG#, I bought a book, it seems to be there. When I try to open it, the message comes up, "ups! This document cannot be opened." The file is possibly faulty. They should report this to the customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can they help me further?
"Chat connection is gone and now? I have to work in between!"
To ensure an even and clean application, clean the parts with soap and water, rinse with clear water, and dry them thoroughly. Before using the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2-3 strokes. This can be done on the later non-visible inside of the parts or on a yogurt cup. Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke on the part. Avoid rapid back-and-forth wiping with the brush, as this can create unrealistic looking areas. A model is not a garden fence. Start with the lighter colors. The darker ones may otherwise appear later. Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush. Otherwise, unattractive metallic streaks may occur when they mix with regular colors. Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before gluing them together. Achieve a true-to-life appearance with decals/stickers or transfer pictures. From registration marks on aircraft to ship names, trim and identification numbers on automobiles: Decals give the model the final touch. Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible. It is easier to apply a cockpit to an aircraft or to glue it before it is installed in the fuselage. More important than the right tools such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are time, patience, and a steady hand. Cut each required decal individually and arrange it as needed. Decals are also called water-slide decals because you moisten their back side with water until the carrier paper becomes dark. Then you only peel off a small piece of the paper and place it on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand). While holding the decal on the model with a tool, gently pull the carrier paper to the side. Note: Always check first if the decal is in the right position before completely peeling it off the paper, so that it does not stick, wrinkle, or even tear. Absorb any excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years.
I can only briefly open a book when I am looking for something else, then I no longer want to read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the page until where I have read. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Can I get this through email? Also for all 3 packages? Since the lamp came to me in 3 separate packages.
Ok, despite many thanks! Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned. Can I have the problem resolved easily?
Childbirth Treatment with Health Insurance / What is a "Insurance Case"?  Hello everyone, we have been dealing with childbirth treatment for a while now, but when it comes to billing with the health insurance, it suddenly becomes an issue. Here's what happened:  1. We had applied for childbirth treatment in advance with the health insurance and were promised three attempts. The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.). The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed to the health insurance. A few months later, we tried to have a second child and went through two (unsuccessful) attempts, but these were not yet billed to the health insurance. We applied again for the cost coverage with the health insurance and were granted three more attempts. After a few more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, logically the most expensive ones are billed to the health insurance), we submitted the invoices to the health insurance and received a nasty surprise: instead of five attempts (2+3), the health insurance only wants to reimburse three attempts. The justification: The remaining two attempts of the first promise fall with the pregnancy/birth. The second childbirth wish is considered a new insurance case. However, according to the GTC, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the treatment need no longer exists."  Our questions to the experts here:  * Who is right here, the health insurance (only three attempts will be reimbursed) or us (five attempts are to be reimbursed)? * Should the health insurance have pointed out to us that with a birth, the remaining attempts of the first promise fall? * Is the wish for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child. It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
Okay. We won't be ordering from them anymore. If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer. They can certainly pass this on to their manager. That's not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated, but now you are telling me that I need to return the thing first. I can't really do anything about it since the commode was completely destroyed when it arrived at my place. Please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote. It clearly states that the repayment was initiated, and I haven't received any repayment per #PRS\_ORG# yet.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account, which we will no longer do. No, the defect occurred only after a few months. A desk must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they should not sell it as a desk. Nevertheless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to provide a different type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products promoted with additional hooks that we cannot find? Can you help us?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films  There is no general definition of what a low-budget film is, as there are no exact budget limits. According to Wikipedia, a "low-budget film" or "low-budget movie" is a motion picture that is shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category? What do you find appealing about them? And what might not appeal to you at all?
As a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. The delivery time has been extended again, is this now reliable? Thank you Very much. Is there no phone number, a chat where one can wait 30 minutes, is not a chat! Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will then soon try again because it simply does not work here. Hello
Half Victory Against Belarus with High Costs for the EU Involved According to Raphael Bossong, a political expert, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, but the costs are high and there are significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus-Poland and Belarus-Lithuania borders. Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd) that the EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation and that there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, he added. There is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments, Bossong said, adding that this would make it more difficult for the EU to reach an agreement on asylum policy. The EU is paying a further price for its policy at the Belarus-Poland and Belarus-Lithuania border, Bossong said. The line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened, making it more difficult for the EU to reach an agreement on asylum policy. According to Polish border guards, 55 migrants attempted to enter Poland from Belarus on Sunday night and were taken back to the border. Polish officials were reportedly attacked with stones by the migrants. A soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guards registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had already managed to overcome the border barriers. Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so in recent months. The EU accuses Belarusian strongman Alexander Lukashenko of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU. According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off border sections. The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that transport migrants and refugees to the country. EU commissioners have also traveled to the countries of origin to prevent people from leaving. The most effective element of the EU's response has been the pressure on airlines, according to Bossong. "The EU has put its market power in the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial sanctions," he said. Minsk must also consider internal political costs. The Belarusian society is unlikely to accept that the security apparatus regularly allows thousands of people to pass through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after a controversial Formula 1 finale. Max Verstappen is accused by Mercedes of committing two rule violations during the race. Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection. The Silver Arrows suspect the same two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest is based on a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, when he is alleged to have illegally overtaken. A second objection was filed against the result at the end of the race. According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not complied with. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and celebrated his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutch driver had overtaken other cars in front of him.
I am checking it. I will speak with the bank and thank them again for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag. As the park announces, members and permanent cardholders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day. Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages. The roller coaster trains were lit up with the colors red and white on this day. Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park. Already since the early 1990s, there has been a partnership between the Bundesliga club and the Europa-Park in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag at the Europa-Park, it has again become clear how well the partnership fits. Seeing fans shining with joy as they have fun together on the roller coaster confirms this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

I have submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
It doesn't seem to have everyone the time for your clumsy chat and misdelivered cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you should correct and not all from our household. Contact Frau #NAME#. I can't chat with them every day.
We chatted yesterday and agreed that I/Ms. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a reorder of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return shipping label. I have not received this email yet. I would like to bring the package to #PRS\_ORG# today. Please contact me with kind regards.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything. That's like when an AfD supporter says they have nothing against foreigners. I'm willing to give them both the benefit of the doubt, but Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself, you should just leave it alone. Yeah, then you're just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah. If you seriously question the evolutionary theory, you're completely lost. Of course, if you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense. And with that, you're a science denier and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible. The specifically plan-aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically free of distortion and color errors up to the edge zone. Often, magnifying glasses are marked with enlargement values. However, these values only apply for precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the actual usage conditions. To optimize the use of the magnifying glass, we kindly ask you to take the information in the "Technical Data" table into account (see instruction manual in the packaging). On the surfaces of all optical devices - including magnifying glasses - reflections occur. By using a anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When using the magnifying glass under optimal usage conditions - the magnifying glass close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers. He has already experienced many curious situations at the Christmas tree sale. Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree. He plants around 2,000 trees every year for the sale. The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations. That makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit funny, he says.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, as a customer, I'm gone? At least, I received a defective delivery and now I've paid the full price for it. Then I'll rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both have their name as a result. In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic  We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks now. Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable WiFi network. Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly with a few exceptions and received and transmitted 50 Mbit. The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also come in. However, at the other DLan module, which sends the WiFi, not the full 500 Mbit, but the further I move away from the module with the device, the less comes in (i.e., use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module). This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than DLan, but here too there were similar losses. Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with glass fiber? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables throughout the house. I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created this extra account. Therefore, I would be especially grateful for a response.
When is the right time to switch bank accounts? Who would have thought that in the meantime, there would be rest at the giro accounts, they see themselves deceived. While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past once again with all kinds of tricks from their customers, the negative interest rates continue to fall. For example, the Deutsche Bank was previously considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now she has halved the limit and even reduced the interest rate for savings accounts. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division Postbank - to 50,000 euros for giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings account customers. However, these lower limits now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request. Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as well as at ING Germany. The currently very popular direct bank DKB has lowered the limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks have now a limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox. Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have already been successful in the first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation. Now the banks are already discussing whether they might have to set up reserves - for the case where the upper instances declare the negative interest rates in general as unlawful and have to refund millions to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood. However, her life is like a mountain and valley ride. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year. For her, who made a big splash in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance. At least, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, right: a single chip from the bag). That her heart still flies to the hearts of female and male fans alike is actually a miracle. Maybe because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the big love. And the baby wish has been taken off the list. Before, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother. That hurt her. The people who asked have no idea what is going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. It is hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Quit Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it. After a driving error and a slight bandage, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi after barely half the race distance. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class. For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole, and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 achievements is the goal of the bobsled pilot. "I've calculated it, I would have to drive nine and a half victories per season to achieve it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg. First, he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, as he moved from third to first place. Then he made some changes to the material setting and drove on Sunday with 0.30 seconds a larger lead. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the Brit Brad Hall. Austrian Benjamin Maier finished third. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also drove his 22nd consecutive victory. The Stuttgart-based Johannes Lochner came in fourth this time after finishing second the day before. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do the same," said Lochner. Nolte wins with home victory - Podium for Jamanka  Laura Nolte won her third season victory in the two-man bob on her home track. After only reaching fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory with her pusher Deborah Levi. Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. She achieved both Olympic qualification and her first podium finish this winter. Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished with Leonie Fiebig in third place. "It was super cool to get my first podium in the World Cup," said Burghardt, "I'm super happy that Mariama is with me. I'm super happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," she said, emphasizing: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot of work around it." Jamanka was a bit frustrated with the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's moving in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I could buy it now! What should I do?
I have not received it and therefore could not pay for it, which is why I finally asked. Due to Corona, I had other problems last year and never had the time for it. And now it was said to be expired, which made me very angry. Look in the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again, as it is currently reduced.
Therefore, the shipping will only start on March 16th? There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Yesterday, it was taken from you by your colleague. Why is that a problem today? I also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we still want the shelf module, even a new undamaged one, and not the entire order canceled.
Only today, only this week, only until XY... Hello lovely girls and women, I have something I simply have to write and maybe it will help the one or the other as well... I am 24, have kPTBS, a full-time student, and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he is basically one-to-one my child. My friend (together since 6J) is sick, has a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice. I helped him with the shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to the burn). He is also cold and we see each other less often (1-2 times a week) which is causing me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love. My dog child has just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cuddle blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and stroking him. I live alone with my sister and mother, and my mother is away for a month now. Now comes the housework on us, which we naturally divide between us. But even cooking is a lot of work for me... My PTBS disease is currently well-established, I am almost good therapized and come straight. Not good, but I come straight and am almost symptom-free. My university is demanding a lot of me (for me) right now, I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm that I haven't prepared for and on Wednesday I have an anatomy lesson that I at least have to prepare a bit for. And next week, I have a oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left. So my week looks like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then what? Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the vacation. Only until the weekend. Only until... And so it goes on endlessly. I believe I am just so stressed that I need these mental anchors because otherwise I can't keep up. Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do anything about it... Do you also feel like this? Honestly, I am unbelievably grateful that I don't have to work. Really unbelievably grateful, I can't even express it in words. I don't know if I would have survived my kPTBS otherwise. I think that has partly to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here... I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I have received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color and surface is scratched and the table leg has an impression. With the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website. We are very disappointed!!!! What can you offer me? If I exchange the table now, will I get another color or how?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12#NUMBER#. However, it was not confirmed twice.
Mal was komplett anderes: I discovered in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography. For me, it was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed. How do you feel about that? Maybe you can also tell me about colleagues from work or studies with different attitudes. Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it's reasonable to separate them. It also gives you a curriculum, etc. But wouldn't it be just strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity? What motivates someone to teach religion if they don't believe in it? Preserving culture or something like that? I hope your question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English as I understand it well. This has been a long time, so I would prefer to avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Hello dear people,  I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24 years old). I believe it was a movie for young people. In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, there is modernity (the real world). On the other hand, there is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it any better, there is a young woman in the real world. And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those in Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a story develops. The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman there so that he can continue to live, as I understand it. I believe the transition is also the gravesite of the soldier. In the end, both soldiers fight against each other. If this gives you any clue, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on their stomach from week 1. Fast forward: they're still alive:D Relax. A child is more fun than one might think. Make sure everything around them is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and check often, but no constant monitoring. That would drive you crazy! Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows. Oh, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket. Observe your child when they sleep. Does it turn its head to the side? Can it sit up from the stomach? Or is it lying face-first directly on the mattress? You can tell from that whether everything is in order. We've all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common to put kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "Stammkunde" (regular customer) with you and have already bought many articles, but why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback yet. It is about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit in the wardrobe. I kindly request that you contact me as soon as possible. The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To be quite clear. RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV. Only it's simply the case that the politics of this station has become utterly unpopular. Nearly every format is sponsored (okay), but then they still go on a begging tour. It was said that one wanted to be an "independent" internet station. Quote Arno: One wanted to "not be a running advertising column". What are we now? An 0815 commercial broadcaster who tries to sell his merchandise to the elite fans. And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne. They can of course continue to insult people. A man who lacks empathy tries to make a mess of things on behalf of the action with the exploded rented rooms. How can all of this be reconciled? Great if it's your thing, I find it terrible.
Please provide a callback, as my delivered wooden table is defective and has a broken corpus due to the damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
If you need a comforting cuddle buddy or simply for snuggling - my little warm friend is versatilely usable. Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for pleasant warmth applications, as cherry pits absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled manner. The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven. The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well. The cherry pit pillow with cover is exclusively intended for the following application areas: Check for untypical odor, stains or branding before heating the pillow and dispose of it immediately if present! Please remove the inner pillow from the cover before heating in the microwave! Heat the pillow in the microwave at max. 300 Watt for max. 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions!). After heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it! Then put the inner pillow back in the cover. At the beginning, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this will disappear with repeated applications. Always follow the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can lead to damage (fire and burn risk!). Check before microwaving the pillow that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions. After the heated inner pillow has been put back in the cover, please check the pillow's temperature on suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) on your arm! Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bleeding, and open wounds, as well as for persons with reduced pain sensitivity. In case of existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes, or tumor diseases and pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use. If seams open and cherry pits come out, dispose of the product and the loose pits immediately and inaccessible for children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year, the baby's temperature should be regularly controlled during application to exclude overheating! All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority of the state in which the user is domiciled. The cover is removable and machine-washable at 30 °C. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after the second round - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone. For Ingolstadt, it's also not going well under the third coach. Celebration in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead? Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) wouldn't charge when I plugged it in. I bought the charger about 5 months ago, so it should still work. I thought the charger was enough to power the laptop. Error message says the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the charger plugged in. So I disassembled the battery, but nothing happened. Do you have any ideas? I've ordered a new battery, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation? Is there something else broken? Many thanks for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of #PRS\_ORG# brought into the room. How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat height is...
Translation:  Are you often on the go and still carrying a lot of equipment? With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, there's no problem! With a capacity of 20 liters, it can easily accommodate larger photo equipment without any issues, thanks to the padded FlexFold dividers that securely store them. And whatever everyday items you need, they will remain well-organized and separate from the photo equipment, thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior. With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design is famous for it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment. This works with two options: once conventionally through the flap closure, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags. The closure flap has a metal locking hook with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has also taken different "fill levels" into account: there are 4 anchor bars, securely riveted, into which the locking hook can be inserted. If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the upper bar, is it emptier, a lower one. The closure flap and hook are also magnetically attached. So the backpack can be reliably closed without having to grasp the hook. The second option also fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: in addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to rummage through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday suitability of the backpack: when you're not only carrying photo equipment but also everyday items or travel gear, you can configure the interior of the backpack individually (more on that below) and thus easily separate the two - and access them independently through the two side openings. This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while everyday items remain safely on the left side and don't get in the way. Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with that. And since the backpack's outer shell is completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even on a trip to Scotland in autumn.
Unfortunately, I was waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# announced to me yesterday that they had sent an email confirming the assignment of the contact person for the shipping company to pick up the wrongly delivered table. So far, I have not received any message. I kindly request immediate processing. I am already writing to the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I would receive an email confirmation. It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#.
It is unacceptable to keep the cabinet without knowing when it will be delivered. Keeping it is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. Have a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture and not sent it back. And I couldn't have anticipated that the past year turned out differently and couldn't properly settle and clear it. But as a customer, I can't accept the damage.

The thus produced machined discs ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness. Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, where the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads. Aesthetic properties of our machined discs underline the attractive and striking appearance of each car, emphasizing the character of each vehicle.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country. Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels appeared almost overnight. Everyone wanted a piece of the country's wealth. For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself. You will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and building companies. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding riverbeds and adjacent areas. You are not alone - other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must outdo your fellow pioneers to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them. Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win. You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works for you (known as "engine building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor. With these buildings and the dynamic tile plates, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments. Coloma plays over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year California achieved official statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds. During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then, their selection is revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock! This deactivates the one half of the location - reducing the possible actions there. Then, the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return. The auctioneer turns at the beginning of each round to a new location, changing the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, meaning that each location has been covered once and the year ends. There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from a gang of angry bandits in a pre-emptive attack. If the players contribute enough gunfighters and have a significant numerical advantage over the bandits, they receive rewards. If they fail, they receive smaller rewards or end up on the cemetery. The game ends after the third shootout, and the final scoring takes place. The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I take items up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm in size. The shipping method is usually DPD, with shipping verification (games included, wrapped in paper and packed in cardboard). If you are a collector, I can also send items in their original packaging for an additional fee of 2 euros, which guarantees 100% no dents.
Why Children Are Not Tyrants Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately. >The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on child-rearing. Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him. Please be careful, the film is difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. It must never, never be up to parents and other responsible adults to have power over a child. Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to create a framework for the child that is as large as it is reasonable and possible in the given situation. Brrr, it still shakes me up.
Holetschek: Countries discuss removal of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide removal of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting. "We countries need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing requirement can be lifted for triple-vaccinated individuals," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag". The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive," said Holetschek. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to "present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference already on Tuesday," according to - AFP.
I also want to send the lamp back. How should I proceed best?
Hello, I really like the #PRS\_ORG# chair, but I can't see how high the seat height is. Can you help me further?
I can't complete any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG# account. Error message: Oops, an error has occurred. Shopping through the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer works. I have updated my account details. What could be the cause of this?
As you describe it, it is referred to as *Awareness*, which are sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000. The most common is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images, and the rarest is the perception of pain. For this topic, relevant: Cesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until delivery to protect the child. Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia methods, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), go with a slightly increased risk. **EDIT: Dear all, although my comment describes Awareness correctly, u/Nitemarex did not have one by definition. I must have misread their comment.**
However, the chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20 euros also do not help us. These are statutory warranty claims. At the very least, they should take back the defective chair. This is not only a legal obligation, but also a standard in eCommerce. Please check again whether they will at least take back the defective chair. We will then sell the second chair privately. This will also cost us a lot of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to. Again, the question. In the order and on the invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The shipping company is Company #NAME#. I just called them. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS\_ORG#. Is that really the case? If so, I will have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor. Will I not be contacted? I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He became known as a theater critic and later as an intendant. Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97. There is still a new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older". It is a shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021. And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my gratitude for life."
There are different types of palettes. One of the most common ones are European palettes, standardized wooden palettes that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL. In 2020, according to data from the Austrian Statistical Office, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria. The production value was around 79 million euros. The number of palettes imported to Austria annually is not recorded.

Rolled Meat Tips & Tricks I received some great tips for the perfect goulash last week. It was served at Christmas and was incredibly delicious and buttery! Thank you again for that :) Now I've come to the taste and I want to cook rolled meat for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I will set a beef broth. Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.  Translation:  Rolled Meat Tips & Tricks I received some great tips for the perfect goulash last week.

How is everything going? What about the books? How can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'll manage.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made. However, the money has not yet been received. Could you please check on this?
For many people, goose or duck is associated with Christmas as much as the Christmas tree and gifts. Have you not yet purchased poultry for the holiday season? Now is the time to act. We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can set the desired level and gain on the one hand and adjust the distortion on the other hand. Furthermore, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the gain and distortion. As mentioned earlier, you can even create a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it gets too loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation. The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings. An AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam along to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuner. If you buy the VFS5 foot switch, you can also comfortably call up sounds, switch effects on and off, and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects "tap" with your foot. This is essential for live use. With its new power packs, VOX takes another step into the future!
However, I have seen it differently. Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back? Since it is too low hanging for a dining table? Then I would like to send it back. Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe? Can we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a remainder or voucher. Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture. I don't need more than 1,000 euros worth of items that I don't need.
I have just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# Spiegel (door) mirror on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory response, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status at your company?
Iran sees progress in talks on nuclear agreement According to Iranian statements, progress is being made in the talks on the revival of the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency IRNA. This is a "positive and important development," as at the beginning there was no agreement on the issues to be negotiated. The agreement is supposed to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks on the revival of the agreement have been continued after a break of almost a week. The negotiations are attended by negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia, as well as a US delegation. However, the US delegation is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence. Thuringia has surpassed Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country. As the only federal state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had the highest Corona incidence on Sunday with a value over 1000. The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence in the country, this value was 990.5 on Sunday. On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but still exceeded the value of 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within a day. 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday. On weekends, there may be reporting delays. Additionally, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the detection of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, is that it or not? Here, I don't have to click/enter/fill anything else, right?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to kindly request that the return shipping be paid by the sender. An 8 euro return shipping fee, in my opinion, is audacious.
It's time for changes ====================  Welcome to the meeting, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day! =============================================================================================================  What's the purpose of this post? If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, you can conclude that it is non-existent. We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer gap for several months. ========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste. For this reason, I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I have put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope it will be returned and I will have a full refund. This is also very sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have a question: does the daily schedule #PRS\_ORG# also come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
PRS\_ORG must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly. Please arrange this now. I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for collection - they must clarify with PRS\_ORG how this can work. PRS\_ORG can always contact me by phone to arrange a collection date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time would I need to assemble it or decide on returning it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? Today, I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like very much. She herself has lived vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely. I myself was a vegetarian for several years before. When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And the answer was that I had long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but I eventually realized that I was supporting animal suffering with it. Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction arose on her side, and she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian one could reduce animal suffering. Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"? How do you answer the question? I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without wanting it. Greetings from a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is not a unique exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am the assigned date on which #PRS\_ORG# is supposed to collect my return not in person. Unfortunately, due to a funeral, I cannot be present in person and this cannot be changed either. Please assign me an alternative pickup date. From February 1st #NUMBER#, I will be consistently available again.
The Lahnstein defense for water rescue is prepared: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a subsidy decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new equipment vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein at Lahnstein City Hall to Mayor Peter Labonte. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in security. I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Lahnstein's Mayor Peter Labonte. The equipment vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate. They perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance both on and under water. In Lahnstein, it is assumed that there will be increasing deployments: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I have bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I have followed their recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work. I am a bit frustrated because this whole process has already cost me a lot of time, and I hope now for help.
Okay, so it is. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June. Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to this whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar job, i.e. as a weapon carrier in the executive, furthermore, I do not want to go into that either! The question of right and left always seems to me to be oversimplified. However, generally speaking, one should say that of course the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone. Of course, it is also clear that people with a conservative mindset are naturally attracted to the uniform and weapon carriers, but it is also clear that these people have difficulty dealing with everyday reality, especially since there are now not only average white people, but also many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you). And also on these groups, I have to rely, because in the end, they may save your life or set it up for you. But these marginalized groups also represent, according to my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel themselves less affected by overly left-wing politics, even though these policies are supposedly meant to help them, but they just want to be treated normally. Back to the right, since of course the police and the armed forces are a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, but it is medially exaggerated that they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly plan any state-endangering plans. Of course, it also happens that police officers and soldiers, who often served abroad, start to generalize and also say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. But it also happens that right-wing sympathizers definitely meet and engage in lively discussion. Nevertheless, such things are fought against and countered with political education and enlightenment! In my opinion, it is good that such things are combated and countered with political education and enlightenment! Germany is so internationally entangled that it is also good in my opinion that we cannot have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, if there's something I don't understand, I've also ordered the other basket from the German side. Why should it come from England? When I ordered, it wasn't sold out. I ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available. I previously chatted with #NAME#. Alternatively, could you deliver the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany? I always find only you as a partner company.
However, there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part that are filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch.
Ordinary with children? Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a matter for a longer time. I am very disciplined and organized at work (self-employed, very little free time), but throughout my life, I have always had trouble maintaining a clean and orderly household permanently. There are always phases in which everything stays lying around, and then every now and then, it catches me, and I tidy up and clean. But it's never really like "someone could drop by spontaneously." My husband (unfortunately) is also not better. It bothers me somewhere, but mostly, the household just loses against work and laziness. The kitchen is still cleaned the most regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become orderly with children? We haven't had any yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been bothering me for a longer time. Because for me, I don't have an incentive, it doesn't bother me as much as long as no one comes and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable. Do you have a greater incentive with children or do you remain slovenly? I'm looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-end anatomically pre-formed cut offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and enables almost unrestricted freedom of movement. Pre-formed with special, further pressing at the joints for improved joint mobility (arm- and knee bending) The Focea Comfort 4 was developed for the Flex System 2, where the covered area by the Flex System was more than doubled to further increase comfort. Nose-less stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm- and knee bending) High-quality pre-formings in the lower back area and in the step ensure a close-fitting, perfect sitting. Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back closure and thus improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment on the surface. The Free Flex Zone around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection. Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body. Nose-less, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face on the hood increases comfort, the sealing and durability (separate head hood) Soft, chest-located zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the masking or stitching Doppelmanschetten with zipper at arm- and foot joints connect a turnable inner sleeve with a soft, covered neoprene outer sleeve 45° recess at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and durability when pulling on. Long zipper at the neck with Elaskin reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort without a hood Long G-Lock back zipper (without hood) with metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent) Zippers at arms and legs Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlapping for greater durability Edges of the outer sleeves trimmed for increased flexibility Edges of the inner sleeves recessed for increased flexibility The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, specifically for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common armband-computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-unconfident personality disorder? I have completed an education in software development and have been out of school for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right fit for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting over and studying social work. The problem: I have a self-unconfident (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS). This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-worth and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for me to engage in casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as aloof (which I think I have already improved upon). Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support. I know it's difficult to find out what the actual workday is like, but it's hard to find information online. My ÄVPS is already causing problems in my current job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("just another simple thing messed up") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do this by now"/"he's holding me back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.). These problems will probably be present in any job, but I wanted to mention them here.
But have you already held onto the sofa? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup. Please let me know what they want me to return!
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, does the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book is there a problem?" appear?
I was chatting with #PRS\_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein contained in the feed (Protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these, the bird builds its own protein components, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the bird's overall organism. Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can otherwise disrupt the breeding process. After the brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed.

It is recommended to prepare only as much water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily. A teaspoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In case of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regeneration is visible. Then the normal dose is administered until feather regeneration is complete. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C, and stored.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break down after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged upon arrival and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws  Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have a problem. A walnut tree on our property needs to be felled. So, a felling application has been submitted to the community. An employee writes me that the felling of fruit trees and thus also the walnut tree is not part of the bylaws. However, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaws. Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not? On the one hand, I must be able to rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the bylaws are unambiguous. Thank you for your answers.
As we understand it, then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message. Okay, then I still have a sofo without use. Could you offer me a surplus or a coupon? What were they more expensive?
Yes, I can help you translate the document from German to English. Here's the translation:  ja, das glaube ich, nur die Frage ist ja, ob ich in Euro bezahlen und mir die Decke nach Deutschland liefern lassen kann Können Sie das prüfen?  Yes, I think so, the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the deed delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Notification: Serious traffic accident in Selb A serious traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the exit Selb-North and Plößberg. According to the press alert of the police, which is currently being circulated (14:03 hours), a car was overtaking in the opposite direction. There are injured persons.
Okay, I understand. Thank you very much that it went so smoothly!
Merry Christmas to you all! Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good this year because my dear head is currently busy thinking about everything that can be thought. Before I go on ... briefly: I need advice and, ideally, from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you. I am currently in the process of switching careers. Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (I won't mention anything more specific), but it was too boring for me. I then looked for alternatives that could bring me more fun. At some point, I ended up at the teaching profession and was sure that was it - even though the working conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me. I am now at the point where I am constantly googling other job advertisements. It's been half a year now. In the previous cases, I always decided to continue and at least finish the refresher course. After that, I could always switch again. But now I am absolutely exhausted. I have had so little free time in the last month that I am completely drained. Now there is still vacation, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me. Before the refresher course, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but now my weekend was also my day off and my vacation time was my vacation time. I had free time. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now the family celebration is too much stress for me. And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more. Overall, it's fun and the refresher course is going well in terms of feedback, but I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it shuts down completely - if it hasn't already. I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life be like this - especially when I read some of your contributions - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had free time when I needed it, and worked together as a team, rather than being a lone fighter like I do most of the time now. But then I wonder if I wouldn't be back in the same place a year from now, unfulfilled. You can see that it's all a bit messy, but perhaps you have some advice or ideas as outsiders that could help me get out of this situation where I am completely exhausted and start crying at the thought of making any decisions, which probably wouldn't lead to anything good. I won't make any decisions emotionally right now, that's probably not a good idea. But perhaps your perspectives could help me at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and excuse the weepy tone from me. I hope my situation has at least become a bit clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amplifiers, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which partly relies on genuine analog circuits because these better capture the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow. With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists searching for maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the compression and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite Wagner's 20 points: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure parts, it adapts entirely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens. A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash unit. Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses. In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items. Even drone pilots find an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history? In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused great damage. Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island. So far, the eruption of the Volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. No reliable data are available on earlier eruptions. The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make a forecast as to when it could end. The indicators point to a slowdown. The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, President of the Island Council, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE. Damages in millions of euros In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, almost 2,900 residential buildings and other structures have been destroyed by the more than 1,000 degree Celsius hot lava, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava. This corresponds to almost 1,700 football fields. More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at over 900 million euros. Through cooled lava, two new coastal areas with an area of about 50 hectares were created off the coast. The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend, was particularly affected. 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, as reported by the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts are at the door, and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have something seductive in themselves, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension. Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss is a "society-binding contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition. As for Nicholas becoming the Christ Child, it was the Protestants who made it strict, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked to the act of giving. Before that, gifts were given on St. Nicholas' Day in one way or another. The background to this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin. From this unconventional form of giving emerged the popular custom in Germany of filling children's boots with gifts. Protestants reject this custom because they see it as a "holy veneration." For this reason, they resist the institution. Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition line. The focus of giving shifted to the Holy Evening. Since most Protestants no longer see such details so closely, it only annoys a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is similar to the Martin custom with Martin singing and the Martin procession, which is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas time. Today, one finds everything from socks to coveted luxury watches at the door and under the Christmas tree. The variety of traditions in Christian countries proves a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas' Day. With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to the Holy Evening. In all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful confusion about the question of who brings the gifts to the children. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on the Holy Evening or the Christmas Man, who in principle is a kind of Nicholas, but has over time acquired some peculiarities, such as his white fluffy beard, which has little in common with the somewhat stern Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Hag Befana who is said to have shown the way to the Jesus child. In Scandinavia, sometimes fairy beings bring the gifts, while in Russia it is Father Frost who has achieved some fame. Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh. In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace In London, near the Kensington Palace, a man armed with a weapon was shot by the police on Saturday. The police reported that callers had reported a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookkeeper's business. The man fled according to police statements in a vehicle, which was stopped by officers a short time later. Shots were fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene. The police did not assume a terrorist background. In the area around the Kensington Palace, several embassies are located. The palace is the official residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.

Pill Problem Hello dear ladies and gentlemen,  I hope I'm doing everything right here. After a year, it's actually my first post. To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pain during my period and PMS before my period. Now I would like to stay away from it again because I already have to take enough medication due to my chronic illnesses that I can't choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin. I suddenly got explosive pickles from a score of 0 to 100 during my two-year break and they were everywhere. As superficial as it may sound, it really bothered me and I didn't feel well. During my two-year break, my skin never really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time. My cosmetics are already parfum-free and without drama, but maybe someone can recommend something to me. The gynecologist didn't take me seriously and I still have to make an appointment with a dermatologist. Thank you to everyone who read the book! Yes, the dear skin is such a thing. I had severe premenstrual dysphoric disorder, then a period of rest, then widespread cystic acne, and the acne topic. I have also tried everything in terms of nutrition during my chronic illness and have been on a sugar, milk, and meat-free mixed diet because nothing else really worked. It could also be that hormonally there is just a worm in there, but if you want to have a construction site everywhere, you'd rather not look for anything else that might be wrong.
I had already written everything to my colleague's seminar o. ä. and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern. I have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...

In the name of the people: Laypeople hand down judgments. In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench. But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Jurors decide with professional judges how long someone will be behind bars. Two of them, Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach, report in an interview with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: They are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht an der John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.

Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have the option to store it for so long. We would use the table as if it were offered to us, as if it were ours.
Sure, here's the translation:  "Already in November of the same year, I had ordered a blue one and received it. Therefore, I would like to have a gray one now because they are so beautiful."

10-kV earth cable will be newly built in 2022 The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid. The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria makes the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk today. The around seven kilometer long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be attached to a pole of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in parts with us. The blue betsell number: #PRS\_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me how the further process is now? Have a great start to the week!
You can forget about that, I have already explained it several times yesterday! It is a glass commode, and all sides are covered with glass, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken. The commode is in my apartment, and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS\_ORG# regulations. This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request is made at #PRS\_ORG# since it probably involves a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues,  I have been at the Ref since summer and teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems with time-efficiently planning my geography lessons. Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the schoolbook, and an OHP as media. In school, I can also only print in black and white for free (which is annoying for geography). I simply need a lot of time to plan my lessons. For example, we are currently doing the topic of geofactors, and for me, each hour stands on its own. Basically, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lesson hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I always plan from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We are currently using the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied. Therefore, the worksheets. Maybe someone can tell me how to work time-efficiently with the book. I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. Although I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for Christmas business. In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered can enter. The trade considers this unnecessary and complains of sales losses. A possible solution is also ready. According to the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas business for the retail trade. With non-daily consumer goods stores, sales losses should be expected, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth. According to a current HDE survey of 1,100 retailers, more than 70 percent of the companies look negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many have already written off the Christmas business. "What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a hole without a bottom," said Genth. Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost in the past week almost a third of their pre-crisis sales. Only the food retail trade and the online trade are doing well. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development. Shopping with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director. "2G in shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations deter customers and require high personnel costs. The bandage regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded. Then, each customer would only have to prove 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all stores with the received bandage on that day. In addition, in the retail trade - as in the public transport sector with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random sample checks should be sufficient. Even the specialized real estate company for shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last week without 2G at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, and the sales at about 90 percent. These numbers will now fall in the so important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approvals will be obtained for the centers. This includes the so-called bandage solution, where "the visitors, for example, once at a central location in the center present their 2G proof and then - equipped with a wristband similar to that in a hotel - can freely visit all stores". dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS\_ORG# and received it. The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error on the frame that was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler. That looks unsightly. I would like to return the mirror and have already re-packed it and sealed it. How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance construction, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color rendering. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary possibilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp. In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K and save it. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate. The lamp produces a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The 120-degree radiation angle allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance. By the way, it is also suitable for reporters in small rooms or short distances. You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool for working both on the film set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in television studios or when the lamp is mounted in difficult-to-access places. On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a backlit display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin. There is also a slot for NP-F batteries (not included) on the back of the lamp. The user memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To execute the settings of individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons. The memory controller saves the current status of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures. Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. This is due to the ability to operate the device with inexpensive NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also be checked before the set to see if the batteries have sufficient capacity - it has a built-in battery tester for each of the two battery compartments - a value is displayed in the two display indicators (the upper display for the left battery, the lower display for the right battery). In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the lamp with power through the included power supply. The construction of the lamp is very simple. You have a 16mm thread for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your photography tripod. The tilt is securely adjustable via locking screws on both sides. It has been ensured that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore also designed for durability and hard use. Additionally, a tilting joint is included in the delivery. Great is that a bag is included in the delivery. So you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to purchase without any problems.
Sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
The party that we wanted to throw: Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt. After 22 minutes, the last two-time champions in a row seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga relegation. But then the SGE turned around, shot off their frustration over a mediocre start to the season within an hour and won wildly with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have accomplished today," coach Oliver Glasner shouted at DAZN and gave a "blanket compliment to everyone who was there," adding that it initially looked like another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which was still in ninth place despite their expectations. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead with 2:0. What happened next impressed even the SGE coach. "How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued. I'm crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result. Even defensive player Christopher Lenz, who could finally play again after four games and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was particularly pleased with the result for the fans. That was the party we wanted to throw. But for the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself and sees himself well prepared in terms of personnel. It's extraordinary that we have all players fit in December and that all players are physically in top form. It's top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally. Now we want to "step by step" and "stay humble" and run the tasks until the end of the year "at this level." As next, already on Wednesday in the course of the English week, an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (5:30 p.m., Sky) is on the program.
I received the email that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my side. I tried to have it redirected at #PRS\_ORG#, but there was no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again, or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is resubmitted? Unfortunately, that would mean that I wouldn't order again, as it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Muffler for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain Germany's handball women slipped after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks from the pitch. At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a harsh defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," coach Henk Groener judged. Against Spain, we must act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished third in group III with 8:2 points behind Denmark (10:0) in the main round. It's a shame that we couldn't bring the flow with us. That was a bad game that we have to erase," said captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for qualification for the semi-finals on Monday, against the 2019 World Cup runner-up, a clear improvement is necessary to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive. The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was wing player Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," back player Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We must now quickly look ahead." Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at their best at the start of the match. Misses and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the ball and prevented worse with some parades. The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack. However, this was not the desired ignition. Against the aggressive Danish defense, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Danish goal. The game was over early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, as back player Mia Zschocke was sent off due to a hard foul on her opponent and received a red card. However, she will be able to participate in the quarterfinals again. Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection start to play better and at least reached five goals by the break. The already faint hope of a comeback after the substitution was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19. Again, the Groener protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders at the end of the tournament, to win. In the end, the German team could not muster any more performance and left the pitch as clear losers.

The title is given, I am a mobile pharmacist working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these are almost complete, it goes on to part of the vaccination centers for me. I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination..."). In my area of responsibility is the education for vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me so far). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants. In vaccination teams, we often don't have pharmacists but pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who can't administer the vaccinations (can they?), so I also perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Helper" Question: Amberg knows the solution What is a "Helper"? With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, there has been ensured hefty thinking in the BR television show "We in Bavaria". However, unlike many previous days, the term was not guessed by the callers in the series "Host mi?". No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And neither was it "someone who has to get everything done quickly". That, listeners heard from the TV moderator, was completely wrong. Whereupon the man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus probably also surprised many Upper Palatinate residents. "The Helper", the audience learned, "is a cloth used to wipe the stove". Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian Television as an expert for years, confirmed this. With the comment that this is a typical Upper Palatinate word, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern". With which a gap in education has been closed - perhaps also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.

Is tire choice when cycling really as safe as advertised? This morning, I woke up full of determination because I wanted to at least train a little for my upcoming cycling tour next week. Well, I got started and I rode my new racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday. The first 40km were great - but then what happened, which always lurks in every city center (this time: Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the road. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to participate in the rest of the ride. Since I didn't have a real opportunity due to the weekday, I couldn't get a replacement tube and tube, so I had to turn around with a half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't as bad as technically, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the cycling tour. Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would very much like to avoid this problem again and again. Now it wasn't so bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who rode 140km on the day I picked up the bike until 2:12pm!) and he also described them as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for several years. But when I think about having to change the tire after 80-90km of riding, I'm afraid I'm not in a good mood:D Now, I've had a conversation with an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbreakable. It sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible? I don't want to spend 40€/tire now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike. That's apparently also available with Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are wider. Is this a problem? Or would you advise me to a different tire for a racing bike in general? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! I have little knowledge in this area, so I'm more inclined to recommend the Durano DD. Thank you in advance for the help and warm greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and collided with a central island. He then drove onto the opposite lane and was involved in a frontal collision with a 27-year-old's vehicle. The car of the 53-year-old was then thrown against a tree, and the man in the car was crushed. The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were severely injured and taken to nearby hospitals.

Hello everyone,  finally we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST this year! Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement. BUT: At least three people will be present per switch, so we will broadcast the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you will follow us! We will do our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - we will still do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible. It will start around 0:30. Get your drinks cold, plan good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
