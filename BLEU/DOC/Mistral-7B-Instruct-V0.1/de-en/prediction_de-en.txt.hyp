The cost of the product is less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the value of the product. I am a large customer, so it's not a problem for me. All I need is a number or instructions on how to return the package so that it can be tracked by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I find that very frustrating. Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it at a better price or is there another option for a refund?
I generally believe that it is not fair to ask children to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings. However, I think it is good for older siblings to help take care of the younger ones in moderation. They can take turns watching, helping, bringing drinks, etc. This teaches them responsibility, helps them contribute to the family, and makes them feel connected. As long as they are still young enough to be children themselves, I don't see any problems. If your K1 is comfortable being alone for a short time and it works for them, then that's fine. You know your children best, so it's up to you to decide what works for them. It's not fair to ask K1 to take care of K2 for too long, especially if something unexpected happens like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc. That would be too much responsibility for K1 to handle. Whether this is a risk you are willing to take is up to you.
Help me please find the title of the book again! I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but I can't seem to remember the title. Maybe someone here knows it... The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going into the enclosure with his cats. The case is taken over by a detective who, after a short investigation, discovers that the zookeeper was being treated by a therapist who ran a clinic where he treated patients with fear. The detective has a niece who also suffers from fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist's clinic. More suicides occur, and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to document each suicide scene and post the photos online. It turns out that this therapist was running an underground therapy group where patients had a chip implanted in their heads that suppressed an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately ended up killing themselves in the most extreme way possible. (A woman jumps out of a window, another drives herself intentionally to death) This act of facing fear is referred to as "the fight" in the book. At the end, there is a big showdown at the therapist's clinic, which was involved in a fire. That's the basic plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author / author. If anyone knows the title of the book or can give me a hint, I would be very grateful.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi. I need to contact my husband first. But that might take some time. What should I do next?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
Dear, 4 years old, Splitter under the thumbnail, four years old, has a wooden splinter under the thumbnail (outside). They tried to pull it out with a tweezers. It was very difficult to grab.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and sound module on a single circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, allowing it to be installed in almost any locomotive on H0 and 0 gauge tracks. LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker, along with a sound module building kit. Like all family members, the LokSound 5 is a true multiprotocol decoder. It supports the DCC data format as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In the DCC format, there are 14 to 128 speed steps, as well as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions. Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically connect to a suitable digital central unit. It supports all DCC programming modes and, with the help of compatible central units, the CV values can be read from the main track. For central units that can only program CVs from 1 to 255, there are help registers available. Motorola® users can achieve up to 28 speed steps with 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola® addresses allow the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the Control Unit 6021. The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration on mfx®-compatible central units. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® brake segments, ZIMO® HLU brake commands, or the Lenz® ABC system. Braking with DCC brake modules or with DC power is also possible. In addition, it holds the Selectrix® brake diode in place. An ABC pendulum train control system enables automatic switching between two stations. The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC tracks.

Due to Omicron: Johnson will accelerate booster shots in the UK. New Omicron cases will be provided by politics and science in the UK. By New Year's Eve, all eligible adults in England should receive an impunity offer. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will accelerate booster shots in the Corona-Auffrischungsimpfungen in the face of rapidly increasing Omicron cases, as previously planned. Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, as long as at least three months have passed since the second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his constituents on Sunday evening. The target date was previously set for the end of January. The British government will also provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing an emergency due to the Omicron variant, so it is necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, Johnson said. The good news is that the protection level can be increased with a third dose. "Get boosted now!", Johnson said. On Sunday, 1239 new Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137. This was an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. dpa

I am for the idea that everyone presents themselves with pronouns. I have sent out a job application. Today I received an invitation to a conversation via email. I want to respond to the email. However, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on where they/he have a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman. **I have no idea how I should write the email now. Can someone please help me? ** I am an outsider and do not want to step on any toes. Conclusion: everyone should present themselves with pronouns.

It seems that the chair had an invisible defect in sales. How can such a damage to the upholstery occur after 9 months?
I have been trying to read books on the #PRS_ORG# platform, but it has not been working for about 14 days. As a result, I have been purchasing the last books through the website and then reading them on the #PRS_ORG# platform.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were none left. Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and have you bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content-Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence. I must simply write something about the soul. I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons. A theme that bothers me a lot and happens too often is that many victims don't want to be helped or think we can't help them. I know that we can't do everything and it's not perfect. But there are things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in those situations. I see the bruises, the blood, the terrified eyes... But even in conversation with four people, with the perpetrator out of sight and hearing range, I can't reach everyone. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes very close to tears, is that it's worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence. Often I wish I could help in every situation... I know I can't. It gets easier that way, but it never does. Please, always remember that it's worth living without violence, that's so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking setup: "Arcane", the series set in the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently started on Netflix. Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel der MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg bei den Merlins Crailsheim  At least one player was missing for the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg in their derby game against the Merlins Crailsheim. Again, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with reference to the Pokal-Niederlage against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim in early October: "We still have some anger in our stomachs." However, this anger did not dissipate after the game - on the contrary, it increased even further in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) -loss in the Basketball-Bundesliga. In addition to the bare result, the manner of appearance was also disappointing. To illustrate this, a statistic can be cited, which expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13%, with four hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? The answer came from John Patrick: "We were not concentrated enough after the win in Teneriffa and did not manage to implement what we had trained." Namely, to move the ball. On the other hand, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: "A great game to win against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 spectators." However, only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, but they made up for it with their enthusiasm. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team. "The best playmaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim. In contrast, the players in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed on the entire line. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen prevent a total debacle and come within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind. In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points. Fortunately, there is still a lot of time left for hadering. Already on Wednesday (9 pm) the Riesen receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, before then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had an earlier email address, but I changed it.

Max Raabe turns 59 today, but his birthday celebration in Leipzig has been postponed until May 2022 due to coronavirus restrictions. The singer, who was born in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, has been singing since he was young and studied opera in Berlin. He founded the Palast Orchester in 1986 and has since established himself as a baritone known for his repertoire of Schlagers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series reached the second spot on the charts in 2019, and his album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) was also a success. Max Raabe is known for his elegant style, with his blonde hair carefully groomed and his outfits carefully planned. He has been touring with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" since 2020. dpa

Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: No New Housing Through Expropriation The new Federal Minister for Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been proposed in a referendum in Berlin. "With expropriation, no new housing units are created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to ensure that tenants have security, so that their rent remains affordable in the next few years. A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is actually the best protection against monopolization. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission to determine how to proceed with the result of the referendum. If the situation does not improve, Geywitz has indicated that she is willing to hold talks with the FDP in the coalition government about further strengthening rent laws. The coalition agreement includes a rent brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index. I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible. If the housing market does not improve, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 deaths through tornados in Kentucky During a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been drawn through the USA. In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported. The images from there remind of a war zone. On the night of Saturday, several tornados caused severe damage in the USA and may have resulted in up to 100 fatalities. The storms left a approximately 320 kilometer long trail of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky. Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky, after visiting the disaster area, stated that everywhere the tornado had passed, everything was gone. Homes, shops, government buildings - everything was just gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is difficult to imagine that this is actually possible. He alone in the state of Kentucky expects up to 100 deaths, the official numbers are increasing continuously.

Companies pay vaccination incentives and change advertising slogans While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination incentive, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees financial incentives for vaccination. This aligns them with the Social Partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today are calling for financial incentives for vaccination. Additionally, the restructuring of advertising slogans to vaccination calls - in the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to Corona-vaccinations.
He has switched to a company where he was interviewed. That doesn't improve his situation any better than yours. Waiting and drinking tea. It's been a year. He obviously didn't stick to his old job and found something else. You can do that too. And that he didn't find you good then: well, who cares. He found his job bad too. There are too many variables.
Please stop the cancellation. This will then be legally relevant. I am taking a screen shot.

Help with the first campaign of Boron! I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure over the Greifenpass and want to seamlessly transition them into a campaign that I have written specifically for the players. We are playing DSA 5. The big picture is set, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are planned, and now I am in the process of writing the introductory adventure. However, I am already stumbling over my own feet with the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes are tasked with bringing a cart filled with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-See. From there, the story will develop. A few miles away from the village, a group of Goblins will ambush the heroes and lure them into a trap. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: through persuasion, action, threat, or recognizing the danger early on. Group strength: 8 regular Goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords. If the heroes are not paying attention, the Goblins will ambush them in a hollow way and flank them with bows on both sides while two with spears stop the cart. If a fight breaks out and the heroes lose, I have two possible solutions: 1. The heroes are all knocked unconscious and are later found and healed by the son of the village schoolteacher, a half-elf. The cart is of course gone. 2. If a defeat is unavoidable, the son of the village schoolteacher, a half-elf, will come to the heroes' aid in the fight. The cart is still there, everything is great. What do you think of solution 2? Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure? The group of Goblins will later play a significant role in the story, so they are not just cannon fodder.

Here was the lower part, which was essentially the part with the storage space damaged. Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space part?
I am tired of Sky Sport F1  Hello F1 fans,  Over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has been declining, so I wanted to take a moment to express my frustration with this. Today, during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show. Although the start was delayed and there was an accident, it would have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision as well. It seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, leaving Sky DE with no choice. However, this is still frustrating, especially since Sky UK is broadcasting the race to the end.  There is one positive aspect: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job handling the difficult situation surrounding the accident. However, there were some mistakes by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher. They did not know that under a red flag, the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, it was only when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton that they realized that Verstappen could change his tires. At Sky UK and RTL, the commentators knew immediately that this was possible.  In my opinion, such basic rules should be known when commenting on F1 for a pay-TV channel. It is also not the first time that it has been necessary to guess what is allowed or required by the rules. Both commentators have constant uncertainties in this area, which makes them appear unprofessional. For example, when ordering coffee from the (clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or when Ralf Schumacher says "UuuuuHD". The latter brings a lot of confusion to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.  To make matters worse, the advertising takes over at Sky during the final lap. Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising during the race, as can be heard on F1TV. ServusTV and ORF do not do this. Additionally, both channels make less advertising during the training sessions than Sky, and this as a free-TV channel. Although we should thank Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of the program on Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repeats.  In conclusion, Sky is the worst German-speaking channel for F1 coverage. RTL, on the other hand, does a better job, especially considering the advertising. So far, the F1 season has been much less enjoyable than it could have been with a better channel. I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this.

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it hasn't been delivered yet. I contacted the chat twice and haven't received any response.

Lüfterpumpen are ideal for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium. Additionally, it is possible to operate a filter system using air lifts. We offer three variants of this series. Please refer to the table at the end of this offer to compare the specifications. If the pumps are strong enough, they can be used to power entire systems. For larger aquariums, pumps with two or more outlets are recommended so that multiple emitters can be connected. The MK-series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. Lüfterpumpen can also be used to add an accent to an aquarium, such as with an air curtain (available in our shop) or a decoration that converts air bubbles into a functional element, such as a treasure chest, shell, or similar. The MK-series has a unique, soundproof design that minimizes noise during operation. Installation is simple. The lüfterpumpe is connected to an outlet via a 4/6 mm air hose, and it's ready to go. The lüfterpumpe should be the same height or higher than the water level, and it should be placed outside the aquarium. If the lüfterpumpe is placed lower than the water level, a pressure relief valve should be installed between the lüfterpumpe and the outlet to prevent water from flowing backwards through the pump when the water level in the aquarium drops. Simply cut the air hose and insert the valve. This will prevent water from flowing backwards through the pump when the water level in the aquarium drops. If the lüfterpumpe is placed outside, it should be covered and protected from moisture. The pumps in the MK-series are pure power units that consume minimal energy. Although we indicate a processing time of 3 days on eBay, we pack and ship orders daily. If everything runs smoothly, the delivery time is very short. We want to take a little precaution so that no one is disappointed, just because it took a little longer than expected. It's the same as not everyone understands the entire work of their colleagues, who also work in the shipping industry...of course, there's no Corona involved here. Please do not rate us negatively just because the delivery time was longer than expected. This is solely due to the packaging and shipping services. People often complain about these services, even though we are currently saying...it's really difficult. This is also regionally very different. Be kind to everyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that better times are ahead.
How long does it take to order yellow with and without armrests? Can we also order the legs in bright colors here?
Amazon Founder Bezos Sends Astronauts' Daughter and Host into Space  The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers took a brief trip into space on Saturday. They were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The launch and landing of the 10-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas. Upon their return, Bezos personally welcomed the astronauts, who were dressed in blue spacesuits. "Welcome back," he said as he opened the capsule to the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin. According to Blue Origin, the six passengers were aboard for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached an altitude of 107 kilometers.  The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who the rocket system is named after, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company. The other four passengers paid for their tickets. Spacefaring engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron were among them. Blue Origin did not disclose how much each passenger paid for their ticket. Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the flight. She said he had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions. She was just along for the ride, she said with a laugh. Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm. He said he would love to go back into space again, the host said.  The "New Shepard" rocket system flies up to 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface. The International Civil Aviation Organization and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface to be the boundary of space, but there is no internationally binding regulation. It was the third manned spaceflight from Blue Origin. In the first mission in July, Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman. In the second mission in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was also on board, known for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics have accused Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With a simple press of a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain lit in a fixed color or cycle through its entire color palette. When set to color change, the LED stone maintains a light color for approximately one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" LED light ensures year-round durability in outdoor environments. In snowy conditions, its light shines particularly well - just keep in mind that the light duration may be shorter when days are shorter. Please note that in winter, make sure no snow is covering the solar module, which could affect its function. The "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh-Akku in the standard Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if needed. You can order a suitable replacement battery from our webshop to extend the usage time of your decorative LED light.

I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite interesting, even in the lab. I have already completed my practical training in anorganic chemistry. Before starting my studies, I had already informed myself about career prospects and thought that I would study Biochemistry until my promotion. However, now I have doubts, especially since the career prospects seem so uncertain. That's why I would be really interested in: 1) What are you currently working on? 2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary? 3) What did you study/what kind of training did you receive? 4) Would you do it all over again? Thank you for your answers! I am currently unsure and considering whether to drop out of my studies and pursue an education as a Fachinformatikerin. If you have any experience, please feel free to write.
Extra Stress During Holidays and Weekend Ends  This topic came up last week for me. I had to use my long weekend now to relax. That's why I'm writing about it now. Not just during big holidays, like Christmas, do we have a lot of stress in the workplace. It seems like it's also there during weekends plus bridge days. It was like this: Last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, which in Switzerland is called "Aufahrt." On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official. So last week there was a four-day weekend at home. What was going on last week? Just stress. There were so many emails that had to be sent out before Auffahrt, orders here, orders there, all of it *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend. Why? Because "next week then" sounds so far away and that can't be? Or because people are taking everything so seriously in a shortened week that they want to accomplish as much as possible in a normal week? I was stressed out on Wednesday too, and also really tired. What's the point of this self-sacrifice for holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?! The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all independent and self-sufficient. My question is simple: Are we the only ones who feel this way, the Swiss? Is this our reformed-evangelical way of doing things? Or do you know this in the north too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is excited for Christmas in Thuringia Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is excited for Christmas in her Thuringian hometown - but she still has no gifts. "The beautiful thing, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH. She will focus on the holiday by baking and singing with her son. "I love it," said Catterfeld. However, she still has a few things to do before the peaceful days: "For the first time, I still have no gifts, I have to finally let go."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all the necessary vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg biotin/kg. NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather. Most of the feather damage that occurs in birdkeeping is due to nutritional deficiencies. Since the feather is made of protein-rich material, it is particularly important for the bird to have a rich and balanced protein diet for the production of a flawless feather. For proper metabolism, the daily ration must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Most of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to inadequate or imbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed additives is explicitly considered and balanced. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily added to the drinking water or to the soft food.
Thank you, I have found the function, unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are it, I received a bed from you. However, there were problems with one part. The middle beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too small and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet. What do we do now? I cannot build the bed. The middle beam is held by two feet, these are unfortunately faulty. The beam does not fit into the planned holding. Therefore, I will receive new ones. When will they be sent? No flat ones. These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones, they were just too small. But that's okay. The most important thing is that they fulfill their purpose. At me, they are not flat. Could I receive these new ones? Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
House fire with two light injuries and high damage Two people were lightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria. In addition, a estimated damage in the six-digit range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire is believed to have spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke inhalation. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out an intentional arson. The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
Then it comes much later, and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To Refute Fake News - Biontech CEO Publishes Vaccine Photo  Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on LinkedIn in early 2021. Prior to this, he had not publicly disclosed his vaccination status. In his post, Şahin revealed that the decision to share the photo was prompted by the illness of a friend, who was not vaccinated and was struggling with a severe COVID-19 infection. Şahin wrote that he had been hesitant to share personal information about his vaccination status, but a recent call from a friend had changed his mind. He explained that he was deeply saddened to learn that a childhood friend was battling for his life due to a severe COVID-19 infection and was not vaccinated. Şahin did not specify the reasons for his friend's decision not to get vaccinated, but he noted that fear was a common factor. He argued that fear could be difficult to combat with facts, and that it was often better to share personal experiences.  In an interview with Deutsche Welle, Şahin had previously stated that he was not vaccinated against COVID-19. However, he clarified that the interview had been conducted in December 2020, and that at the time, it was not legal for him to receive the vaccine himself. He explained that there was a prioritization system in place for vaccine distribution in Germany, and that he had not yet been eligible to receive the vaccine. Şahin later revealed that he had been vaccinated three times, in accordance with the prioritization system.
Fire in Substation: Thousands of People Without Power In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the power went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases no heating. A fire had disabled a substation. After a fire with severe damage in a substation, thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-District had to be without power for 24 hours. Through the fire, the lights went out at 41,000 affected residents and citizens in several towns. The power supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday, several emergency generators were in operation until the large-scale outage was finally completely restored in the late evening. Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided assistance in the communities. The authorities provided care facilities in schools for the affected residents and called for neighborhood help. The power supplier thanked the affected residents for their patience and the volunteers for their efforts. We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions. We also thank the affected communities, the district, the firefighters, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology region, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage is expected to take several days, as the Westnetz technicians had to provisionally restore some of the power lines at first. According to the company, a technical defect led to the fire. Power is flowing again The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 pm in the substation in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid, Germany, had severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear. Cleaning and repair work were necessary. In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was established. With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored. Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth had power again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected to the power supply from 9:30 pm on Saturday. Since 11:15 pm on Saturday, the last of the affected residents also had power. Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action. The authorities also set up a care facility for the affected residents on Saturday afternoon and called for neighborhood help. "It's important now that the residents take care of their neighbors, especially the elderly and those living alone, and report any help needed to the local fire department," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting. In the setup and operation of emergency generators, the focus was on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, temporary care facilities were set up in schools for those who could not provide for themselves or needed medical equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros? It's the daily roof #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also had a beautiful day and please stay healthy ❤️
I cannot mount the underside on the tabletop. It is custom #NAME#. There are 3 variations. We wanted the one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#. We received 155cm diameter.
Today, my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot combine them and therefore shorten them. Can you help me further? Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose. I would be happy to receive feedback.
Yes, that's really simpler! Then let's do it that way! Can you send me the return receipt via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried to do it before the chat. However, I had not restarted the E-PRS_ORG# before buying it. Should I do it now?
I find this so low invoice almost unexpected. That means we are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination: Riiber Wins The German Nordic Combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have finished on the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää. Defeated again, the duo had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already taken a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER# When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both done it and are using version 4.5... It could be that they have already encountered problems with it.
I have directly purchased a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it. When I try to open it, I get the message "ups! This document could not be opened." The file may be faulty, they suggest contacting customer service. As far as I can see, it is a #PRS_ORG# epub file. Can they help me further?
The chat connection is gone now? I have to work in between!
To ensure even and clean painting, it is recommended to clean the parts with a little soapy water to remove dirt, grease, and fingerprints, then rinse with clear water and let them dry. Before using a new color on the model for the first time, it is recommended to practice with 2 to 3 strokes. This can be done on the back of the parts that will not be visible later or on a yogurt cup. Start with the first stroke on the part with the pencil, pulling it evenly across the surface. Light overlapping of the paint layers will result in a smooth finish. Avoid rapid back-and-forth wiping with the brush, as this can create unrealistic surfaces. A model is not a garden fence. Begin with light colors. Darker colors may become visible later if not used carefully. Metallic tones and metallic paints should be applied last with a separate brush. Using regular paints can result in unattractive metal streaks when mixed with metallic paints. Allow the painted parts to dry for 24 hours before handling. Models achieve their original look through decals or transfer sheets. From national flags on airplanes to ship names and stripes on automobiles, decals give the model its final shine. Apply decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible. It is easier to apply a cockpit to an aircraft model before it is inserted into the fuselage. Time, patience, and a steady hand are just as important as the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers, and a toothpick, when applying decals. Cut each decal individually and carefully place them on the model. Decals are also known as water transfer sheets, as you dampen the back of the paper with water until it becomes dark, then slide the image slightly off the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also dampened). While holding the decal in place with a tool, slide the carrier paper to the side. Be careful not to move the image until you are sure it is in the correct position, as it may stick to your finger, knit, or tear. Squeeze out any excess water with a household sponge. Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and have to unregister and re-register and reload the book and find my place again until I know where I left off. On Saturday, I had already communicated with you before.
Can I receive this via email? Also for all three packages? Because the lamp arrived at my place in three individual packages.
Thank you anyway! Then I will buy it somewhere else as soon as the money is back. Will I be able to get it back easily?
Translation:  Hello everyone, we were in a child wish treatment for some time, and now that it's time to bill with the PKV, it's suddenly becoming a problem. Let's go through it step by step: We had applied for child wish treatment in advance with the PKV and received approval for 3 attempts. The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.). The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was billed with the PKV. A few weeks later, we tried to have another child and conducted 2 unsuccessful attempts, which we did not bill with the PKV yet. We then applied again for the cost reimbursement with the PKV and received approval for 3 more attempts. After a few more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, so we logically billed the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted our bills to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts. The explanation: With the pregnancy/birth, the other 2 attempts from the first approval are invalidated. The second child wish is considered a new insurance case. According to the AGB, "An insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists." Our questions to the experts in the round:  * Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (it should be 5 attempts to reimburse)? * Shouldn't the PKV have informed us that with a birth, the other attempts would be invalidated? * Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not healed by the first child. It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you in advance for your help!
Could you please send me the three variations via email and let me know the best way to reach them?
Order. We will not order anything from them anymore. If they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they must have lost good customers. They can pass it on to their manager. This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been ordered and now you are telling me that I need to return the item first. I can't do anything about the fact that the couch is completely damaged when it arrives at my place, please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote. It is clearly and explicitly stated in the screenshot that the repayment has been ordered and I have not yet received a repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account. We won't do that anymore. No, the defect appeared after a few months. A desk chair must withstand normal use. Otherwise, it cannot be sold as a desk chair. Regardless, the warranty is still valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain a different type of packaging. I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transportation company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG# products. Are these products advertised with additional chairs that we cannot find at your store? Can you help?
Topic of the Week: The Best Low Budget Films A low-budget film, or low-budget movie, is a motion picture that was shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category? What do you like about them? And what do you dislike about them?
Hello,  I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completely furnished two homes with your furniture. I wanted to get the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. The delivery time was extended again, is it now reliable? There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is there no chat? Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I will give up again soon, because it simply does not work here.  Best regards,  [Your Name]
The EU Can Announce a "Half Victory" Against Belarus with High Costs for the EU  The EU can declare a "half victory" against Belarus, according to political expert Raphael Bossong, but the costs will be very high and will result in significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd). The confrontation with the Belarusian regime has not been resolved sustainably, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP). This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely defeated, but the EU feels like a winner - may continue for some time. The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, said Bossong. It appears that there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU member states. Since the EU as a whole does not oppose this, the costs are borne by the fundamental rights. This development weakens the cohesion of the Union. "She can clearly see that she cannot succeed when a member state decides to do its own thing," said Bossong, referring to Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU's border protection agency, access to its border with Belarus. In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the Belarus border, said Bossong: A fundamental principle of asylum policy is being undermined, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. New attempts to cross the border have been made by migrants, according to information from Poland's border guard. On Sunday, 55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border in the night. Polish border guards were reportedly pelted with stones near the town of Czeremsza. A soldier was injured in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted crossings within 24 hours. On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border. Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past few months. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, of luring people to the EU with the prospect of entry. Poland and Lithuania have closed off parts of their borders to the media. The EU has imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country. EU commissioners have also traveled to the countries of origin of the migrants to prevent them from leaving. The most effective element of the EU's response, said Bossong, is the pressure on the airlines. "The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and shown its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions," said Bossong. Minsk must also consider the internal political costs. The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly sends thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has filed a protest after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, claiming that Max Verstappen had broken two rules during the race. According to Mercedes, Verstappen had overtaken a car in front of him during the last safety car phase, which was against the rules. Additionally, Mercedes has lodged a protest against the race result, arguing that the protocol was not followed correctly. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap, just after the safety car phase ended, when he was overtaking the car in front of him.
I am testing it. I am speaking with the bank and reporting back to you again, thank you for the support.
Free Admission for Members: Europa-Park Hosts SC Freiburg Fantag  Europa-Park, the namesake for the Europa-Park Stadion of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, to attend the SC Freiburg Fantag event. According to the park, members and season ticket holders were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day. Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages available. The roller coasters were illuminated with red and white lights. Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red-white helium balloons created the perfect atmosphere, as the park stated.  The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has been in existence since the beginning of the 90s. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag event at Europa-Park, it was once again demonstrated how well the partnership works. Radiant fans were seen, enjoying the thrill of the roller coaster together, confirming the success of the event," said Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

I had a huge anger with you then, when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# suit.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home" as part of the LiteraTour Nord reading series at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday. In addition to reading, she also served as the moderator. She is divorced, lives in a house by the sea, and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar. My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your covered chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you need to fix and not all from our household. Contact Mrs. #NAME#. I cannot chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order for the #PRS_ORG# Nachttisch, and a return label. The email has not arrived yet. Please contact me with friendly greetings.

I'm sorry, but only because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean anything. It's like when someone says they have nothing against foreigners. They won't admit it, but their colleague keeps repeating anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself, then you should just leave it alone. Yes, then you're just as unserious as your colleague. Anyone who seriously questions the fundamental principles of evolution is just completely lost. That's why God created the whole thing. But as soon as you become a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense. And that makes you an enemy of science and not someone to be taken seriously like your colleague.
To obtain an optimal viewing field, the eyepiece should be as close to the eye as possible. The specially designed, aplanatisch-achromatisch lens system allows you to use the eyepiece practically without any registration or color errors up to the edge of the viewing field. Eyepieces are often marked with magnification specifications. However, these specifications apply only to exact, predetermined conditions that are rarely consistent with actual usage conditions. To use your eyepiece optimally, please refer to the technical data in the table (see user manual in packaging). On the lens surfaces of all optical instruments, including magnifying glasses, reflections occur. By applying an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When using the eyepiece under optimal conditions (close to the eye), reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. Additional information can be found in the accompanying user manual (in German and English). Whether as a reading aid for on-the-go or simply for daily use: The Zeiss VisuCard is the ideal helper, as it is compact and can be taken anywhere. Its robust design makes it resistant to everyday wear and tear. Each eyepiece comes with a protective case for storage and safe transport. These cases provide additional protection for the parts you see in the images or are described under "What do you get?" In what condition is the offered article? Of course, everyone can make a mistake, as no one is completely free from errors - if this should happen, simply write a note and it will be clarified (either through exchange, partial refund or full refund). You will receive an invoice. Shipping is always sent, unless otherwise requested by the buyer, insured with tracking number via DHL! The individual shipping costs can be found in the above shipping conditions. There are no additional handling costs.
Sure, I can help you with that. Could you please provide me with the document you want me to translate?
#PRS_ORG# I would be very nice and good service, it took a while until someone came, you were super
Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team, I have already registered with you as a customer contact using the phone number #PHONENUMBER#.

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the town of Krembz, women are searching for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers at the Tannenverkauf. One time, a man had to drive back home without his partner because they couldn't agree. Every year, Diers plants 2000 trees for this purpose. Despite being 56 years old, he has experienced many strange situations. This makes the pre-Christmas season a little more fun, he says.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, I'm out as a customer! After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it. Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to discuss which one is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both have a name because of this. On German, an equivalent might be "Dreher," which sounds quite unappetizing.
Problems with Fiber and Devolo DLan/Magic  We have had a new fiber optic connection in our house for a few weeks now. Unfortunately, I am now experiencing problems building a stable WiFi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit without any issues, except for a few failures. The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to it also receives these speeds. However, on the other DLan module, which is used to transmit WiFi, the speeds are no longer the full 500 Mbit, but rather decrease as I move further away from the module (for example, using a power socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module). This results in slower internet speeds on the first floor, even though the new fiber optic connection is supposed to be much faster (\~45 Mbit). I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which supposedly uses new technology. Although it was slightly better than the DLan, there were still significant losses. Can someone explain why so much internet speed is lost when using fiber optics through the power lines? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables throughout the house. I am really frustrated, which is why I created this account. Therefore, I would greatly appreciate a response.
When is it time to change the checking account? Who would have thought that now, there is finally peace with the checking accounts, they see themselves deceived. While many banks have used the fall to confirm the fee increases of the past with various tricks on their customers, the interest-free periods for negative interest rates are also decreasing. The Deutsche Bank, for example, was previously considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now, it has halved the interest-free period and quadrupled it for daily interest rates. In the first step, the limit was only reduced for customers of the corporate savings account, Postbank - to 50,000 euros for checking and investment accounts and 25,000 euros for daily interest rates. However, these lower interest-free periods now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed on request. And not just for new contracts, but also for "newly agreed individual contracts with existing customers". The Commerzbank was already down to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does ING Germany. The popular direct bank DKB has lowered the interest-free periods in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. It's worth noting that more than 100 banks have now lowered the interest-free period to 25,000 euros or less, as reported by the internet portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros, but there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have filed a lawsuit against this regulation in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin. Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutions should form a reserve - for the case that the upper instances also declare negative interest rates unlawful and many millions of bank customers have to be refunded.
The table delivered was for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people. The underneath is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston has an entire army of beauty assistants, stylists, and trainers taking care of her looks. Despite her hectic schedule, she makes time for a daily chip (yes, that's right: just one chip from the bag). The fact that both male and female fans adore her is a wonder. Maybe it's because she's just bad at luck - and still searching for that true love. And the baby wish is now off the list. People used to ask her constantly when she would become a mother. That hurt her. They have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. We can only hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled his gloves off and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it.

It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class. His biggest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari. He won 21 Grand Prix races, started 18 times from the pole, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Nolte wins the 60th World Cup in the Two-Man Bob - Sports The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's mark with 94 victories is the goal of the German bobsled pilot. "I had calculated it, I had to win 9.5 victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said Nolte, the two-time Olympic gold medalist from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg. On Saturday, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack by 0.5 seconds, moving from third place to first. Then he made a slight adjustment to the material setup and won by 0.3 seconds on Sunday. With his teammates Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the British Brad Hall. The Austrian Benjamin Maier finished third. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Nolte, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive victory. The German Johannes Lochner, who had finished second the day before, came in fifth place this time. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after finishing fourth in the first race. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way too," said Lochner. Nolte won with a home victory - podium for Jamanka In the women's competition, Laura Nolte won her third seasonal victory in the Two-Man Bob on her home track. After finishing fourth in the Monobob on Saturday, she won the World Cup on Sunday with Anschieberin Deborah Levi. Two-time Olympic gold medalist Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, as her teammate. She achieved her first podium finish of the season and also qualified for the Olympics. The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig. "For me, it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I'm super happy that Mariama took me with her," said Burghardt. "There's a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," she emphasized. Jamanka was slightly disappointed with the not entirely error-free runs, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!! What should I do?
I didn't receive it and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked. Due to Corona, I had other problems last year and no time for it. And now it says he has expired, which made me very angry. Look in the chat, it was about the Asare Sitzbank.
I would like to return it and then reorder it since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting on March 16th? There was no information about such a longer delivery time on your website.
No until I click on it, there will be an extra field with the message.
Yesterday, my colleague picked it up. Why is it a problem for me today? I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered items.
However, we still want the shelf module, even a new undamaged one, and not to cancel the entire order.
Today, this week, until XY... Hello lovely girls and women, I have something I just want to write and maybe it goes the same way for one or the other... I am 24, have kPTBS, a full-time student, and a dog mom - except for the fact that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child. My boyfriend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice. I helped him with his shower (because his hand is in a cast due to the burn). He's also cold and we see each other less (1-2 times a week) which makes it very difficult for me with my needs for affection and love. My dog's puppy has just been sick, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has calmed down a bit after I was there with the heating lamp and petting him. I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's gone away for a month. Now we also have housework to do, which we divide up naturally. But even cooking is a lot of work for me... My PTBS illness is well under control, I am halfway through therapy and am getting better. Not good, but I am getting better and am almost symptom-free. My university demands a lot from me (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test that I haven't studied for yet and tomorrow afternoon I have an anatomy lecture that I should at least prepare a little for. And next week I have a oral exam, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left. So my week goes like this: Until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But after that, it goes on forever? Until the birthday. Until the holidays. Until the weekend. Until... And so it goes on forever. I believe, I am just so stressed, that I need these mental anchors, because otherwise I would drown. Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way... Does it go the same way for you? Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work. Honestly, I can't put it into words. I don't know if I would have survived my kPTBS without it. I think it has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought to myself that I might find fellow sufferers here... I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately it is a different color and the surface is scratched, and the leg has an impression. The first delivery was the exact color as on the website. We are very disappointed!!! What can you offer me? If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th. It was sent two more times, but it was not confirmed.
It was completely different then: I remember in school discovering that many religion teachers did not believe in God and saw it as just another subject like math or geography. For me, it was always strange, maybe because I was raised Christian and I always believed in some way. How do you feel about it? Maybe you can also share your experiences with colleagues who have different perspectives. Generally, I understand the difference between personal and professional, and it makes sense to separate them. There are also lesson plans and such. But isn't it strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity? What brings someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? Is it to preserve culture or something? I hope the question is not too personal.
Is it not possible or not? Please write in English, I understand it well. This is already very long, then I would avoid it.
Thank you. I expect a response as soon as possible, no later than the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Hello everyone, I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24). I think it's a movie for teenagers. In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern world (real world). On the other hand, the past (or the land of the dead). Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there's a young woman. And in the land of the dead, there's a young soldier (uniform similar to the soldiers from The Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and create a plot. The antagonist is also a soldier from the land of the dead who wants to bring the woman to that realm to live there himself. I think the transition is the graveyard of the soldier. At the end, both soldiers fight each other. If this helps, I'm grateful for any answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on its stomach since Week 1. Fast forward: still alive :D Relax. So much more out of a child than you think. Make sure everything is in order, no pillows, go in and out more often, but no constant monitoring. That drives you crazy! Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows. Ah, and our little one had no sleep sack, but always a blanket. Observe your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side? Can it lift itself up a little from the stomach? Or is it facing straight ahead with its face directly in the mattress? You can tell by this whether everything is in order. We've all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased many articles. However, why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to you yesterday with a colleague and have not received a response yet. This is regarding my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit in the wardrobe. Please contact me as soon as possible. The wardrobe is currently unusable.
To be completely clear. RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV. But it's just that the politics of this broadcaster has become a mess. Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then they still go on a begging tour. It was said that you were an independent internet sender. Quote Arno: We don't want to be a running fountain pen. What are you now? A 0815 advertising sender who tries to bring BilloMerch to the elite fan. And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne. They can of course continue to insult people. A clown who lacks empathy and tries to make ashes out of rented rooms on a cost basis. How can we find it all good? It's great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I would like a callback, as the delivered wooden table was defective due to a careless delivery by #PRS_ORG#.
As a comfort during stomach ache or just for cuddling – My little warm friend is versatile. Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for warm applications, as cherry pits absorb and release heat efficiently. The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or oven. The soft texture makes the application particularly pleasant, making children feel safe even when they're not feeling well. Cherry pit pillows with a cover are only suitable for the following applications: checking for unusual odors, stains, or burns before heating, and immediately discarding if found. Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before heating! Heat the cushion in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions for the microwave). Immediately distribute the heat evenly throughout the cushion after heating. During the first heating, there may be a slight moisture buildup on the surface, which will disappear with repeated use. Always follow the manufacturer's instructions for heating, as longer heating times or higher energy consumption can cause damage (fire and burn hazard!). Check the user manual of the microwave before heating the cushion to ensure that heating of cherry pits is allowed. After the heated cushion is returned to the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (maximum of 43 °C). Do not use the cushion for acute and chronic, inflammatory, or feverish conditions, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, bleeding, or open wounds, or for people with reduced pain sensitivity. For people with existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, or for pregnant women, please consult a doctor before use. If the seams open and the cherry pits come loose, discard the product and the loose cherry pits immediately and out of reach of children. If the cushion is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the baby during use should be regularly monitored to prevent overheating. All incidents related to the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authorities in the country where the user is located. The cover is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in the washing machine. Please pay attention to the care instructions on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the cellar. It's also not going well for Ingolstadt under the third trainer. Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, happiness in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead? Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) could not be charged through the power supply. I bought the power supply about 5 months ago, so it should still work. I thought that the power supply alone would be enough to operate the laptop. Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even with the power supply plugged in. After removing the battery, nothing happened either. Do you have any ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in power mode? Is there something else that's broken? Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to my room. How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair. However, I do not know how high the seat is.
Are you often on tour and still carrying a lot of gear? With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, you don't have to worry! This backpack has a 20-liter capacity that can easily accommodate larger photo gear without any problems. The padded FlexFold panels allow you to securely stow your gear and keep it organized. And with the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series now features a new look. The sleek, minimalist design is both functional and stylish, and Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions to protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to your photo gear.  There are two ways to do this: conventionally by using the magnetic latch closure on the top of the backpack, or by using the side zippers on both sides of the backpack. The side zippers eliminate the need to rummage through the contents of the backpack, making it much more practical for everyday use. Additionally, the side zippers allow you to access the backpack from either side, making it even more versatile. Comfortable, adjustable shoulder straps make it easy to carry your gear, and the outer shell of the backpack is made from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon. So you can rest assured that your gear will stay dry, even if you're heading to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# informed me yesterday that they would confirm the contact request from the shipping company for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table. I have not received any message yet. I request immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support employee, but so far I have only received a promise that I will receive a confirmation email. This concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered custom #NAME#
It's clear when the wardrobe can be delivered again? Holding it like this isn't an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. Wish you all a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were on January 12, 2021.
I received a completely different lamp than what I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture and not sent it back. And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not know and did not have the opportunity to redeem it and clarify it in a timely manner. But the damage, I accept as a customer.
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to evaluate reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake pads are cast and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut). All tested pads are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain pads and patterns. Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which focuses on the expansion of the pad according to the properties of the original mounting. The pads manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness. In addition, created openings increase the cooling effectiveness of the pad, while the slots improve the cleaning of the brake pads and rotors. Aesthetic properties of our tested pads emphasize the character of each car through attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern tip of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and triggered the California Gold Rush of '49. Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and most prosperous cities in the country. Land was staked, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted a piece of the wealth of the land. For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, raise horses, and build businesses. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and territories. You are not alone - other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must outdo your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt. Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game where you must simultaneously choose your actions, manage your resources, and build a tableau that works for you. The buildings on your tableau allow you to be more efficient, get additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage. With these buildings and dynamic game pieces, you can develop your own unique playing style. Coloma is played over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma) to 1850 (the year California became a state). Each year in Coloma consists of five rounds. During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can take actions. After their choices are revealed, they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pioneers, it gets a freeze! This deactivates half of the location, reducing the possible actions there. Then, players take turns performing actions such as gathering resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening stores, and positioning revolvers. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return. The game board rotates at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions. This continues until the game board has been rotated five times, or until the end of the year. There is also a shootout, where players must defend Coloma against an attack by angry bandits. If they have enough revolvers and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards. If they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up in the graveyard. The game ends after the third shootout, and then the final scores are tallied. The player with the most points wins! If you want to send the game as a gift, I can send it up to a size of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm with free shipping. For all other sizes, I recommend using DPD with tracking and insurance. If you are a collector, I can also send the game in a collector's box for an additional fee of 2 Euros. This ensures that there are no printing issues.
"Why Children Aren't Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW Psychological Violence, Sexual Abuse, Power Abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately. >Child psychologist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about education. Former patients and education experts now raise serious accusations against him. Please be careful, the film is difficult to watch. And I am grateful that many people now think and act differently. Our parents and other responsible people should never seek power over the child. Our goal should always be to give the child space for their development and create a framework that is as large as possible in the given situation. Brrr, I am still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss lifting test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals The health ministers of the states are set to decide at their next meeting on a nationwide lifting of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals. "We need clarity quickly on whether and when the test requirement can be lifted for triple-vaccinated individuals," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, in an interview with Bild am Sonntag. The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sound, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has announced that he will present a proposal to the health ministers' conference on the matter on the coming Tuesday. - afp
I want to send the lamp back. How do I do it best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS_ORG# account. Error message: Ups, an error has occurred. Purchase through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is not working. I have updated my account information. What could be the reason?
What you describe as *Awareness* refers to sensory perceptions under full narcosis. These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000. The most common occurrence is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images, and the least common is perceiving pain. For this topic, relevant: Kaiserschnitte are operations that are associated with an increased rate of Awareness, as we avoid very deep narcosis for the protection of the child until the umbilical cord is cut. Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
The chair is unfortunately defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ also does not help us. These are legal warranty claims. The absolute minimum would be for them to return the defective chair. This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard practice in the eCommerce industry. Please check again if they can at least return the defective chair. We will then sell the second chair privately. Unfortunately, we will also lose some money in the process.
I already sent you an email that you did not respond to. Please answer my question again. In the order and invoice, it states that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The courier is company #NAME#. I just called there and they told me that they can only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#. Is that so? If yes, I have to cancel the order, as I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me. Who would I call then? I had a question formulated
Theater historian Günther Rühle has passed away at the age of 97. He had established a profile as a theater critic and as an intendant. Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97. There is still a new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Becomes Older". This is the heart-wrenching diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle conducted until April 2021. And in the middle of the reading comes the news that the author has passed away. The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby acknowledge my debt to life."
There are various types of pallets. One of the most common are Europalettes, standardized wooden pallets that are widely used as load carriers in the European region. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL. According to statistics from Austria in 2020, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria, with a production value of approximately 79 million euros. The amount of pallets imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

Rouladen Tips and Tricks  I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash. It was delicious and buttery! Thank you again :) Now I'm used to the taste and want to try making rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I'll start with a beef broth. Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What is happening with the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#? My English is not as good as it used to be, but I will get there.
The document is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was informed via email on 18.01 that the refund was successful. However, the money is still not in my account. Could you please check?
Where in Lübeck there is still Christmas goose or duck for many people, like the Christmas tree and gifts. Have you not taken care of any feathers yet? Now time is running out. We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas goose in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a Röhrenendstufe plays a significant role in the warmth and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound. This feature is perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor-Switching circuit. With the VOLUME-, GAIN-, and MASTER VOLUME-Regulators, you can adjust the volume and distortion of your sound accordingly. Additionally, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL-Regulator, which allows you to reduce the volume without affecting the gain and distortion. Furthermore, the POWER LEVEL-Regulator can also be used to reserve power when needed. This means that you can use the full potential of the VT+ series in any situation. The headphone output can also be used as a line output. The signal is processed with a box simulation, so you can experience an eminent "acoustic" sound impression when using headphones or making direct recordings. You can connect a CD player or MP3 player to the AUX input, so you can jam to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also built-in, so you don't need a separate tuning device. If you want to control the sound with your feet, you can use a VFS5 footswitch. This is especially useful for live performances. With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
I had seen it differently at others. Is there then a possibility for you to send the lamp back? Since it hangs too low over the dining table? Therefore, I would like to send it back. Can you help me with that?
And the furniture? Do we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chair?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with an inheritance or a voucher. In some cases, I might find a buyer for the furniture. But only if the items I don't need cost more than 1,000 Euros then it's a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were included in the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not improved. Do you have a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in Atom Accord Talks According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in talks to revive the international Atom Accord. "Both sides are now close to agreeing on the issues that are on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, as reported by the Iranian news agency Irna. This is a "positive and important development," said Bagheri, because initially there was no agreement on the topics to be discussed. The Atom Accord aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. Talks in Vienna resumed on Thursday after a nearly two-week hiatus. Negotiators from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the talks. A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia surpasses Saxony - Free State with highest Corona-Incidence  Thuringia has overtaken Saxony-Anhalt and now has the highest Corona-Incidence in Germany. Only one federal state has a value above 1000. Only one federal state has a Corona-Incidence above 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony-Anhalt, which had the highest incidence in Germany until Sunday, the value was 990.5. In Thuringia, the incidence was slightly lower on Friday and Saturday, but still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported on Sunday. 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals on Sunday. There may be delays in reporting on weekends. In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the collection of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery starts in early March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print and attach this to the package and give it to the post office, is that correct? Here do I need to click/point/fill out anything else?
I want to avoid exactly this, that's why I am writing to you. I would like you to please take care of the return on your own cost. In my opinion, a return shipping fee of 8 euros is audacity.
It's time for changes ###MBundestag seid mir gegrüßt, ich bin u/StratorDE im Plenarsaal im Herzen von Europa an einem fantastischen Tag! #Wozu der Post hier? Wenn man sich mal die Aktivität in den vergangenen Monaten des MBundestags ansieht kann man eins feststellen: Sie ist nicht extistent. Wir sind in eine Winterstarre gekommen und haben das Sommerloch auf einige Monate ausgeweitet. #Wo liegt das Problem? Ja, woran hat es gelegen? Zum Großteil dürfte das einfach mit der Unzufriedenheit zusammenhängen, wie hier einige Dinge abgelaufen sind und wie wir generell darstehen. In den letzten Tagen hat sich vermehrt der Eindruck gezeigt, dass viele hier echt noch Bock auf den MBundestag haben. #What we need to do At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked what keeps it alive. The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found a "broken pile" of things. After some back-and-forth, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project. However, I would like to explicitly invite everyone to participate, only then can this project have a future. We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas and work on concrete things. You can join the server via this link. Goals:  * How should the MBundestag function in the future? * Which existing orders need to be changed, adapted or removed? * How should we present ourselves to the outside world? * How should new members be recruited? * How can we create a fair election system?  I am quite sure that I have forgotten something, but that's not a problem, we have the Discord at the end. If you have time and interest, come to the Discord, work with us and let us decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp shade from you that has not been delivered yet. Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for that purpose and not suitable for my taste. For this reason, I have already ordered a different hanger from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope it will be returned and I will have a full refund. This is also sad because #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# also come in large sizes, such as 240/240?
#PRS_ORG# must ensure that the faulty wardrobe is picked up promptly. Please arrange for a suitable packaging. I don't have any packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup. #PRS_ORG# should clarify how this works. #PRS_ORG# can always call me on the phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for assembly? How long would I have had time to take care of this or make a decision about sending it back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? I had a conversation with a colleague today who I really like. She has lived vegetarian for a while and eats meat very rarely now. I was also a vegetarian for a few years before. When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned step, I answered honestly. I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would be supporting animal welfare, but I eventually realized that I was actually supporting animal cruelty. That's why I decided to become vegan. At that moment, I felt like she was upset and defended vegetarianism, saying she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, we reduce animal suffering. Now, I'm wondering if my answer was too blunt. How do you answer the question? Do you feel like being a vegan puts you in a difficult position and creates conflicts without intending to? It greets a loving vegan (;
This is not an exception as per Section 312d of the German Civil Code. Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am at the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my retoure not on site. Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately it cannot be changed. Can you please assign me an alternative pickup date? Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available on site.
Lahnsteiner Water Rescue Vehicle Equipped: The Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister, Roger Lewentz, recently presented a check for 45,000 euros to Lahnstein's Mayor, Peter Labonte, in the Lahnstein Town Hall for the purchase of a new water rescue vehicle for the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, is 135,000 euros. A valuable investment in safety. "I am delighted that the Rhineland-Palatinate government is supporting us here," says Lahnstein's Mayor, Peter Labonte. The vehicle is used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate. They perform tasks such as water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance, both above and below water. In Lahnstein, it is expected that there will be an increase in incidents: The growing popularity of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations, synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, but nothing worked. I'm a little frustrated because it took me a lot of time to do all of that and I hope for help now.
Okay, so. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June. Can I enter a deadline in the order process?

Thank you for being here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar role, we were also soldiers in the executive branch, I don't want to go into it any further! The question of left and right is always simplified in my opinion. Generally, one should say that the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone. It should also be clear that people who are right-wing and wear uniforms and carry weapons are also more likely to be attracted to the conservative right, but that these people may have difficulty dealing with reality. Since you have both the average white, now many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine gay stereotype here, but rather normal men and women whom no one notices when they don't tell anyone) and also these people, I have to rely on them, because in doubt, they will save your life or set it for you. But these fringe groups also represent a conservative stance, although it may sound funny at first, they are proud of Germany and feel less threatened by overly left-wing politics, even if these politics are supposed to be for them, they just want to be treated normally. Back to the right, since the police and military are also a cross-section of society, extreme right-wingers can be found there too, but these are the ones who openly express their opinions or even plot state-threatening plans, which is medially exaggerated and bothers me. It often happens that police officers and soldiers, who have been deployed abroad, become more cynical and say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences. It also happens that right-wing ideologues meet and have a lively exchange of ideas. However, this is fought well and also with political education and enlightenment, the whole thing is countered! Germany is so internationally interconnected and that is also good in my opinion, because we wouldn't be able to have right-wing extremists and Nazis in our ranks if we weren't so connected to the rest of the world.
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side. Why should this come from England? As I ordered it, it was not sold out. I ordered it in November.
I was informed that in your confirmation of the order it was confirmed.
The issue is still with my order, which is no longer available. I had previously communicated with #NAME#. As an alternative, it is possible to deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black to Germany, or perhaps this basket is also available somewhere in Germany. I always find you to be a great partner company.
However, on the edge of the wooden board are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Hello, I have been dealing with a matter for a long time. I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but I have been struggling to keep my household clean and organized throughout my life. There are always phases where everything stays messy, and then suddenly it hits me and I clean up and tidy up. But it's never like that someone can spontaneously come to visit. My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time he loses the household against work and lack of interest. The kitchen is always cleaned regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with children? We don't have any yet, but we are working on it and this question has been bothering me for a long time. For me, there is no motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much as long as no one comes to visit and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable. Is there a greater motivation with children or do we remain sloppy? I look forward to your answers.
The new, high-quality, and anatomically formed cut offers maximum comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted movement. The preformed shape with special reinforcement at the joints for improved movement (elbow and knee joints) was increased by more than doubling the covered area in the Flex System 2 to further enhance comfort. Stretch panels without seams at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, elbows, and knees) and high-quality preformed shapes in the lower back area and feet provide a snug, perfect fit. An elastic 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the spinal cord and improves comfort, especially when bending or mounting and attaching equipment to the surface. The free flex zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility during arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warming, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of heat protection. When positioned on the chest, it provides warmth to a sensitive area of the body. A seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal around the face on the helmet increases comfort, the seal and the durability (separate helmet) A soft, cushioned zone in the neck area improves the seal with a fine adjustable width through a flexible, gentle closure that does not adhere to the casing or seams. Double hinges with a locking mechanism connect an adjustable inner sleeve with a soft, covered outer sleeve at a 45-degree angle at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and load capacity during pulling. A long locking mechanism at the neck with an elastic reinforcement for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall level without a helmet. A G-Lock P rear locking mechanism (overall without a helmet) with a metal sliding mechanism and integrated water dam system for improved sealing. Reinforcements with Neoprene at all ends of the locking mechanisms to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels bonded together with outer and inner overlapping edges of the outer sleeves for increased load capacity. Cutouts in the edges of the inner sleeves for increased flexibility. The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in place, specifically for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder? I have a degree in software development and have been working in this field for about a year now. However, I notice more and more that this job is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a while now. The problem: I have an insecure (or avoidant) personality disorder (IPD). This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it's very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I've been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I think I've improved on that). Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family services. I don't know if the actual workday will be as I imagine it, and it's hard to find information about it online. My IPD is already causing problems in my current job (emotionally for me), as it makes me feel down every time there's something wrong with my code ("again, the simplest things are broken") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding them back with my dumb questions"/"they must think I'm stupid" etc.). The problems I would likely face in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you get the sofa back? Because there was no confirmation for it.
I am waiting for a pickup time. Please let me know what you would like to return.
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, will the message "Ihr #PRS_ORG# authorisiert dieses Buch nicht gibt es da" appear if there are problems?
I was in a chat with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein obtained from the feed is broken down by the bird's stomach-intestinal tract into individual amino acids. These amino acids are then used to build up the bird's own protein tissues, which are also needed for feather growth. Feather growth in nestlings and feather regrowth in molting birds are very complex processes and are highly demanding on the bird's overall system. It is important to note that NEKTON-Bio should not be given during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the breeding process. After this short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, it is recommended to switch back to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

It is recommended to prepare only as much water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/soft food daily. A tablespoon (included) corresponds to 1 gram of NEKTON-Bio. In case of severe feather damage, it may be necessary to give a double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio at the beginning, until the onset of feather regrowth is visible. After that, the normal dose should be maintained until the feather regrowth is complete. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry and without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
I apologize, but the chair will be sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That's really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and pictures were attached. Did you receive the email?
Statement of a Community Worker in Opposition to the Constitution Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem. On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled. Therefore, a felling request was submitted to the community. A staff member writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including the walnut, is not part of the constitution. However, the constitution explicitly states that the walnut is a protected tree. Can I now rely on the statement of the staff member or not? On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the constitution is clear. Thank you for your responses.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't receive any news, then I still have a sofa without use. Could you offer me a legacy or a voucher? What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe the question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the ceiling delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Urgent Report: A severe traffic accident occurred recently on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg. According to the current police press alert (14:03 Uhr), a car has collided with oncoming traffic while overtaking. There are injuries.
Ah okay, I understand. Good, then thank you again that it was so simple!
Dear all,  I hope this message finds you well. My Christmas is unfortunately not the best, as my head is always filled with thoughts of everything that can be thought of. Before I continue, let me say that I need advice and preferably from people who have some idea of my situation - so from you.  I am currently in the process of starting a new career as a refugee. Originally, I had studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain anonymous, I won't say any more). However, I found it all too boring and started looking for alternatives that would be more fun. Eventually, I landed a job in teaching and was sure that was it - even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.  Now, I'm on my third "I'm going to Google other job postings" phase. It's been six months since I started, and I'm starting to feel like I'm not making any progress. With the previous paintings, I had always decided to continue and at least finish the project, but now I'm absolutely done. I had so little free time in the last month that I'm completely drained. Now, even though it's Christmas break, there's still a pile of work waiting for me.  Before starting the project, I thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was my evening. I had some free time then, and the stress on the job was non-existent. Now, I'm finding the family Christmas to be too stressful. And then there are these rigid structures that are adding to my stress. Overall, the project is going well from an outside perspective, in terms of feedback and such. But I'm completely drained, and I'm starting to wonder how much stress my body can take before it shuts down completely.  I'm starting to question whether I want to continue down this path - especially since I've read some of your contributions - or if I should go back to my old field, where I was valued, had some free time when I needed it, and the work, while still boring, was at least fairly compensated. But then I wonder if I'll be in the same situation a year from now, still feeling unfulfilled.  I hope you can understand how confusing and overwhelming this situation is for me. Any advice or ideas you have would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my message, and I apologize if my tone came across as too emotional. I hope my situation has become a little clearer to you.  Best regards,  [Your Name]
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a vacuum tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is simply impressive. These amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix vacuum tube preamplifier, which is partly based on real analog circuits because they better capture the tone variations and nuances of a vacuum tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers feature a closed enclosure and a bass reflex system, which allows the natural resonances to sparkle only so much. With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you always imagined. The perfect combination of vacuum tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Although it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, it was again responsible for a power boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and a variety of improved amplifier models. From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will find it here. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a vacuum tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string strikes, and a quick response. During an incoming analysis, VOX engineers discovered that above all the output stage determines the character of a vacuum tube amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+-amplifier is equipped with a 12AX7 vacuum tube, which perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances and the sound character of a vacuum tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it was not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable closure parts, it fits perfectly to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras. What finally fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses. A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash. Larger DSLM cameras like the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for more lenses. Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories. And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photo accessories. Also, drone pilots meet with the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal solution, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Vulcan Eruption on La Palma: Longest in History  In the past three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island of La Palma have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands. Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585, which lasted 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data on earlier eruptions.  The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists are still unable to predict when it will end. The indicators suggest a slowdown. The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, in an interview with the state-run TV station RTVE.  Damage in Millions  In the past three months since the start of the eruption, the more than 1000-degree lava has destroyed over 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava, which is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 people had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated at more than 900 million euros.  Two new landmasses have formed off the coast due to cooled lava, with a combined area of approximately 50 hectares. The banana plantations, which are of immense importance to the island, were heavily affected. About half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants depend directly or indirectly on the banana industry, which was already in crisis before the eruption.  225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were severely affected, as reported by the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and gifts Christmas is just around the corner and especially the children are eagerly awaiting the heavenly feast. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are connected with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something tempting. Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving as a conscious decision, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss is a peace-making "social contract of savage peoples", escapes the rigid routine and is filled with life in the context of this tradition. Just as Nikolaus became the Christ Child, the Protestants were the ones who linked Christmas with gift-giving. Before that, gifts were given in various ways on the Nikolaustag. The background of this popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, is said to have thrown gold coins into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin. From this unusual way of giving arose the German custom of filling the children's stockings with gifts. Protestants objected to this custom because they saw it as a form of saint worship. Therefore, they rejected the institution. Martin Luther introduced the idea of the Christ Child and shifted the focus of gift-giving to Christmas Eve. Although most Protestants no longer see the details so clearly, only a few are still annoyed that the tradition of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas tradition with Martin songs and Martin parades, still exists as a fixed part of the pre-Christmas season. Today, one can find everything from socks to luxury watches in the stockings and under the Christmas tree that the heart desires. Traditions of gift-giving have been documented in Christian countries since the 13th century on the feast day of Saint Nicholas. With the Reformation, the day of gift-giving was shifted to Christmas Eve. In all Christian countries, there is a joyful atmosphere over the question of who will bring the children their gifts. In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who is essentially a kind of Saint Nicholas, appears with time some individual characteristics assigned. These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure of the Christmas festival. In Spain, the Three Wise Men bring the gifts, while in Italy, the witch Befana brings them the way to the baby Jesus. In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring the gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought them some fame. Here, instead of reindeer, three horses pull his sleigh. In the Czech Republic, which is the homeland of the Reformation in the context of the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shoots suspected bank robber near King's Palace In London, on Saturday, a armed man was shot by the police. The police stated that callers had reported a man with a weapon who had entered a bank and the accountant's office. The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers. Shots were fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene. The police did not suspect a terrorist motive. There are several embassies located in the area around the King's Palace. The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into every beet, garden, or rock garden. The light can be easily set up and can be securely anchored in the ground with two earth spikes. An integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module is used for optimal charging of the built-in battery. The maximum light duration is 10 hours. - The robust plastic housing is suitable for use all year round in outdoor areas. In Hollywood-style shows, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully on the inside. On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone ensures that this solar light shines brilliantly – either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The smooth, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself in the daytime. Its organic curves fit perfectly into any natural environment – whether on the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden. It also works well in the presence of larger pebbles and rocks, where its size allows it to hold its own. You can save a lot of effort: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries. Simply place the "Stone Light" on any sunny spot. Two earth spikes are provided for secure anchoring if needed. The matt white plastic housing itself is robust and weather-resistant. The solar module is discreetly integrated into the interior, along with the battery and two LEDs – one for white light and the other for colored light. The battery charges automatically when sunlight falls on the casing. When the light begins to fade, "Smart Stone" starts glowing on its own; you can choose the color yourself: Six attractive light colors are available to you – in addition to daylight white. The automatic shutdown also occurs when the battery charge level reaches a minimum or when it gets too bright. The charging cycle starts again the next day when the sun comes out.

Dear Ladies,  I hope I'm doing everything right here, after a year on Reddit, it's actually my first post. To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible cramps during my period and terrible PMS before my period. Now I would like to keep it that way, because I already have to take so many medications due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose. My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin. I had a sudden outbreak of hives all over my body during my last two-year break from the pill, and it was really exhausting. Even after two years, it hasn't normalized yet. Maybe someone has some tips to prevent this from happening again. My cosmetics are already parfume-free and without dyes, but maybe there's something else that someone can recommend. Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still scheduled. Thank you to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, the love of the skin is such a thing. I had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread hives and the acne theme. I tried everything with my diet in the context of chronic illness, and I ended up on a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat-free, because nothing else worked properly. It can also be good that hormonally it's just a worm in there, but when you're like me and everything is a construction site, it's better not to look for anything else that might go wrong.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
I had already written everything for my colleague's seminar or whatever, and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request. I have to work in between and call the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...

In the name of the people: lay judges sit in the courtroom in everyday clothing on the judge's bench. However, their judgment is crucial, even if they do not wear robes: jurors decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone is sentenced to prison. Two of them report in conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I am not able to access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again using the order number #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
What can we do with the packaging material? We don't have the ability to keep it for that long. We would use the table as they suggested, as if it were ours.
Dear, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, since they are so beautiful now, I would like to order another one in gray.

The 110-kV power cable will be built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding. The decision of the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction, which will begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk now. The approximately seven-kilometer long cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt power line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead power line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.

You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday!! This is a glass cabinet and the entire surface is shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken. The cabinet is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations. This means that the cabinet cannot be picked up, because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request is at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem.
Subject: Planning Lessons (EK)  Dear Colleagues,  I have been in the Ref since summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I currently face significant challenges in planning efficient lessons in the subject of Erdkunde. Unfortunately, my school is not well-equipped technologically, so I can only use the table, textbook, and OHP as teaching materials. In the school, I can only copy software for free (which is frustrating for Erdkunde). It takes me a long time to plan my lessons, and for example, we are currently studying the theme of Geofaktoren, and each hour stands for itself. The methods are repeated, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I approach planning from the learning objective (what do I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build on it (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have). We have the book Terra, and with most of the tasks in the book, I am not satisfied. That's why I also create worksheets. Maybe a geography teacher can help me work more efficiently with the book Terra. I would be very happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#. I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business. Only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed to enter most stores. The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales declines. A possible solution has been prepared. According to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE), the 2G regulations are damaging to the retail trade. Stefan Genth, CEO of the HDE, criticized the Umsatzeinbrüche in stores that sell non-essential goods. According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively. Many had already written off the Christmas business. "What should have been the highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth. Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week. Only the grocery trade and the online business are doing well. The HDE demanded consequences from the dramatic development. According to Genth, shopping with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe option. "2G shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations scare off customers and require high personnel and administrative efforts. Genth called for the federal government to approve the Bändchenregelung, which would require each customer to be checked only once for 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all stores on that day with the received Bändchen. In addition, Genth suggested that random spot checks should be sufficient in the retail trade, as is already the case in public transportation with the 3G regulation (vaccinated, cured, or tested). Wilhelm Wellner, CEO of the Deutsche Euroshop real estate company, also spoke about the difficult Christmas business. The customer frequencies were last measured without 2G at around 75% of the pre-crisis level, and the sales were at around 90%. These figures will now fall in the middle of the important Christmas business season. Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, the centers will try to find solutions and apply for approval. Among these solutions is the so-called Bändchenlösung, which would allow visitors to provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, to enter all stores without further checks. dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#. The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also an error on the frame that was attempted to be covered up with yellow putty. It looks unsightly. I would like to return the Spiegel and have already repackaged and sealed it. How do I proceed with the return now?
The DL3120 lamp is designed for dual-balance operation, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction. For adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with advanced features is used. In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and tungsten. It is also possible to manually adjust the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K and save it. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is its simplicity and intuitive operation. The lamp produces a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The beam angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent. It is also suitable for use in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances. You can adjust the brightness almost without changing the color temperature. The DL3120 is a great tool for working both on film sets and in studios. The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lamp in TV studios or when the lamp is mounted in hard-to-reach locations. On the back of the lamp is a control panel consisting of buttons and a bright display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, there is a slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery). The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To store the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons for a longer period and release it. The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to a specific color temperature. Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. The use of NP-F batteries allows for operation with favorable battery power. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can use existing equipment. The DL3120 can be checked before the set to ensure that the batteries have sufficient power - a built-in battery tester is included. In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the lamp with power through the included power supply. The construction of the lamp is very simple. It has a 16mm housing as an attachment, so you can directly connect it to your camera. The tilt is adjustable with screws on both sides, ensuring reliable adjustment. It was paid special attention to ensure that the mechanical components are of high quality and designed for durability and heavy use. Additionally, a tilt bracket is included in the delivery. Great is also the inclusion of a carrying case in the delivery. So you can transport the lamp with all the accessories you may need to buy later without any problems.

"The Party We Wanted to Celebrate": Frankfurt's Spectacular Comeback Against Leverkusen  Frankfurt is celebrating after a thrilling 5-2 victory over Leverkusen in the Bundesliga. After 22 minutes, the Hessen team, who had lost their last two games in a row, found themselves on the brink of another Bundesliga crisis. But then, the SGE turned things around, scoring four goals in just over an hour to leave their frustrations behind and win fiercely.  "It's insane what the boys did today," said trainer Oliver Glasner on DAZN, giving a "praiseworthy performance to everyone who was there." At first, it looked like another setback for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, with Patrik Schick putting Leverkusen in a 2-0 lead. But what happened next left even the SGE trainer speechless.  "How the players came back and put on a fantastic performance," said Glasner. "I'm absolutely crazy happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result. Even Christopher Lenz, who had been out for four games due to a muscle injury, was back on the field and boosted the morale of his teammates.  "I believe our mental strength is unbelievable," said the 27-year-old. "I'm especially happy for the fans. That was the party we wanted to celebrate today."  Glasner now wants to focus on the upcoming tasks, but he is optimistic about the team's prospects. "It's amazing that we have all our players fit in December, that they are all physically in top shape," said the trainer. "It's top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live professionally."  Now, the team needs to "take it step by step and remain humble" while continuing to perform at this level until the end of the year. The next challenge comes on Wednesday, with an away game against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky).
I am receiving a grade for the package that was returned to you due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect the call, but there was no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is canceled again? Unfortunately, this would mean that I would not be able to order again because it has already taken too long.

The German women's handball team slipped into the Viertelfinale match against Spain with their heads hanging low and empty gazes after a humiliating loss to Denmark in the final match of the World Cup group stage. The DHB selection lost 16-32 (8-13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the host nation Spain in the next round. "We were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener. "Against Spain, we have to play differently. After the first loss in the tournament, we finished the group stage III with 8-2 points as the runner-up behind the Danish team (10-0). It's a shame that we couldn't maintain the flow," said captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for the quarterfinals, Germany needs a significant improvement on Tuesday to keep the dream of the first medal since 2007 alive. The best German shooter in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and urged: "We have to look forward now." From the beginning to the end, the German team was not up to par with the start. Misses and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a 0-4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on form and prevented worse with some saves. The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack. The hoped-for initial spark was not there. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they often failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavians. So the game was over after 20 minutes with a score of 3-10. Backcourt player Mia Zschocke was sent off shortly afterwards due to a foul. In the quarterfinals, however, she should be able to participate again. Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB team come a little better into play and at least manage to score five goals before the break. The faint hope of a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes with a score of 9-19. Again, the German players sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who is considered one of the medal contenders in the final round. In the end, the German team could not recover and left the court as clear losers.

The title suggests that I am an impunity doctor working in mobile impunity teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer impunity vaccine is administered, mainly in nursing homes. As these are almost finished, it will continue to some extent in impunity centers for me. I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g., "I take medication X, does it work with the impunity?"). In my area of responsibility falls the education on impunity, the indication setting (the person has a right to impunity according to the Coronavirus impunity regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me). The impunity itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical technical assistants. In impunity teams, we often have no one there, but only (thank God no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the impunity vaccine, who cannot administer impunity themselves (can they?), so that I have to do most of the impunity myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer"-Question: Amberger knows the solution, what is a "Huidlerer"? With this dialect word, sent by an Amberger, there was concern in the BR-TV show "Wir in Bayern". But unlike many preceding days, the concept remained unrecognized by the callers. No, it was not a "man who is nervous". And also not one "who everything goes fast". The people heard from the TV moderator that this was completely wrong. What the man from Amberg revealed and probably also caused astonishment among many Upper Palatines. "The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a cloth with which someone wipes the oven". Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by the Bayerischen Fernsehen for years as an expert, confirmed this. With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the better-known Mundart word "Houdern". What was probably closed was an educational gap - probably also among many who have been living in the Amberger area for a long time.

Translation:  Is it really that safe to choose tires when riding a bike? I woke up early this morning with a lot of excitement because I wanted to train for my upcoming bike tour in the next week. I got on my new bike that I bought on eBay yesterday and started riding. The first 40 kilometers were great, but then something happened that I had been expecting (this time in Krefeld). There were glass shards on the road. Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the way. Since I couldn't get a replacement tire and inner tube on the weekend, I had to turn back and take the first bike path home. It wasn't that bad, but it wasn't great either. Maybe it's better if I practice changing tires before my bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and hope you can help me. Since I have a long route over several days ahead of me, I don't want to encounter this problem again. It wasn't that bad this time, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who picked up the bike at 14:00 and had ridden 120 kilometers on them) and the ones he considered suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years. If I think about it, I'll need to change tires after 80-90 kilometers. I'm really not in the mood for that. Now I'm talking to an older man at the train station who asked me why I didn't use Marathon Plus tires; they're supposed to be puncture-proof. It all sounds very tempting. But are they really that puncture-proof? I don't have much enthusiasm left to spend 40 euros on tires and be disappointed. Moreover, I'm wondering if it's a problem that I'm using 25x622 on my bike. There are Marathon Plus tires available, but most of them are wider. Is this a problem? Or would you recommend a different tire for a bike? The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD. Thank you in advance for your help, and have a great day!
Car crashes into tree: Driver seriously injured A 53-year-old man was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten when, for unknown reasons, his car collided with a median barrier and then spun onto the opposite lane.

Hello everyone,   We are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year! Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which has increased our planning efforts and explains the short notice of the announcement. However: At least three people will be on set, so we will be able to stream the Oscars 2021 with at least seven people. We hope to have thousands of you following us!   We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still pandemic – nonetheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible for you.   It will start around 0:30. Make sure to have cold drinks ready, plan some good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
