觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证 这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！ 普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。 众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。 这个时候便是需要急救的时候。 如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！ 所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！ 当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。 “在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。 在美国全国是平均15%能救过来。 在拉斯维加斯的赌场酒店，百分之七八十能救过来，上海、北京低于1%。” 这是第一反应创始人陆乐说的。 如果一个人发生了心脏骤停，呼吸没有了，心跳没有了，你掐人中是没有任何作用的。 必须做人工呼吸、胸外按压才有可能把人救过来。 我发现我们现在还很少人会有这种意识去学习急救，但是当事情发生的时候就来不及了，所以还是呼吁大家都去学习一下这个技能，让我们在面对突发状况的时候能够及时作出反应。 说不定还能挽救一个人的生命！ 急救证可以在你们当地的红十字会培训中心报名，我是在珠海的红十字会培训中心报名的，学生还有优惠呢。 PS：最后一张图是记录自己25岁前要完成的目标的，把急救证加入目标清单也是几个月前的事情，但是确实是完成了呀！ 接着要去考其他想考的证书了，打算去考个潜水证，之前在小红书看到还有个潜水急救证，考这个证好像还得有急救证才可以去考，所以其实急救证还是很有用的！

I find it very meaningful to have a certificate - First Aid 
This is one of the most important skill certificates, besides my driver's license. 
Explanation: First Aid refers to the measures taken during a sudden event to provide emergency rescue before the ambulance arrives. 
It is well known that the process of waiting for the ambulance after an accident can take some time, and it is during this time that the most critical moment is. 
This is the time when first aid is needed. 
If I were to have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory failure, my window of life would only be four minutes, the "golden four minutes"! 
Therefore, it is very important for those around me to know first aid. 
When someone collapses, we can use our specialized knowledge to perform first aid, rather than standing there helplessly, which can be a very terrifying feeling. 
"In China, official data shows that there are 300,000 unexpected deaths every year, the most dangerous being heart attack. In the United States, the average is 15% able to be rescued. In Las Vegas's casino hotel, 78% can be rescued, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%. This is the first reaction from the founder, Luo Le." 
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing, there is no use in squeezing their chest. It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression to save their life. 
I found that not many people have this awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation arises, it is too late. Therefore, it is still necessary to encourage everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response in the face of sudden events. 
It is possible to save someone's life! 
The First Aid certificate can be signed up for at the Red Cross training center in your local area. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Pearl River, and there is also a discount for students. 
PS: The last picture is a record of my goal to complete before I turned 25, and adding the First Aid certificate to the goal list was also done a few months ago, but it was indeed completed! 
I will continue to sign up for other certificates I want to take, and I believe that the First Aid certificate is still very useful.

 [/INST] Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship Model for Talent Cultivation - Xinhua News Agency 

Yesterday, a reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, Chongqing will pilot the "modern apprenticeship model" for talent cultivation in 60 vocational schools. Students who participate in the pilot program will simultaneously possess apprentice status, and after being recruited and enrolled, they will be pre-registered as employees of the pilot enterprises. 

The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment processes of vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise employees be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and for students who are not yet 18 years old, all parties must sign a four-party agreement to determine each party's rights and the specific job positions, teaching content, and rights protection for apprentices in the workplace. 

It is encouraged that pilot schools adopt the modern apprenticeship model in cooperation with partner enterprises to conduct enterprise employee pre-training and transfer training. 

Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation model. The school and enterprise should jointly design the talent cultivation plan, jointly establish the professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans. 

Pilot schools should use the apprenticeship model as a trial period, and students' internship time should be determined based on the talent cultivation plan. The top-level internship generally lasts for 6 months. In the enterprise practice, it is necessary to implement the enterprise team management model, and according to the characteristics of different professions, one master can supervise 2 to 5 apprentices, forming a learning group, to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation post. 

According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, Chongqing will determine three batches of 60 pilot vocational schools, with each batch having about 50 students, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. According to the principle of first trial and then promotion, the pilot should be implemented step by step, and the mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment and training should be explored to build a long-term and effective mechanism for cultivating students' job skills, improving students' employment rate and quality.

 [/INST] This vacuum cleaner was considered for a long time before finally deciding to buy it. The suction effect is not bad, and the amount of dust in the house has significantly decreased. It feels a bit heavy to hold it with one hand, but it's worth it. The wet and dry cleaning modes need to be improved, and there may be some residue when switching back and forth. Overall, I am very satisfied with it.

The rice cooker is quite heavy and looks sturdy. It's perfect for my small kitchen, and my kids say it's better than the ones I make myself. I've made steamed pork and vegetables, and the honey-glazed pork ribs are especially delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but the other settings are very short, and the noise level is very low. There's no need to worry about burning or overcooking.

The vacuum cleaner arrived, and I couldn't wait to try it out at noon. It's amazing how technology has changed our lives. The temperature and seasoning control are precise, and the taste of the food is elevated to a professional level. It's a godsend for people who are not good at cooking. I highly recommend buying it!

I added a new member to my kitchen. It's an intelligent rice cooker that automatically adjusts the temperature and flips the rice. I'm no longer afraid of getting burnt by hot oil or controlling the temperature poorly, and the rice comes out even better. The tomato and egg omelette are especially delicious, and the egg taste is particularly good. This pot is great value for money.

The product is excellent, and it's worth buying. It's very clear, and it's consistent with the description. The customer service is also great. The screen is large and clear, and my eyes don't get tired. I haven't found any other issues yet, but the screen is a bit wider, and the gap between the screen and the frame is a bit larger. However, the screen display effect is good, and the accessories are complete.

The delivery speed is fast, and the seller's service attitude is good. I've been using it for a while now, and the quality is not bad. The screen resolution is also very clear. The fried rice is amazing, and it takes only 1 minute and 4 seconds to cook, which is perfect. The delivery is fast, the product is good, and it's the second time I've bought it. The display quality is high, and the screen size doesn't distort the image. The interface is complete.

Overall, it looks good, and the colors are accurate. The quality is excellent, and it's worth owning. The customer service is also great. I've been using it for a while now, and the quality is not bad. The screen resolution is also very clear.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症 南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。 据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。 该组织总监安本·皮莱（Unben Pillay）医生说，他每天都要看几十名病人，但是还没有任何病人需要住院。 皮莱说 ： “ 他们能够在家里控制疾病，大多数人在隔离10至14天内康复 。 ” 他说，这包括老年患者和那些有健康问题的患者，这些人群本来更容易因冠状病毒感染而陷入重症。 他说，与之相比，在上一波的德尔塔疫情中，他治疗的新冠患者“呼吸困难，血氧水平低。 许多人几天内就要住院 ” 。 在南部非洲首次报告奥密克戎变异毒株后的两周内，其他医生也分享了类似的经验。 虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。 据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。 非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ” 他还说 ： “ 现在还是早期，我们需要获得后期数据。 通常情况下，住院和死亡发生的时间较晚，而我们进入这一波疫情的时间只有两周 。 ” 与此同时，世界各地的科学家正在观察病例数和住院率，同时测试目前的疫苗和治疗方法的效果。 尽管德尔塔仍然是全世界主要的新冠病毒株，但奥密克戎病例正在数十个国家出现，其中南非为疫情中心。 据卫生官员介绍，豪登省在12月的第一周发现的新病例增加了400 % ， 测试显示，奥密克戎变体的病例占90%以上。

 [/INST] South African Doctors: Omicron Variant Transmission Powerful but Mild 

South African doctors and medical experts believe that the new coronavirus variant caused by Omicron is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are treating are generally mild, similar to those of the flu. The group's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees 40 to 50 patients a day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are at higher risk of developing severe disease. Pillay said that in comparison, in the previous Delta wave, the patients he treated had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many of them required hospitalization within a few days. In the two weeks since the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences. Although it takes several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, in the past few weeks, only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been severe, compared to half of the severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and the death rate among recent COVID-19 patients has been 3%, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa. Dr. Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying: "Currently, almost all evidence suggests that this is a mild disease." He also said: "We are still in the early stages, and we need to obtain long-term data. Typically, hospitalization and death occur later, and we entered this wave of the pandemic only two weeks ago." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Despite Delta remaining the dominant coronavirus variant globally, Omicron cases have been reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases in Gauteng province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for 90% or more of the cases.

From the perspective of ideals and mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leaders and party theory, Yang Haodong comprehensively and systematically explained the core meaning and practical requirements of the Plenum spirit through his own understanding and personal experience.

In the interactive exchange section, representatives from the grassroots, enterprises, and youth participated in discussions on the relationship between the three historical decisions, such as how to understand the decision-making significance of "two certainties," how cultural enterprises should grasp the guiding direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Communist Party. Yang Haodong answered each question with simple language and vivid examples, and he earnestly encouraged young party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Communist Party, to closely unite around the center of the Communist Party, and to remain steadfast in following the direction of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。 不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。 它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。 它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。 等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。 建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？ 对新手挺友好，但一过了新手阶段就鸡肋了，但大部分人，特别是女生，过不了新手阶段。

 [/INST] I want to try playing table tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to first find a cheap one to practice with. 

Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level paddles" are actually industrial trash. 

Their strength is very low, the ball bounces off the paddle surface, and the vibration is very large. The hard ball can't withstand it, and even high-level players find it difficult to control. 

The logic and hidden meaning behind them is that table tennis is so difficult, you know you won't be able to learn, and you also know you won't be able to afford the expensive ones, so you buy cheap ones to fool yourself, you play two games, and then you won't want to play again. This makes the paddle cheap, and you won't worry about it. 

Wait until you can tell the difference between good and bad, which means you've made progress, and then come back to buy the expensive ones. I'll make two times the profit. 

I suggest you spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand good paddle, choose Prince or Wilson, these two brands are not very famous, so the good paddle is difficult to sell at a high price, a new paddle for 500-600 yuan is good, and a second-hand paddle for 200 yuan is also good, isn't it enjoyable to have a paddle worth a thousand yuan? 

These paddles are quite friendly to beginners, but once you're past the beginner stage, you'll be sore. But most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。 身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。 裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。 过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。 如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。 其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。 穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。 如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。 越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。 以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。 对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。 微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。 当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。 胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。 短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔! 如果你是上身胖，但腿很瘦的MM，推荐选择华丽感的连衣短裙。 不但能遮住大肚皮，更能展现你的优点。 A字短裙会很显瘦，比较适合胖女孩，上衣要选择紧身一些的，形成层次感会更显瘦。 简简单单白T恤搭配短裙，胖MM也可以尝试。 微胖的女孩也是能够穿出时尚感的。 只要能够掌握好穿衣搭配的法则那么微胖的女孩子们也会是万众瞩目的焦点。 在穿衣搭配方面上有了改变后，在生活中也要多运动，争取早一天脱离微胖女生的标签吧😄

 [/INST] There are many rules to follow when it comes to fashion for overweight girls. The length of the skirt should be neither too short nor too long, with a difference of no more than a few inches from the knee. If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the bulging thighs. If it is too long, it will give the impression of being short and stout. If the skirt is divided into three sections, it will give the impression of being taller, with different colors for the top, skirt, and leggings. Black is a popular color for overweight girls, as it covers the bulging areas and gives a slimming effect. Black short skirts are also a favorite among overweight girls. Wearing black will make people think you're slimmer. If the thighs are very bulging, the leggings and shoes should not be too tight. The more popular, the better. The colors should not be too bright, as this will draw attention to the bulging areas and give the impression of being stout. For overweight girls, it is important to know the right fashion tips. Tight-fitting short skirts should be avoided, and the top should not be too short or too tight. If the thighs are bulging, it is recommended to wear black leggings or fishnet tights, with a soft and comfortable print on the skirt, and a V-neck top. This will effectively hide the bulging areas. Of course, overweight girls can also wear fashionable outfits. As long as they master the rules of fashion, they will be the focus of attention. After changing the fashion rules, it is also important to exercise more and strive to shed the label of being an overweight girl.

 [/INST] The maximum length of the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship in Guangxi has been extended to five years-Xinhua News Agency, South Nanning, May 19, 2021 (Reporter Zhang Nan) Recently, a reporter from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department learned that starting from now on, Guangxi universities will implement a flexible education system, relax the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship, and on the basis of the existing education system, the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship can be extended from two to five years, and the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time. To promote the enhancement of college students' entrepreneurship and innovation abilities, the Guangxi Education, Personnel and Social Welfare Departments collaborate to build entrepreneurship platforms, establish more college student extracurricular practice teaching bases, college science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external guarantees for college students' entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2022, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in each high school should be at least 30,000 square meters, and high vocational schools should be at least 20,000 square meters. The government encourages high schools to set up innovation and entrepreneurship courses, and prioritizes supporting students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to transfer majors. High school teachers should have at least two months of on-the-job training at industrial enterprises every two years to enhance their awareness and ability to innovate and engage in entrepreneurship in education. The Guangxi Education Department requires Guangxi universities to deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, and strive to ensure that every college student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school period. High schools should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

Seeing the wedding photo after it was taken, I realized that I was also "photoshopped."

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网 新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。 牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。 该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。 许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。 赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。 美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。 赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。 他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。 目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。 亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。 此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

On May 23rd, 2021, over 130 Chinese American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, accusing three well-known Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Duke University - of discriminating against Chinese American applicants during the recruitment process. The head of the Chinese American Education Association (CAEA) announced at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Chinese American applicants who meet the criteria for admission to Ivy League universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Chinese Americans in these three universities has remained relatively stable.

Numerous studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Chinese American applicants in the so-called "comprehensive evaluation" recruitment process. The CAEA introduced that according to research by Sedgwick et al. in 2014, the relative number of applicants and the acceptance rate of Chinese Americans in these three universities is the lowest among all ethnic groups. The US Department of Education's data also shows that in all Ivy League schools, Duke University and Brown University have the lowest acceptance rates for Chinese American students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota system for Chinese American applicants for over 20 years.

The CAEA hopes that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will conduct an investigation and take action to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Chinese Americans in recruitment. The CAEA also hopes that the three universities will actively address this issue and change their recruitment policies. As of now, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Chinese American Education Association was founded in 2015 and previously submitted a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating against Chinese American applicants, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of procedure. This time, in addition to Chinese American organizations, other organizations such as Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education organizations also participated in the complaint.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。 同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。 林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。” 然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。 考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。 好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。 为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。 法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。 一审判决后，原告提起上诉。 近日，二审法院维持原判。 【律师提醒】 在交易过程中要尽到必要的审慎注意义务。 在签订合同时，作为买方要尽到必要的审慎注意义务，比如，核实房屋所有权人信息、房屋是否被人占用等相关信息，并在合同中明确关于交付的具体时间、地点，以防履行合同时双方产生争议。

 [/INST] In September 2020, Mr. Luo discovered a factory located in Hangzhou Xiangyang Xiangqiang Town through a real estate agent. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Luo decided to purchase the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Luo negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Lin Some, and paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan through bank transfer. Lin Some signed the receipt of the deposit as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale, the payment method, and other major contract terms, the parties were unable to reach a consensus, and the contract was not signed. A few days later, Lin Some returned the deposit to Mr. Luo. Mr. Luo had finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment, but he was just waiting for "the last step" to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the factory, leaving Mr. Luo helpless and angry. For this reason, Mr. Luo sued Lin Some at the Hangzhou People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, determined that the parties ultimately could not sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to hold the defendant solely responsible for the breach of contract. Instead, it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, and the case should not be subject to the deposit penalty. After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.

[Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due caution. When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due caution, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by someone, and other relevant information, and clearly stipulate the specific delivery time and place in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.

红牌威士忌喝法是什么？ 每个人的爱好不同，有人喜欢收藏，有人喜欢美食，当然也有人喜欢品酒，红牌威士忌是目前各个国家最畅销的苏格兰威士忌之一，而且红牌威士忌曾获国际洋酒大赛金奖。 每一瓶红牌威士忌都有独特的味道，不过如果不知道如何品味它，岂不是糟蹋了它的醇香。 那么红牌威士忌怎么喝呢？ 小编为大家简单介绍下。 红牌威士忌喝法： 尊尼获加红牌威士忌由约35种苏格兰威士忌调配而成，具有浓郁芳香及传统苏格兰威士忌的特质，浓郁芳香中带有甘甜及烟熏香味。 入口浓醇清新，略带香草及浓烈的烟熏麦芽味道。 该酒可以直接加冰饮用，或者与最喜爱的饮品混合饮用。 红牌威士忌进入国内,为了适应国人的口味,红牌威士忌+可乐或雪碧或新奇士等气泡饮料成为一种经久不衰的时尚。 这些甜味的饮料，除了可以中和酸味,在视觉上能给人带来愉悦，加入饮料,起到冲淡酒味改变口感的效果。 红牌威士忌+切片柠檬+方糖(砂糖亦可),是最正宗、最传统的喝法. 正宗的红方威味道有些酸涩,加入糖可以中和其中的酸味,柠檬则会给酒带来清新的香味,当然,甜酸度可根据个人的口味爱好调配。 以上三种都是红牌威士忌的最好喝法，大家可以作为参考尝试下，希望小编的介绍可以帮助到大家。

 [/INST] What is the Red Label Whisky Drinking Law? 

Everyone has different tastes, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, some people like to drink whisky. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in many countries, and it has won the gold award in the International Whisky Competition. 

Each bottle of Red Label Whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you might ruin its aroma. So, how do you drink Red Label Whisky? 

Our editor will simply introduce it to you. 

Red Label Whisky Drinking Law: 

Red Label Whisky is made from a blend of 35 different Scottish whiskies, with a rich, complex aroma and the traditional taste of Scottish whisky. The aroma contains sweet and smoky flavors. 

When you take a sip, the alcohol is clear and refreshing, with a hint of grass and a strong, smoky malt flavor. Red Label Whisky can be drunk directly on ice or mixed with your favorite drink. 

Red Label Whisky entered China, and for the Chinese palate, Red Label Whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or Sprite Zero became a popular trend. These sweet drinks not only balance the acidity but also give a visual pleasure. Adding them to the drink changes the taste and mouthfeel of the whisky. 

The most traditional and authentic way to drink Red Label Whisky is with a slice of lemon and honey (honey can also be used). The honey adds a sweetness that balances the acidity of the whisky, while the lemon gives the whisky a fresh, clean aroma. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste. 

These three are the best ways to drink Red Label Whisky, and we hope our introduction can help you.

 [/INST] Golden Bride Wedding Photography (South Street Store) is currently not divided into branches. Due to our lack of time coordination, we had to change the time twice. Lan Lan, the consultant, was very patient and helped us arrange the time. We later chose a good weather weekend for photography. The staff of Golden Bride's work, including consultants, makeup artists, and photographers, are all very good. It was the first time in my life to have a formal makeup. Wow, I can hardly believe that one day I will become so beautiful. Lan Lan and another sister (I'm sorry I don't remember her name) did a great job with makeup and were very natural. The scenery was photographed in the city of Jiangwan. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and it wasn't too cold. The photographer was very funny, and we were all happy after taking photos for a whole day. During the selection of photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the customers delete too many photos, but we found that there was no intention of adding more photos when we were selecting them. There were 24 photos in the set, and not a single one was added. (I heard that the bride's sister who took photos with us on the same day took seven thousand yuan in the set and added one hundred thousand yuan in photos. I was stunned at the time, and my heart was also very scared that I would choose too many.) Today, the photos have been retouched, and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at them and found that there were two that didn't look good. They immediately helped me re-retouch them. I compared the photos my sister took before with ours, and I found that our photos were truly very satisfying. Simple and clean, just what I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Golden Bride's wedding photography! The set price is 3999 yuan. Golden Bride thanks you for your sincere wishes for our happiness and prosperity, and we look forward to a bright future! How much does this set cost?

你叫郑眠，这是你搬来日本的第二周。 你走在街上，突然发现有人跟着你，你害怕地越走越快，最后跑了起来。 那人在你身后追：“小姐！请等等！”（全程日文对话） 你在便利店门口停下了脚步。 “小姐……我是一名导演，我看你长得很美，有兴趣参加真人秀吗？” 你很疑惑，害怕这是骗局。 他塞给你一张名片，你发现他真的是日本一家大型娱乐公司的导演。 “小姐如果有时间的话，我们可以去公司里谈，片酬一定少不了。” 你稀里糊涂就跟他来到了公司，他说他一眼就在街上看见了你，非常希望你能来参加。 你想着没什么损失，还能赚钱，就签下了合同。 这是一个大型恋爱真人秀，分为两部分。 前期会让明星和素人在现实生活中相处，培养默契。 后期则会进入到游戏中共同闯关。 下周就要开始正式录制了，你并不知道自己的搭档会是谁，会有什么有趣的事情发生呢？

I am a director. I saw you and thought you were very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You were very confused and scared that this was a scam. He gave you a business card, and you found out that he was actually the director of a large Japanese entertainment company. "Small girl, if you have time, we can talk at the company. The fee will definitely be less than expected." You were hesitant but decided to follow him to the company. He said he saw you on the street and was very happy that you were interested in participating. You thought there was no loss, and you could still earn money, so you signed the contract. This is a large-scale love reality show, divided into two parts. The first part will have celebrities and non-celebrities living together in real life and cultivating mutual understanding. The second part will enter the game together. Next week, the formal recording will start, and you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货 （亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。 不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。 他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。 他说，有关问题在2个月前就出现，砂拉越也面对同样的问题。 “其中一个原因是生产特制防伪纸的中国厂家受疫情影响，导致延迟运抵我国 。 ” 他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。 凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。 “该局下周四将派人到吉隆坡取货，回到沙巴立刻进行最后阶段的打印，估计多2个工作日（12月20日）就可以交到申请者手上 。 ” “我们会通知申请者前往各地分局领取报生纸 。 ” 他补充，沙巴今年至今共发出2万4801张报生纸。

油管视频起底美军20年嗜血杀戮真相-新华网 （视频来源：油管） 12月11日，油管平台一条名为《杀戮机器》的微纪录片引起广泛关注。 该片讲述了美国以“反恐”为名发动阿富汗战争，通过战争强行输出美式民主，20年穷兵黩武、嗜血成性、滥杀无辜，犯下种种反人类罪行。 滥用无人机空袭医院、学校等民用场所，扭曲人性，成立杀人小组。 20年来，美军杀害了数万阿富汗无辜平民。 美军设“黑狱”对“嫌犯”施加种种酷刑、人身羞辱。 一桩桩反人类罪行激起更多阿富汗人的仇恨。 正如视频所说，美式“反恐”战争“越反越恐 ” 。 战争没有给阿富汗人民带去和平民主、繁荣希望，带去的只有满目疮痍的国家和无数的杀戮破坏。 戳视频，让我们一起来揭穿美国以“反恐”为名，嗜血杀戮的真相，戳穿美式民主的虚伪假面！

 [/INST] The Truth Behind 20 Years of Bloodthirsty Killing by the US Military in Afghanistan - Xinhua News Agency （Video Source: YouTube） 

On December 11th, a video titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention. The video tells the story of the United States launching a war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "counterterrorism," forcibly exporting American democracy, and engaging in 20 years of brutal and bloodthirsty killing, committing various human rights atrocities. 

The video shows how the US military used drones to indiscriminately bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, distorting human nature, and establishing death squads. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghans. 

The video also shows how the US military set up "black prisons" to torture "suspects" with various forms of torture and humiliation. This further inflamed the hatred of the Afghan people. 

As the video states, the US "counterterrorism" war has become more and more brutal and terrifying. The war has not brought peace and democracy to the Afghan people, but only a country full of wounds and countless acts of violence. 

Click on the video to uncover the truth behind the US's use of "counterterrorism" as a pretext for its bloodthirsty killing spree, and to expose the hypocrisy of American democracy.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网 逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。 现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。 等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。 正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。 这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。 因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。 对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。 绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。 马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。 “最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。 或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。 “次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。 总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。 由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。 只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。 总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

Today's successful study books are often promoted with "best principles" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do "is what." This is equivalent to saying that you have already passed the "how to do it" step, which is actually the most important and fundamental step. Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either they encourage you to persistently strive for the best or they encourage you to do nothing at all; either it's 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai or simply stay in your original place. This "best principles" encourages people to believe that it is "perfectly right," but 99% of people will be scared away by the starting line. This is because this theory promotes a path that encourages people to "renew their determination, change their ways, and make a 180-degree turn," which is actually many people's fatal weakness. For people who are used to following rules, being consistent, and rejecting change, you should loudly shout "you need to change" in their ear, which is obviously self-deception and mockery. Most people will be scared away by the words "change" before they even take a step, and they will be hesitant to make a decision; or they will make a decision based on temporary impulse and then courageously take the first step, but the good scene will not last long, and they will give up after a while, and it will be difficult to see sustainability. Ma Xiangshan's famous section of "From Tomorrow Onwards" in the crosstalk is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with "best principles" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making most people "envious of the door." Maybe "second-best principles" is a kind of path that can make more ordinary people walk on the road to relative success. The core of "second-best principles" is "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "small victories lead to big victories," which means that if you can't do 100, doing 1 is enough: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your front door is enough: because that's still better than staying in your original place. In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing anything. Due to the lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persisting has increased, and the probability of success has also increased. However, following the "second-best principles" success path is a little longer, but it's worth it. In summary, "best principles" may have a flag that inspires everyone to success on the surface, but in reality, it can only inspire a few; while "second-best principles" can effectively inspire more people and bring more benefits to more people.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网 新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。 青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。 20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。 2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。 从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。 与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。 青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。 青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。 为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。

 [/INST] According to the latest monitoring results, the amount of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources has increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is a 40-fold increase compared to the initial protection period in 2002. Qinghai Lake sturgeon, also known as "Tangyu," is a rare and valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the "water-fish-bird" food chain in the Qinghai Lake ecosystem. In the 1960s and 1970s, the decline in Qinghai Lake sturgeon population was influenced by various factors such as overfishing and environmental degradation of the breeding grounds. By 2002, the Qinghai Lake sturgeon resource reserve was only 2592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake sturgeon was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species." Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of covering the lake and breeding fish, prohibiting any organization, group, or individual from catching sturgeon in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of sturgeon and its products. At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, as well as the cleaning of Qinghai Lake's major rivers and tributaries and the design of scientifically reasonable "passage channels," the protection level has been continuously increased, and the Qinghai Lake sturgeon resource reserve has increased year by year. Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Commission, stated that as of now, Qinghai Lake sturgeon has been artificially bred and released near 1.8 billion tails, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the recovery of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources. Qinghai Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the westward expansion of arid and semi-arid areas towards the east. To protect the Three Rivers Source Area and Qinghai Lake water domain ecological environment, protect water wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, China has issued long-term fishing prohibition notices for key water domains such as the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year. This has established a comprehensive fishing prohibition management system for "one river, one river, one lake."

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？ 选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。 随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。 在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。 “在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!” 李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。 李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。 李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。 后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。 因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。 但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。 因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。 水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。 同时你可以随便拿电笔测。

 [/INST] Is it safe to use an electric foot spa? Choosing the right foot spa can be very beneficial for foot health. Today, we will answer this question and hope it helps our friends. With the increasing awareness of health, electric foot spas are becoming more popular among consumers. In the market, there are many different types of foot spas available, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. This gives consumers a lot of choices. According to relevant data, sales of electric foot spas and other health-related household appliances have been booming, but there are no specific industry standards for electric foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. "Dipping your feet in electricity is too dangerous, isn't it?" Li said to the reporter. Recently, he bought an electric foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father used it, he felt his feet going numb. Li first thought it was the vibration function of the foot spa that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet going numb. Li used an electric pen to test it, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. After contacting the seller, the seller's attitude was not bad, but Li still felt uncomfortable after returning the foot spa. Because he found that this popular foot spa did not have any clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the highest temperature setting, the target audience, and the materials used to ensure safety. However, in general, electric foot spas are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have issues during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a foot spa with a modular design. Water and electricity separation, no safety risks. At the same time, you can test it with an electric pen.

Thank you for your comments on our photography studio! We are still in the process of setting up shop, but we are excited to hear your thoughts on our work.

Regarding the photo shoot, we were pleased with the overall result. The two-person outfit looked great, and we really liked the pictures.

As for the service, we were very satisfied with the attention to detail. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate, making sure we were comfortable throughout the process. They even gave us hot water to drink and helped us relax while they worked. The price for the session was 1000 yuan, which we felt was reasonable for the quality of work we received.

We appreciate your positive feedback, and we are thrilled to hear that our work exceeded your expectations. We hope to continue to improve and provide even better service in the future.

Our photography studio is truly amazing, and we highly recommend it to all of our friends. From the reception desk to the makeup, clothing, lighting, and photography, every aspect of our work is top-notch. Our makeup artist is particularly skilled, and they take the time to understand each customer's style and preferences to create the perfect look. Our photographer is also highly professional, and their work speaks for itself.

The entire studio has a creative and artistic atmosphere, and we even have two adorable cats to keep us company. We are based in Beijing, and many of the best studios in the city require advance reservations of several months. We have friends who have had positive experiences at other studios, but we were particularly drawn to this one because of its unique spirit and attitude.

Our team is made up of talented and creative individuals who are dedicated to providing the best possible experience for our customers. We are thrilled to hear that our work has been well-received, and we hope to continue to grow and improve in the future.

Thank you for your kind words, and we look forward to the opportunity to work with you again in the future.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。 如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。 但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。 要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。 当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。 首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。 其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。 你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。 比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。 如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。 但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。 另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。 如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。 而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。 以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

 [/INST] Hello, I'm a beginner programmer who wants to share my personal experience. If you're planning to enter the industry, it's a good idea to find a training program. However, if you don't have any specific ideas, it's best to self-study. Training can be expensive and time-consuming, requiring 6 months of study. But if you're determined to enter the industry, training can be a great choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.

Choosing a good training institution is crucial. First, you need to consider the strength of the instructor's qualifications. If the instructor's qualifications are not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. However, some new training institutions may not have very strong instructor qualifications. Second, before making a decision, it's a good idea to explore the training institution and its students. Only the students of the institution can truly tell you how good or bad the institution is, and what courses are good or bad.

I'm sorry, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have enough information about your specific situation. Factors such as major, age, language, and location can all affect your learning or desired career path. If you're a student and still haven't graduated, or if you're a computer science graduate, self-study may be the most efficient and cost-effective option. Many online and offline training institutions are now very good, but they can be expensive and require a significant investment of time. However, if you're in my situation, self-study is very convenient. Many online learning resources are now free, or you can find them on Bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed advice.

Additionally, some classic books can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning. If you're not a computer science major but can afford to pay for learning expenses and time, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without having to spend too much effort, the teacher's explanations are detailed, and there are people available to answer questions. Moreover, many training institutions now sign job placement agreements, have internal recommendations, and can help you find work after you graduate, which can save you a lot of time during the job search process.

In summary, this is my opinion. Since I don't know your specific situation, I can only provide a general overview. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me for further discussion.

Just follow me, and thank those who silently praise me. Life is like this. People only see the results, but we must carry on by ourselves. We can look back at the past, but we cannot go back.

Cleaning is work, and it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of sincerity.

Every business is tough right now. But I believe that as long as we have a sincere attitude, perseverance, and hard work, we will be better than others, at least a little bit.

I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and good fortune with you as you start a new day. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning! Happiness is a thing, and having it is happiness. When we grow up, happiness is a goal, and achieving it is happiness. When we grow old, happiness is a state of mind, and understanding it is happiness. Be the best version of yourself, and do it with sincerity. Follow your heart, and don't regret anything in this life. Life is a journey, and we must walk our own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a happy mind. We must treasure them both and live a bright and lively life until we are old.

Each stage of life brings its own challenges. Often, it is not our abilities that bind us, but our willingness to face them bravely. Since we cannot avoid them, let's face them bravely. The more afraid we are, the more likely we are to be knocked down by difficulties. But if we face them bravely, the problems will solve themselves.

 [/INST] The First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition of Saudi Arabia Opens - Xinhua News Agency 12/12/2021 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Qiang) The First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition of Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency 12/12/2021 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Qiang)

The First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition of Saudi Arabia opened on November 11 at the JAX Art Zone in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other countries participated in the exhibition. The exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Binladin Group and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. The director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China, Tian Hao Yu, served as the art director. According to the organizers, the theme of the exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as the current development situation of Saudi Arabian society. The exhibition occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and consists of six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Facing the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art." Among them, 27 Saudi Arabian artists' works account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation art, and performance art, among others. Similarly, 12 Chinese artists' works are also attracting attention, with some artists using recycled materials to create art in a new way, such as Xu Bing in the "Behind the Scenes Series: The Endless Mountains" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials. According to the Saudi Binladin Group, the goal of the exhibition is to establish international dialogue and provide global audiences with an opportunity to understand the rapidly developing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, as well as to strengthen mutual communication. Tian Hao Yu said, "The goal of the exhibition is double-folded: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world." It is reported that during the opening period of the exhibition, a series of lectures will also be held, with artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry discussing topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

 [/INST] Yunnan: Standardized Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Yunnan Province, December 12, 2021 (Reporter Lin Baiqiang)

To promote the continuous employment of impoverished people and consolidate the expansion of poverty alleviation achievements, Yunnan Province recently issued a series of policies related to the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, in order to comprehensively promote the revitalization of rural areas. The Yunnan Provincial People's Social Welfare Bureau introduced related responsible persons, stating that as of now, Yunnan Province has developed 44,830 public welfare positions, which are used to employ impoverished labor force and other difficult groups in rural areas, and play an important role in helping impoverished groups achieve employment increase, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the public service ability of various items in rural areas.

This new rule was jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial People's Social Welfare Bureau, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments. The main objective of the rule is to standardize the recruitment of personnel for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions, etc.

In the development of positions, the new rule clarifies that according to the principles of "on-demand positioning, personnel positioning, dynamic management, total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person, one post, self-disclosure, and unified management," the positions should be set up. The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-training, and on-the-job training.

In addition, the new rule also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for public welfare positions, and the requirement that each public welfare position development department should purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position employees. It is also required that relevant departments should regularly monitor the payment of subsidies for public welfare positions.

今天来看一些【奇怪的热搜】。 什么是正常的舆情？ 随机挑选三个热搜：二月二龙抬头、好丽友涨价、货拉拉事件，舆情扩散形成波峰，然后【指数下降】（平滑曲线）最终消散，如果产生次生舆情会有小驼峰再次出现。 它们看起来和网信办官网曾展示的【网络舆情演化模型】相差无二。 什么是异常的舆情？ 随机挑选同一事件中的六个热搜，呈现出【孤峰状】、【锯齿状】、【断崖状】。 【孤峰状】即人为加热，迅速冲榜热搜，引起大众关注；【锯齿状】即周期性加热，确保话题盘踞热搜榜单；【断崖状】即集体撤离，该热搜发挥完“功能”，接到新任务、冲向新战场。 图9中，一个事件的热度波峰恰好是另一事件的波谷，时间分秒不差，必定是统一批水军接到任务，开启新一轮攻势。 黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。 传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。 凡走过必留下痕迹，这样的痕迹，我们一起挖出来。 数据来源：热搜时光机。

 [/INST] Today let's take a look at some [weird trending topics]. What is normal public opinion? Let's randomly select three trending topics: "February 2nd Dragon Head," "Beautiful Friendship Price Rise," and "Hualala Event," and the public opinion will form a peak, then it will have an exponential decline (smooth curve) and eventually dissipate. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small peak again. They look different from the network public opinion evolution model displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration. What is abnormal public opinion? Let's randomly select six trending topics related to the same event and present them in a [peak-trough-cliff] pattern. A [peak-trough-cliff] pattern means that a topic quickly rises to the top of the search rankings and attracts public attention; a [tooth-like pattern] means that a topic is periodically heated up, ensuring that it stays on the hot search rankings; a [cliff pattern] means that a topic is abandoned, and its function is exhausted, and it is replaced by a new task or a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of a topic's heat wave is exactly the trough of another topic's heat wave, with no time difference, which means that a unified batch of water troops has been assigned to the task, and a new round of attack has been launched. The professionalization of black PR can be seen everywhere: dozens of trending topics appear at the same time, which topics attract attention, which ones are responsible for explaining, which ones stir up controversy, which ones change direction, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, and which ones manipulate decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and they are precisely targeted at all elements of public opinion dissemination. Propagation is a science, which ignores subjective factors such as stance and emotion, and only looks at objective data, black PR will also have no place to hide. Any traces left behind will be indelible, and we will dig them out together. The source of data: hot search time machine.

毛里求斯等国首次发现奥密克戎毒株感染病例-新华网 新华社北京12月12日电 综合新华社驻外记者报道：毛里求斯、塞浦路斯和马拉维近日首次报告发现新冠变异病毒奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 毛里求斯10日首次报告该国两例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 据毛卫生部长凯莱什·贾古特帕尔介绍，一名感染者为自南非出发于11月27日抵达毛里求斯的游客；另一名感染者为毛里求斯本地居民，他与一名近期曾前往南非后返回的人员接触后，于11月30日核酸检测呈阳性。 经医院隔离治疗后，这两名感染者核酸检测结果均转为阴性，目前已返回各自的居住地。 塞浦路斯卫生部10日宣布该国首次确诊3例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 这3人都是学生，本月初从国外旅行回来，由于均为轻症，并未入院治疗。 为防范奥密克戎毒株蔓延，塞政府不断加大防控力度。 从12月6日到明年1月10日，乘飞机入境的12岁以上旅客抵塞后都需自费在机场接受核酸检测。 塞卫生部10日还宣布，将开始为该国5岁至11岁的儿童接种辉瑞新冠疫苗。 马拉维卫生部长昆比泽·奇蓬达9日说，该国首次发现3例奥密克戎毒株感染病例。 该国卫生部门对从11月9日至12月2日采集的12个新冠阳性样本开展基因组测序，发现了这3例感染病例。

 [/INST] The first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus have been reported in Mauritius, Seychelles, and Malawi. In Mauritius, the first two cases were reported on December 10th, involving a tourist who arrived from South Africa on November 27th and a local resident who came into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa on November 30th. After being hospitalized and treated, both individuals tested negative for the virus on December 1st. They have since returned to their respective homes. On December 10th, the Seychelles Ministry of Health announced the country's first three cases of Omicron infection, all of which were students who had traveled from China in early November and were experiencing mild symptoms. To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Seychelles government has increased its control measures. From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers arriving by plane aged 12 and above will be required to undergo a self-funded nucleic acid test at the airport. The Seychelles Ministry of Health also announced on December 10th that it would begin administering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 in the country. On November 9th, the Malawi Ministry of Health announced the country's first three cases of Omicron infection, all of which were detected through gene sequencing of samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd.

从以前到现在，我都反对任何形式的污蔑和谩骂，更不能接受这类人身攻击的行为。 在文明社会，我们可以包容一切，但就是要杜绝这种恶棍。 如果不看政党和派系，要先抵制的，就是这种不文明的作风。 从你开始发来脸书加好友请求开始，进而发表具调侃性的帖子，再到你试图把所谓我的家地点和父亲名字发布在社交媒体上，我都已经采取不回应的态度。 你过后变本加厉地不只按一日六餐的频率持续tag我，更在脸书跟你的所谓朋友们继续肆无忌惮地讨论着关于我一些隐晦、羞辱的言论，样貌、身材、好生养、又什么床上种草莓、要不要插之类的留言，我...也算了。 怎知后来我更收到多位朋友发来有关你的脸书朋友户口上载一张你的照片和具性骚扰成分的言论。 抱歉，作为一位女生，我再也无法继续沉默了。 我报警的新闻上载后，你完全没有收敛，反而更越发嚣张。 我不理你是什么政治背景，也不管你是什么身份地位，在我们的社会，是需要两性尊重的。 是的，你们可以继续这种具调侃性、隐晦、羞辱、辱骂的言论，你也可以继续说你只是关爱和关注我，你可以继续认为这并不是骚扰、你甚至可以继续否认那不是你制的图或者继续发表一切攻击性言论。 没错，我不能，也没有能力阻止你们。 我既不认识你，也不想认识你，我的样貌和身材更不需要你评头论足。 我甚至不认为会有哪一位女生愿意让别人如此地羞辱自己来换来出名。 朋友问我，还好吗？ 我说好，你也不会信。 我觉得不会有任何一位女生被如此霸凌后还可以说自己还好。 无论在工作、社会、政坛或商界，只有那些连基本品德都没有的人，才会选择用这种方式来伤害任何一位女性。 我相信，公道自在人心。 我截了部分留言给大家评理 你自己发的贴应该没有人可以冒充你了吧 我只能说你是文明的公敌 会心一笑

 [/INST] From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such behavior. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must reject this kind of evil. If you don't look at the political party and faction, the first thing to resist should be this kind of uncivilized behavior. From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests and posting offensive posts, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude. You continued to tag me at a frequency of one post per day, and in your Facebook conversations with your so-called friends, you continued to make obscene and insulting comments about me, such as my appearance, body shape, health, and bedding, and so on. I... I can't take it anymore. How do I know that later, many of my friends will post photos of you on their Facebook accounts and post offensive comments about you? I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news was posted, you didn't calm down, but instead became even more boisterous. In our society, respect for women is needed. Yes, you can continue to make offensive, obscene, insulting, and derogatory comments, and you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, and you can continue to deny that it's you who made the photo or continue to post offensive comments. There's no doubt about it. I can't and don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need your evaluation. I even don't believe there's any woman who would willingly let herself be humiliated like this in exchange for fame. My friend asked me, are you okay? I said yes, you won't believe me. I think no woman can be humiliated like this and still say she's okay. No matter in work, society, politics, or business, only those who lack basic morals will choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice is in the heart. I cut off some of your comments and gave them to everyone for review. Your own posts should be hard to imitate, right? I can only say that you are a civilized enemy, with a heart of gold.

 [/INST] The High-Speed Train Home 

Address: High-Speed North Road 555 Number 

Check the map 

This home is quite complete, with many brands and well-known brands. 

On December 12th, go to the "Hansen" water purifier store and check the water purifiers. The store is currently doing activities, and the prices are quite favorable. 

The home has 11 floors, and the negative second floor to the negative ninth floor are all parking areas, and the white day is free! 

The surrounding area is not very good. There are few restaurants and shops nearby, and the restaurant taste is generally poor. 

This elevator is also very strange. It looks like it has a big disease, and the negative second floor to the negative first floor are all going back and forth, and I can't stop pressing this layer. From the safe passage down to the first floor, it's also very strange, and it's directly connected to a furniture store. The furniture store door is locked, and the safe passage can't go out! 

The home still needs to be improved, and there are many places that haven't been developed. 

Address: Sandibak District, High-Speed North Road 555 Number, Convenient transportation, large parking lot, and white day is still free. 

Environment: To be honest, the store is quite large, with 8-9 floors, and there are many things you want to buy, such as furniture, household appliances, various small items... All can be bought here, and many well-known brands have entered the store. Taoist, Euclid, Huai Di, Laoban, Feng Cai, Hansen, Yak, Friendship, Silk, Rich Home, Wanjiale, Dashanren, Zhonglian, Meidi, Yadan... The brands are really too many, I can only remember so much, it's a good place to buy products, and it's tiring to walk around, you can sit on the sofa and rest. 

Recently, I want to buy a comfortable sofa, my friend said there are many comfortable sofas here, I looked at the High-Speed Train Home and Meidi Meijia, and I feel it's still okay, just the price is a little high, so I'm still thinking about it. 

The High-Speed Train Home Channel on Dianping provides the latest information on the merchant, address, phone, and business hours for you. Find a decoration company, just go to Dianping.

 [/INST] The Longjiang Dry Dock Realizes Full Coverage of the Green Comprehensive Service Zone on Water - Xinhua News Agency Wuhan 12/11/2021 (Reporter Wang Jing) The Longjiang Dry Dock in Chongqing was successfully completed and put into operation on the 10th, following the successful operation of the Longjiang Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan Province on the 8th. This marks the second Longjiang Green Comprehensive Service Zone in the upstream of the Longjiang River to be put into operation. As of now, Green Comprehensive Service Zones have been established and put into operation in the upstream, middle, and downstream of the Longjiang River in various provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The Deputy Director of the Transportation and Communications Department of the Longjiang Navigation Management Bureau, Xu Jianhui, introduced that before this, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already established and put into operation 10 Green Comprehensive Service Zones in the upstream, middle, and downstream of the Longjiang River, which have been widely recognized by ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Longjiang navigation. The full coverage of Green Comprehensive Service Zones is another milestone event in the construction of Longjiang Green Navigation. The reception of Longjiang River pollution materials and the navigation service capability have been significantly improved. According to the introduction, the Green Comprehensive Service Zone is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for large ships and ship crews, helping large ship crews solve the "urgent difficulty and anxiety" problem. This time, two Green Comprehensive Service Zones have been successfully built and put into operation in the upstream of the Longjiang River, integrating life services, production services, and political services into one body, with the theme of green environmental protection, and with ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as special features, realizing the "one-time docking, multiple services" for ships in the harbor. This will make the work of common ship crews in the Longjiang River more efficient and their living conditions more convenient.

中越两军“和平救援-2021”卫勤联合演习圆满结束-新华网 新华社河内12月12日电（周娜 滕怀金）12日上午，参加中越两军“和平救援-2021”卫勤联合演习的中方参演分队全部安全返回中国广西境内，标志着此次持续7天的演训任务顺利完成。 此次联演，中越两军围绕人道主义医学救援这一重大课题，紧扣卫勤救死扶伤使命任务，按照实战化标准完成了联合卫勤指挥、联合现场救援、批量伤员处置等课目内容，有效提升了两军卫勤保障能力。 演习成果得到中越两军的肯定。 越方演习指导委员会主任、越南人民军后勤总局副主任兼参谋长阮雄胜在演习结束仪式上说，通过此次演习，越南军医从中国军医身上学到了演习组织及专业活动方面的知识，也见识了中方的医疗、保障设备。 演习取得的成果证明了两国军医力量在医疗援助、疫情防控方面的专业能力。 中方指导协调组组长、中央军委后勤保障部卫生局副局长陈春明表示，此次演习是在2018年成功举办联合义诊活动的基础上又一次开拓创新实践，具有非常重要的里程碑意义。 演习期间，中国人民解放军向越南人民军捐赠了医用防护口罩、医用防护服、快速核酸检测仪器等卫生防疫物资。

 [/INST] The "Harmony Rescue-2021" Joint Exercise Between the Chinese and Yemeni Armies Ends Successfully-Xinhua News Agency 

On December 12th, the Chinese and Yemeni armies successfully completed the "Harmony Rescue-2021" Joint Exercise in China's Guangxi Province, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training task. This exercise focused on the major theme of humanitarian medical rescue, closely linked to the mission of the Yemeni Red Cross, and completed the joint Red Cross command, joint field rescue, and mass injury treatment according to the standards of real-world operations. This effectively improved the two armies' Red Cross protection capabilities. The results of the exercise were confirmed by the Chinese and Yemeni armies. 

Yemeni Army Exercise Leadership Committee Chairman and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Yemeni People's Liberation Army Medical Corps, Major General Amir Xiongsheng, spoke at the closing ceremony of the exercise, saying that through this exercise, the Yemeni Army Medical Corps learned about the organization and professional activities of the Chinese Army Medical Corps from the Chinese Army Medical Corps, and also saw the Chinese Army's medical and rescue equipment. The results of the exercise proved that the medical and rescue capabilities of the Chinese and Yemeni armies in medical assistance and disease prevention are at a professional level. 

Chinese Army Exercise Command and Coordination Group Leader and Deputy Director of the Central Military Commission's Logistics Support Department's Medical Corps, Lieutenant General Chen Chunming, said at the closing ceremony of the exercise that this exercise was based on the successful holding of the 2018 Joint Humanitarian Medical Activity, and was again expanded and innovated, with great importance. During the exercise, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective suits, and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the Yemeni People's Liberation Army for public health purposes.
