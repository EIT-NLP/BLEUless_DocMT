This document is a translation from Chinese to English.  I find it very meaningful to have a certificate - First Aid  This is one of the most important skill certificates, besides my driver's license.  Explanation: First Aid refers to the measures taken during a sudden event to provide emergency rescue before the ambulance arrives.  It is well known that the process of waiting for the ambulance after an accident can take some time, and it is during this time that the most critical moment is.  This is the time when first aid is needed.  If I were to have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory failure, my window of life would only be four minutes, the "golden four minutes"!  Therefore, it is very important for those around me to know first aid.  When someone collapses, we can use our specialized knowledge to perform first aid, rather than standing there helplessly, which can be a very terrifying feeling.  "In China, official data shows that there are 300,000 unexpected deaths every year, the most dangerous being heart attack. In the United States, the average is 15% able to be rescued. In Las Vegas's casino hotel, 78% can be rescued, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%. This is the first reaction from the founder, Luo Le."  If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing, there is no use in squeezing their chest. It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression to save their life.  I found that not many people have this awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation arises, it is too late. Therefore, it is still necessary to encourage everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response in the face of sudden events.  It is possible to save someone's life!  The First Aid certificate can be signed up for at the Red Cross training center in your local area. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Pearl River, and there is also a discount for students.  PS: The last picture is a record of my goal to complete before I turned 25, and adding the First Aid certificate to the goal list was also done a few months ago, but it was indeed completed!  I will continue to sign up for other certificates I want to take, and I believe that the First Aid certificate is still very useful.

Because I saw that the code I inputted before was valid.

Chongqing Vocational School Pilots Modern Apprenticeship Model for Talent Cultivation - Xinhua News Agency   Yesterday, a reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, Chongqing will pilot the "modern apprenticeship model" for talent cultivation in 60 vocational schools. Students who participate in the pilot program will simultaneously possess apprentice status, and after being recruited and enrolled, they will be pre-registered as employees of the pilot enterprises.   The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment processes of vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise employees be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and for students who are not yet 18 years old, all parties must sign a four-party agreement to determine each party's rights and the specific job positions, teaching content, and rights protection for apprentices in the workplace.   It is encouraged that pilot schools adopt the modern apprenticeship model in cooperation with partner enterprises to conduct enterprise employee pre-training and transfer training.   Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation model. The school and enterprise should jointly design the talent cultivation plan, jointly establish the professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.   Pilot schools should use the apprenticeship model as a trial period, and students' internship time should be determined based on the talent cultivation plan. The top-level internship generally lasts for 6 months. In the enterprise practice, it is necessary to implement the enterprise team management model, and according to the characteristics of different professions, one master can supervise 2 to 5 apprentices, forming a learning group, to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation post.   According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, Chongqing will determine three batches of 60 pilot vocational schools, with each batch having about 50 students, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. According to the principle of first trial and then promotion, the pilot should be implemented step by step, and the mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment and training should be explored to build a long-term and effective mechanism for cultivating students' job skills, improving students' employment rate and quality.

This vacuum cleaner was considered for a long time before finally deciding to buy it. The suction effect is not bad, and the amount of dust in the house has significantly decreased. It feels a bit heavy to hold it with one hand, but it's worth it. The wet and dry cleaning modes need to be improved, and there may be some residue when switching back and forth. Overall, I am very satisfied with it.  The rice cooker is quite heavy and looks sturdy. It's perfect for my small kitchen, and my kids say it's better than the ones I make myself. I've made steamed pork and vegetables, and the honey-glazed pork ribs are especially delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but the other settings are very short, and the noise level is very low. There's no need to worry about burning or overcooking.  The vacuum cleaner arrived, and I couldn't wait to try it out at noon. It's amazing how technology has changed our lives. The temperature and seasoning control are precise, and the taste of the food is elevated to a professional level. It's a godsend for people who are not good at cooking. I highly recommend buying it!  I added a new member to my kitchen. It's an intelligent rice cooker that automatically adjusts the temperature and flips the rice. I'm no longer afraid of getting burnt by hot oil or controlling the temperature poorly, and the rice comes out even better. The tomato and egg omelette are especially delicious, and the egg taste is particularly good. This pot is great value for money.  The product is excellent, and it's worth buying. It's very clear, and it's consistent with the description. The customer service is also great. The screen is large and clear, and my eyes don't get tired. I haven't found any other issues yet, but the screen is a bit wider, and the gap between the screen and the frame is a bit larger. However, the screen display effect is good, and the accessories are complete.  The delivery speed is fast, and the seller's service attitude is good. I've been using it for a while now, and the quality is not bad. The screen resolution is also very clear. The fried rice is amazing, and it takes only 1 minute and 4 seconds to cook, which is perfect. The delivery is fast, the product is good, and it's the second time I've bought it.

South African Doctors: Omicron Variant Transmission Powerful but Mild   South African doctors and medical experts believe that the new coronavirus variant caused by Omicron is less severe than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of 5,000 doctors in the province of Gauteng reported that the symptoms of the new coronavirus patients they are treating are generally mild, similar to those of the flu. The group's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees 40 to 50 patients a day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are at higher risk of developing severe disease. Pillay said that in comparison, in the previous Delta wave, the patients he treated had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many of them required hospitalization within a few days. In the two weeks since the first report of the Omicron variant in South Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences. Although it takes several weeks to collect enough data, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues. According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, in the past few weeks, only 30% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been severe, compared to half of the severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; and the death rate among recent COVID-19 patients has been 3%, compared to 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa. Dr. Willem Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying: "Currently, almost all evidence suggests that this is a mild disease." He also said: "We are still in the early stages, and we need to obtain long-term data. Typically, hospitalization and death occur later, and we entered this wave of the pandemic only two weeks ago." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing case numbers and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Despite Delta remaining the dominant coronavirus variant globally, Omicron cases have been reported in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases in Gauteng province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and tests showed that the Omicron variant accounted for 90% or more of the cases.

Yang Haodong gave a speech on the spirit of the 19th Plenum of the Sixth Central Conference and the 12th Hubei Provincial Party Congress, drawing strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Communist Party. On December 10th, according to the unified arrangement of the Hubei Provincial Committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the Hubei Provincial Committee and director of the Hubei Provincial Propaganda Department, gave an interactive speech at the Marble Mountain Video Art and Creativity Yard. From the perspective of ideals and mission, self-revolution and youth party, party leaders and party theory, Yang Haodong comprehensively and systematically explained the core meaning and practical requirements of the Plenum spirit through his own understanding and personal experience. He pointed out that the Plenum spirit should be combined with the important instructions of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, on important speeches in Hubei, and the spirit of the 12th Hubei Provincial Party Congress to study, integrate, and enhance the thinking of "two certainties" and "two maintenance" in a self-conscious, political, and action-conscious way. In the interactive exchange section, representatives from the grassroots, enterprises, and youth participated in discussions on the relationship between the three historical decisions, such as how to understand the decision-making significance of "two certainties," how cultural enterprises should grasp the guiding direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the hundred-year history of the Communist Party. Yang Haodong answered each question with simple language and vivid examples, and he earnestly encouraged young party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Communist Party, to closely unite around the center of the Communist Party, and to remain steadfast in following the direction of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China.

"In reality, I don't know if it's the store's error or the delivery person's error. There is no receipt on the bag, so it cannot be traced. I hope you understand a little."
Thank you, the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than shown.
Yes, we have changed a rider. He has been waiting for a long time. That restaurant has always said it is processing, and we have been waiting for several hours.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is constantly delayed.
The original plan was #NUMBER#, but in the end, I didn't go through with it.
"If you don't eat it, I will definitely complain that you couldn't send it on time. Why don't you tell me earlier so I don't have to wait for so long?"
"No, I haven't received the call. Please notify him to resend it to our company."
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
I waited for an hour at the restaurant, but my order hasn't been delivered yet. I want to cancel the order, but why won't you let me? #PRS_ORG#
Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is alive.
I want to try playing table tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to first find a cheap one to practice with.   Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level paddles" are actually industrial trash.   Their strength is very low, the ball bounces off the paddle surface, and the vibration is very large. The hard ball can't withstand it, and even high-level players find it difficult to control.   The logic and hidden meaning behind them is that table tennis is so difficult, you know you won't be able to learn, and you also know you won't be able to afford the expensive ones, so you buy cheap ones to fool yourself, you play two games, and then you won't want to play again. This makes the paddle cheap, and you won't worry about it.   Wait until you can tell the difference between good and bad, which means you've made progress, and then come back to buy the expensive ones. I'll make two times the profit.   I suggest you spend a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand good paddle, choose Prince or Wilson, these two brands are not very famous, so the good paddle is difficult to sell at a high price, a new paddle for 500-600 yuan is good, and a second-hand paddle for 200 yuan is also good, isn't it enjoyable to have a paddle worth a thousand yuan?   These paddles are quite friendly to beginners, but once you're past the beginner stage, you'll be sore. But most people, especially girls, can't get past the beginner stage.
The order delivery time has been delayed multiple times. Can you help me track it down? Thank you.
"Is it true that I already have credit?"
Do I need to place a new order? Did you ignore the previous order?

There are many rules to follow when it comes to fashion for overweight girls. The length of the skirt should be neither too short nor too long, with a difference of no more than a few inches from the knee. If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the bulging thighs. If it is too long, it will give the impression of being short and stout. If the skirt is divided into three sections, it will give the impression of being taller, with different colors for the top, skirt, and leggings. Black is a popular color for overweight girls, as it covers the bulging areas and gives a slimming effect. Black short skirts are also a favorite among overweight girls. Wearing black will make people think you're slimmer. If the thighs are very bulging, the leggings and shoes should not be too tight. The more popular, the better. The colors should not be too bright, as this will draw attention to the bulging areas and give the impression of being stout. For overweight girls, it is important to know the right fashion tips. Tight-fitting short skirts should be avoided, and the top should not be too short or too tight. If the thighs are bulging, it is recommended to wear black leggings or fishnet tights, with a soft and comfortable print on the skirt, and a V-neck top. This will effectively hide the bulging areas. Of course, overweight girls can also wear fashionable outfits. As long as they master the rules of fashion, they will be the focus of attention. After changing the fashion rules, it is also important to exercise more and strive to shed the label of being an overweight girl.

Yes, the order is in the accepted status. However, the restaurant called and said that the courier could not deliver bone-in meat, so the restaurant needs to cut the meat and discard the bone. Is this clear to you? This is not about the order being delayed or if you can directly call the restaurant. Is there anything else I can help you with?
The maximum length of the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship in Guangxi has been extended to five years-Xinhua News Agency, South Nanning, May 19, 2021 (Reporter Zhang Nan) Recently, a reporter from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department learned that starting from now on, Guangxi universities will implement a flexible education system, relax the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship, and on the basis of the existing education system, the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship can be extended from two to five years, and the vacation period for college students to engage in entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time. To promote the enhancement of college students' entrepreneurship and innovation abilities, the Guangxi Education, Personnel and Social Welfare Departments collaborate to build entrepreneurship platforms, establish more college student extracurricular practice teaching bases, college science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external guarantees for college students' entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2022, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in each high school should be at least 30,000 square meters, and high vocational schools should be at least 20,000 square meters. The government encourages high schools to set up innovation and entrepreneurship courses, and prioritizes supporting students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to transfer majors. High school teachers should have at least two months of on-the-job training at industrial enterprises every two years to enhance their awareness and ability to innovate and engage in entrepreneurship in education. The Guangxi Education Department requires Guangxi universities to deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, and strive to ensure that every college student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school period. High schools should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

The Full-View Wedding Photography Base (Hebei Store) has not yet opened branches. The wedding fashion and makeup artist is the first-rate one, and the photography technique and angle are called a professional. The photography effect is very good. The seller has a very good reputation, and the service attitude is also very good. The makeup is very precise, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very happy, and the team was very professional, and the seller's service attitude was very good. They will introduce it to their friends, and they are very satisfied. Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, who made me have a unique and unforgettable wedding photo. Thank you to all the staff who worked on the wedding photo today. We are looking forward to the release of the final product. Photographing a wedding photo is simply a physical activity, especially the photographer, who runs and jumps around. The makeup artist is very caring and helped me design a makeup that suits my face shape. The photographer's humor was very funny during the shooting, and it was worth praising. Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist, who can make me look beautiful even in my old age. Thank you to the beautiful bride, whose eyes are bright, and her face is big and beautiful, just like a good wife and mother. Thank you to the groom, who has earned his fortune, and his life is happy and beautiful. The quality of the wedding photo is indeed not bad, just as it is said on the internet, and my husband and I look very handsome and beautiful. We are very satisfied. The seller's service attitude is also very warm. This trip was not only enjoyed the scenery but also took beautiful wedding photos and made new friends with the photographer. The wedding photo is too beautiful, and it is worth praising the photographer and makeup artist, who are truly very professional. Thank you to Auntie Fan for her patience and careful guidance, and the photos she took are very beautiful. Seeing the wedding photo, I realized that I was "photoshopped" at that moment. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have a beautiful wedding photo like a star. Photographing a wedding photo is very important, and both the photographer and makeup artist need to have a good online aesthetic, which is fortunate for me. Seeing the wedding photo after it was taken, I realized that I was also "photoshopped."
Chinese to English Translation:  On May 23rd, 2021, over 130 Chinese American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, accusing three well-known Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Duke University - of discriminating against Chinese American applicants during the recruitment process. The head of the Chinese American Education Association (CAEA) announced at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Chinese American applicants who meet the criteria for admission to Ivy League universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Chinese Americans in these three universities has remained relatively stable.  Numerous studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Chinese American applicants in the so-called "comprehensive evaluation" recruitment process. The CAEA introduced that according to research by Sedgwick et al. in 2014, the relative number of applicants and the acceptance rate of Chinese Americans in these three universities is the lowest among all ethnic groups. The US Department of Education's data also shows that in all Ivy League schools, Duke University and Brown University have the lowest acceptance rates for Chinese American students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota system for Chinese American applicants for over 20 years.  The CAEA hopes that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will conduct an investigation and take action to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Chinese Americans in recruitment. The CAEA also hopes that the three universities will actively address this issue and change their recruitment policies. As of now, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Chinese American Education Association was founded in 2015 and previously submitted a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating against Chinese American applicants, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of procedure. This time, in addition to Chinese American organizations, other organizations such as Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education organizations also participated in the complaint.

In September 2020, Mr. Luo discovered a factory located in Hangzhou Xiangyang Xiangqiang Town through a real estate agent. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Luo decided to purchase the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Luo negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Lin Some, and paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan through bank transfer. Lin Some signed the receipt of the deposit as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. However, due to differences in the scope of the factory's sale, the payment method, and other major contract terms, the parties were unable to reach a consensus, and the contract was not signed. A few days later, Lin Some returned the deposit to Mr. Luo. Mr. Luo had finally found a house he liked, paid the deposit, and prepared the payment, but he was just waiting for "the last step" to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the factory, leaving Mr. Luo helpless and angry. For this reason, Mr. Luo sued Lin Some at the Hangzhou People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, determined that the parties ultimately could not sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to hold the defendant solely responsible for the breach of contract. Instead, it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiation failed, and the case should not be subject to the deposit penalty. After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.  [Legal Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due caution. When signing the contract, the buyer should exercise due caution, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by someone, and other relevant information, and clearly stipulate the specific delivery time and place in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.

What is the Red Label Whisky Drinking Law?   Everyone has different tastes, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, some people like to drink whisky. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in many countries, and it has won the gold award in the International Whisky Competition.   Each bottle of Red Label Whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, you might ruin its aroma. So, how do you drink Red Label Whisky?   Our editor will simply introduce it to you.   Red Label Whisky Drinking Law:   Red Label Whisky is made from a blend of 35 different Scottish whiskies, with a rich, complex aroma and the traditional taste of Scottish whisky. The aroma contains sweet and smoky flavors.   When you take a sip, the alcohol is clear and refreshing, with a hint of grass and a strong, smoky malt flavor. Red Label Whisky can be drunk directly on ice or mixed with your favorite drink.   Red Label Whisky entered China, and for the Chinese palate, Red Label Whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or Sprite Zero became a popular trend. These sweet drinks not only balance the acidity but also give a visual pleasure. Adding them to the drink changes the taste and mouthfeel of the whisky.   The most traditional and authentic way to drink Red Label Whisky is with a slice of lemon and honey (honey can also be used). The honey adds a sweetness that balances the acidity of the whisky, while the lemon gives the whisky a fresh, clean aroma. Of course, the sweetness and acidity can be adjusted according to personal taste.   These three are the best ways to drink Red Label Whisky, and we hope our introduction can help you.
If it is not possible to change my store location, can I opt for delivery instead?
No, I don't need to give you more money anymore.
The order of my colleague has been delivered. Why can't I see it on GPS yet? It hasn't arrived yet.
Golden Bride Wedding Photography (South Street Store) is currently not divided into branches. Due to our lack of time coordination, we had to change the time twice. Lan Lan, the consultant, was very patient and helped us arrange the time. We later chose a good weather weekend for photography. The staff of Golden Bride's work, including consultants, makeup artists, and photographers, are all very good. It was the first time in my life to have a formal makeup. Wow, I can hardly believe that one day I will become so beautiful. Lan Lan and another sister (I'm sorry I don't remember her name) did a great job with makeup and were very natural. The scenery was photographed in the city of Jiangwan. Fortunately, the weather was good that day, and it wasn't too cold. The photographer was very funny, and we were all happy after taking photos for a whole day. During the selection of photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the customers delete too many photos, but we found that there was no intention of adding more photos when we were selecting them. There were 24 photos in the set, and not a single one was added. (I heard that the bride's sister who took photos with us on the same day took seven thousand yuan in the set and added one hundred thousand yuan in photos. I was stunned at the time, and my heart was also very scared that I would choose too many.) Today, the photos have been retouched, and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at them and found that there were two that didn't look good. They immediately helped me re-retouch them. I compared the photos my sister took before with ours, and I found that our photos were truly very satisfying. Simple and clean, just what I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Golden Bride's wedding photography! The set price is 3999 yuan. Golden Bride thanks you for your sincere wishes for our happiness and prosperity, and we look forward to a bright future! How much does this set cost?

You are Zhang Meng, this is your second week in Japan. You were walking on the street when you suddenly felt someone following you. You were scared and ran faster and faster until you ran away. The person behind you shouted: "Small girl! Please wait!" (all in Japanese dialogue). You stopped at a convenience store. "Small girl... I am a director. I saw you and thought you were very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You were very confused and scared that this was a scam. He gave you a business card, and you found out that he was actually the director of a large Japanese entertainment company. "Small girl, if you have time, we can talk at the company. The fee will definitely be less than expected." You were hesitant but decided to follow him to the company. He said he saw you on the street and was very happy that you were interested in participating. You thought there was no loss, and you could still earn money, so you signed the contract. This is a large-scale love reality show, divided into two parts. The first part will have celebrities and non-celebrities living together in real life and cultivating mutual understanding. The second part will enter the game together. Next week, the formal recording will start, and you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货 （亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。 不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。 他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。 他说，有关问题在2个月前就出现，砂拉越也面对同样的问题。 “其中一个原因是生产特制防伪纸的中国厂家受疫情影响，导致延迟运抵我国 。 ” 他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。 凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉林坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。 “该局下周四将派人到吉林坡取货，回到沙巴立刻进行最后阶段的打印，估计多2个工作日（12月20日）就可以交到申请者手上 。 ” “我们会通知申请者前往各地分局领取报生纸 。 ” 他补充，沙巴今年至今共发出2万4801张报生纸。

The Truth Behind 20 Years of Bloodthirsty Killing by the US Military in Afghanistan - Xinhua News Agency （Video Source: YouTube）   On December 11th, a video titled "Killing Machine" on the YouTube platform attracted widespread attention. The video tells the story of the United States launching a war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "counterterrorism," forcibly exporting American democracy, and engaging in 20 years of brutal and bloodthirsty killing, committing various human rights atrocities.   The video shows how the US military used drones to indiscriminately bomb hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, distorting human nature, and establishing death squads. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghans.   The video also shows how the US military set up "black prisons" to torture "suspects" with various forms of torture and humiliation. This further inflamed the hatred of the Afghan people.   As the video states, the US "counterterrorism" war has become more and more brutal and terrifying. The war has not brought peace and democracy to the Afghan people, but only a country full of wounds and countless acts of violence.   Click on the video to uncover the truth behind the US's use of "counterterrorism" as a pretext for its bloodthirsty killing spree, and to expose the hypocrisy of American democracy.

Don't Scare People with Success Principles - Xinhua News Agency   When browsing bookstores, you can often feel the heat of successful study books. Today's successful study books are often promoted with "best principles" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do "is what." This is equivalent to saying that you have already passed the "how to do it" step, which is actually the most important and fundamental step. Because of this, these books all have a common feature - either they encourage you to persistently strive for the best or they encourage you to do nothing at all; either it's 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai or simply stay in your original place. This "best principles" encourages people to believe that it is "perfectly right," but 99% of people will be scared away by the starting line. This is because this theory promotes a path that encourages people to "renew their determination, change their ways, and make a 180-degree turn," which is actually many people's fatal weakness. For people who are used to following rules, being consistent, and rejecting change, you should loudly shout "you need to change" in their ear, which is obviously self-deception and mockery. Most people will be scared away by the words "change" before they even take a step, and they will be hesitant to make a decision; or they will make a decision based on temporary impulse and then courageously take the first step, but the good scene will not last long, and they will give up after a while, and it will be difficult to see sustainability. Ma Xiangshan's famous section of "From Tomorrow Onwards" in the crosstalk is the most classic expression of this "universal human nature." The biggest problem with "best principles" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making most people "envious of the door." Maybe "second-best principles" is a kind of path that can make more ordinary people walk on the road to relative success. The core of "second-best principles" is "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "small victories lead to big victories," which means that if you can't do 100, doing 1 is enough: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your front door is enough: because that's still better than staying in your original place. In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than not doing anything. Due to the lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persisting has increased, and the probability of success has also increased. However, following the "second-best principles" success path is a little longer, but it's worth it. In summary, "best principles" may have a flag that inspires everyone to success on the surface, but in reality, it can only inspire a few; while "second-best principles" can effectively inspire more people and bring more benefits to more people.
Do I need to place a new order now?

According to the latest monitoring results, the amount of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources has increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to the previous year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is a 40-fold increase compared to the initial protection period in 2002. Qinghai Lake sturgeon, also known as "Tangyu," is a rare and valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the "water-fish-bird" food chain in the Qinghai Lake ecosystem. In the 1960s and 1970s, the decline in Qinghai Lake sturgeon population was influenced by various factors such as overfishing and environmental degradation of the breeding grounds. By 2002, the Qinghai Lake sturgeon resource reserve was only 2592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake sturgeon was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species." Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of covering the lake and breeding fish, prohibiting any organization, group, or individual from catching sturgeon in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of sturgeon and its products. At the same time, through artificial breeding and release, as well as the cleaning of Qinghai Lake's major rivers and tributaries and the design of scientifically reasonable "passage channels," the protection level has been continuously increased, and the Qinghai Lake sturgeon resource reserve has increased year by year. Yang Lin, deputy director of the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Commission, stated that as of now, Qinghai Lake sturgeon has been artificially bred and released near 1.8 billion tails, accounting for more than 23% of the contribution to the recovery of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources. Qinghai Three Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the westward expansion of arid and semi-arid areas towards the east. To protect the Three Rivers Source Area and Qinghai Lake water domain ecological environment, protect water wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Plateau, China has issued long-term fishing prohibition notices for key water domains such as the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year.

Is it safe to use an electric foot spa? Choosing the right foot spa can be very beneficial for foot health. Today, we will answer this question and hope it helps our friends. With the increasing awareness of health, electric foot spas are becoming more popular among consumers. In the market, there are many different types of foot spas available, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. This gives consumers a lot of choices. According to relevant data, sales of electric foot spas and other health-related household appliances have been booming, but there are no specific industry standards for electric foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. "Dipping your feet in electricity is too dangerous, isn't it?" Li said to the reporter. Recently, he bought an electric foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father used it, he felt his feet going numb. Li first thought it was the vibration function of the foot spa that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet going numb. Li used an electric pen to test it, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. After contacting the seller, the seller's attitude was not bad, but Li still felt uncomfortable after returning the foot spa. Because he found that this popular foot spa did not have any clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the highest temperature setting, the target audience, and the materials used to ensure safety. However, in general, electric foot spas are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have issues during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a foot spa with a modular design. Water and electricity separation, no safety risks. At the same time, you can test it with an electric pen.

The vice-chairman of the China Foreign Trade Cooperation Commission and the vice-chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress attended the opening ceremony.  Professor Liu Jianhua of the Chinese Academy of Engineering gave a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, emphasizing that the source of Hunan red tea is in Xiangyang, and red tea has risen as "Five-Color Xiang Tea" to inject new vitality.  In recent years, the Hunan Provincial Committee and the Hunan Provincial Government have provided strong support for the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the billion-dollar Xiang Tea Production Industry, and forming the development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, Five Colors Tea".  The tea industry in Hunan has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main power tea varieties, promoting tea tourism integration, and driving large-scale tea farming increase.  The wind and water flow, and red tea again gains strength.  Tea experts in Hunan said that after picking green tea, black tea, and red tea, tea farmers can have income throughout the year, and the value of tea plantations continues to increase.  At the opening ceremony, Hunan leaders granted patents to four enterprises that have been granted permission to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark.  In the new Hunan Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant saw a high-mountain tea named "Ice Inside Spring" and immediately placed an order.  Wang Quan, secretary-general of the Hunan Tea Industry Association, was excited and said that despite the impact of the epidemic and other factors on the tea market, from the tea expo, the bright spots are abundant.  New Hunan Red Tea injects new vitality into tea culture, and the popularity and trade are booming, and the Xiang Tea Production Industry welcomes a new spring.

Shepherd Che (chè), whose real name is Jiāngbō, was born in the Year of the Sheep, Month of the Sheep, on the grassy hills of Shepherd Che. He is well-suited for his life as a shepherd and is affectionately known as "Shepherd Uncle" by the people. Due to the publication of the "Thailand Mystery Code" series' "Thailand Strange Tales," "India Strange Tales," "Japan Strange Tales," "Korea Strange Tales," and other works, he has earned the nickname "Suspicious Genius" in the literary world. He claims to be a master of "speaking eight paths with a single scripture" in his work "Lamp in the Dark" (also known as "China Strange Tales"). "Suspicious Genius" Shepherd Che uses his latest work, "Lamp in the Dark," to take readers on a deep dive into the essence of Chinese folklore, exploring the legends that have been passed down through generations and the heart-wrenching love-hate stories behind them. "Journey to the West" South Star Pavilion and Moonless Flower open up a new chapter of their deadly exploration of the mysteries of the universe. Their true identities are about to be revealed. "Suspicious Genius" Shepherd Che has white hair and has sold over a million copies of his books. The new work "Lamp in the Dark" is the latest addition to the "Thailand Mystery Code" series, with the same author and protagonist, continuing the unfinished story of "Thailand Strange Tales" and "India Strange Tales."

Hello, I'm a beginner programmer who wants to share my personal experience. If you're planning to enter the industry, it's a good idea to find a training program. However, if you don't have any specific ideas, it's best to self-study. Training can be expensive and time-consuming, requiring 6 months of study. But if you're determined to enter the industry, training can be a great choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.  Choosing a good training institution is crucial. First, you need to consider the strength of the instructor's qualifications. If the instructor's qualifications are not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. However, some new training institutions may not have very strong instructor qualifications. Second, before making a decision, it's a good idea to explore the training institution and its students. Only the students of the institution can truly tell you how good or bad the institution is, and what courses are good or bad.  I'm sorry, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have enough information about your specific situation. Factors such as major, age, language, and location can all affect your learning or desired career path. If you're a student and still haven't graduated, or if you're a computer science graduate, self-study may be the most efficient and cost-effective option. Many online and offline training institutions are now very good, but they can be expensive and require a significant investment of time. However, if you're in my situation, self-study is very convenient. Many online learning resources are now free, or you can find them on Bilibili. If you can't find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed advice.  Additionally, some classic books can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning. If you're not a computer science major but can afford to pay for learning expenses and time, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without having to spend too much effort, the teacher's explanations are detailed, and there are people available to answer questions. Moreover, many training institutions now sign job placement agreements, have internal recommendations, and can help you find work after you graduate, which can save you a lot of time during the job search process.  In summary, this is my opinion. Since I don't know your specific situation, I can only provide a general overview. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me for further discussion.

What are you doing while I haven't finished speaking?
I accept all kinds of (installation, cleaning, repair) wall-mounted water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil burners, lamps, and decorative items. I specialize in professional sewing. I thank those who silently praise me for my efforts in life. Life is hard, but we must continue to strive. Life will not punish those who make every effort. Just follow me, and thank those who silently praise me. Life is like this. People only see the results, but we must carry on by ourselves. We can look back at the past, but we cannot go back.  Cleaning is work, and it is also a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of sincerity. We may do the dirtiest work, but we will do it with the most sincere attitude, cleaning every corner of the customer's home until it is completely dry and clean. When we see the customer's satisfied smile and raised thumb, we know that all our efforts were worth it. Our daily work is your request, and our service is your satisfaction. We serve with sincerity and clean with sincerity, keeping everything beautiful.  The details that you care about have been done to the best of our ability, and we have made your home "clean" to the best of our ability. We serve you with love. Keep your home clean and tidy, both indoors and outdoors. Our daily work is to keep your home clean and tidy. Although the water lamp is beautiful, it will lose its luster if it is not cleaned regularly. Only after cleaning it will it shine brightly again. Life is the same way. To succeed, we must be sincere, and to create beauty, we must be meticulous. We are sincere. Give us a chance, and we will make you satisfied. The quality speaks for itself, and we are trustworthy. Your approval is our encouragement.  Every business is tough right now. But I believe that as long as we have a sincere attitude, perseverance, and hard work, we will be better than others, at least a little bit. Let's start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and good fortune. I hope you carry these things with you as you start a new day. Good morning! In the morning, happiness starts. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and good fortune with you as you start a new day. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning! Happiness is a thing, and having it is happiness. When we grow up, happiness is a goal, and achieving it is happiness. When we grow old, happiness is a state of mind, and understanding it is happiness. Be the best version of yourself, and do it with sincerity. Follow your heart, and don't regret anything in this life. Life is a journey, and we must walk our own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a happy mind. We must treasure them both and live a bright and lively life until we are old.  Each stage of life brings its own challenges. Often, it is not our abilities that bind us, but our willingness to face them bravely. Since we cannot avoid them, let's face them bravely. The more afraid we are, the more likely we are to be knocked down by difficulties. But if we face them bravely, the problems will solve themselves.
The First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition of Saudi Arabia Opens - Xinhua News Agency 12/12/2021 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Qiang) The First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition of Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency 12/12/2021 (Reporter Wang Haizhou, Hu Qiang)  The First Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition of Saudi Arabia opened on November 11 at the JAX Art Zone in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other countries participated in the exhibition. The exhibition was jointly organized by the Saudi Binladin Group and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. The director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China, Tian Hao Yu, served as the art director. According to the organizers, the theme of the exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as the current development situation of Saudi Arabian society. The exhibition occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and consists of six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Facing the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art." Among them, 27 Saudi Arabian artists' works account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, including paintings, installation art, and performance art, among others. Similarly, 12 Chinese artists' works are also attracting attention, with some artists using recycled materials to create art in a new way, such as Xu Bing in the "Behind the Scenes Series: The Endless Mountains" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials. According to the Saudi Binladin Group, the goal of the exhibition is to establish international dialogue and provide global audiences with an opportunity to understand the rapidly developing cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, as well as to strengthen mutual communication. Tian Hao Yu said, "The goal of the exhibition is double-folded: to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and to allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world." It is reported that during the opening period of the exhibition, a series of lectures will also be held, with artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry discussing topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered a meat cleaver from a restaurant. The restaurant told me that they cannot send the bone with the meat cleaver. I want to know the reason clearly. The bone can be sent, but the restaurant needs to package it and send it separately.

Yunnan: Standardized Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, Yunnan Province, December 12, 2021 (Reporter Lin Baiqiang)  To promote the continuous employment of impoverished people and consolidate the expansion of poverty alleviation achievements, Yunnan Province recently issued a series of policies related to the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, in order to comprehensively promote the revitalization of rural areas. The Yunnan Provincial People's Social Welfare Bureau introduced related responsible persons, stating that as of now, Yunnan Province has developed 44,830 public welfare positions, which are used to employ impoverished labor force and other difficult groups in rural areas, and play an important role in helping impoverished groups achieve employment increase, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the public service ability of various items in rural areas.  This new rule was jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial People's Social Welfare Bureau, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments. The main objective of the rule is to standardize the recruitment of personnel for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions, etc.  In the development of positions, the new rule clarifies that according to the principles of "on-demand positioning, personnel positioning, dynamic management, total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person, one post, self-disclosure, and unified management," the positions should be set up. The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-training, and on-the-job training.  In addition, the new rule also clarifies the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for public welfare positions, and the requirement that each public welfare position development department should purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position employees. It is also required that relevant departments should regularly monitor the payment of subsidies for public welfare positions.
The address is incorrect. Hello, can you cancel the order? I will reorder. Is the order already canceled?
二、尽管右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。 但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。 从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。 三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。 但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。 四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。 再聊聊左。 左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。 如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔弃的糟粕！ 五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。 跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。 也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？ 我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！ 许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘记理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。 和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。 左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。 而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。 现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。 虽然看不懂，点赞就完事儿啦 啥也不说了，花花就是这么仗义
"It's time to place an order at 7:06 PM, which is 2 hours from now 😂"
Today let's take a look at some [weird trending topics]. What is normal public opinion? Let's randomly select three trending topics: "February 2nd Dragon Head," "Beautiful Friendship Price Rise," and "Hualala Event," and the public opinion will form a peak, then it will have an exponential decline (smooth curve) and eventually dissipate. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small peak again. They look different from the network public opinion evolution model displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration. What is abnormal public opinion? Let's randomly select six trending topics related to the same event and present them in a [peak-trough-cliff] pattern. A [peak-trough-cliff] pattern means that a topic quickly rises to the top of the search rankings and attracts public attention; a [tooth-like pattern] means that a topic is periodically heated up, ensuring that it stays on the hot search rankings; a [cliff pattern] means that a topic is abandoned, and its function is exhausted, and it is replaced by a new task or a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of a topic's heat wave is exactly the trough of another topic's heat wave, with no time difference, which means that a unified batch of water troops has been assigned to the task, and a new round of attack has been launched. The professionalization of black PR can be seen everywhere: dozens of trending topics appear at the same time, which topics attract attention, which ones are responsible for explaining, which ones stir up controversy, which ones change direction, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, and which ones manipulate decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and they are precisely targeted at all elements of public opinion dissemination. Propagation is a science, which ignores subjective factors such as stance and emotion, and only looks at objective data, black PR will also have no place to hide. Any traces left behind will be indelible, and we will dig them out together. The source of data: hot search time machine.
The first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus have been reported in Mauritius, Seychelles, and Malawi. In Mauritius, the first two cases were reported on December 10th, involving a tourist who arrived from South Africa on November 27th and a local resident who came into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa on November 30th. After being hospitalized and treated, both individuals tested negative for the virus on December 1st. They have since returned to their respective homes. On December 10th, the Seychelles Ministry of Health announced the country's first three cases of Omicron infection, all of which were students who had traveled from China in early November and were experiencing mild symptoms. To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Seychelles government has increased its control measures. From December 6th to January 10th, all passengers arriving by plane aged 12 and above will be required to undergo a self-funded nucleic acid test at the airport. The Seychelles Ministry of Health also announced on December 10th that it would begin administering the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to children aged 5 to 11 in the country. On November 9th, the Malawi Ministry of Health announced the country's first three cases of Omicron infection, all of which were detected through gene sequencing of samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd.

Can I get a refund for the previous order if I place a new one?
If it doesn't work, please cancel the order and refund.
Thinking of calling for breakfast early can help you eat early, but now it's 7 o'clock and we haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you are saying... Is your Chinese translated from another language, or do you prefer to use English?
Do you want to call him and talk to him?

I don't think this action is helpful at all!
I received the money in my belly, the order is from Phoenix Claw, okay. The phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called the staff to explain the situation.

大美360集成家装 地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼 一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。 来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。 我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。 他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经验和他们打理论战）。 我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。 这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。 他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。 除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。 我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。 当我去找他们退款的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。 无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。 各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。 坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。 所以大家别选择这样坑爹的装修公司。 以后大家在选择的时候多百度看看这些查一下这些咨询因为装修不是小钱。 想要向商家提问，请先登录或注册 严禁发布各种形式的商家点评，详细请见商户收录声明 大众点评昆明装修设计频道为您提供大美360集成家装地址，电话，营业时间等最新商户信息，找装修公司装修公司，就上大众点评
This is so scary! If it's not going to be delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other method left? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my money back within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely investigate.
I asked if it was possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The chicken should be cooked, but the received one is raw, so it can't be eaten.
It has been 3 days without a response... Due to your system not being able to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan! The strange thing is that I always pay with the same credit card every time, and now I have to pay shipping fees every time. Can you first waive the fees, and then collect my monthly fee after you have finished investigating? Is that possible?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It is already 3 o'clock. Is it necessary to give me compensation? I said to knock on the door and deliver the goods, but the courier put the package on the doorstep, and then the person walked away. It was delivered incorrectly.
Your delivery person has already picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still waiting. The delivery person received your order at 19:25, but they are still not willing to leave. Should I buy other food? What should I do? Where did your delivery person go? Do I still have to wait?
I am going to send the invoice. Okay, you won't cancel it, I will report it.
However, my food may have safety and health issues.

Thank you for your help. I have received the discount code and there are no issues. Please note that there is no need to resend it as I have already purchased it separately. I appreciate your assistance.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such behavior. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must reject this kind of evil. If you don't look at the political party and faction, the first thing to resist should be this kind of uncivilized behavior. From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests and posting offensive posts, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude. You continued to tag me at a frequency of one post per day, and in your Facebook conversations with your so-called friends, you continued to make obscene and insulting comments about me, such as my appearance, body shape, health, and bedding, and so on. I... I can't take it anymore. How do I know that later, many of my friends will post photos of you on their Facebook accounts and post offensive comments about you? I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news was posted, you didn't calm down, but instead became even more boisterous. In our society, respect for women is needed. Yes, you can continue to make offensive, obscene, insulting, and derogatory comments, and you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, and you can continue to deny that it's you who made the photo or continue to post offensive comments. There's no doubt about it. I can't and don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need your evaluation. I even don't believe there's any woman who would willingly let herself be humiliated like this in exchange for fame. My friend asked me, are you okay? I said yes, you won't believe me. I think no woman can be humiliated like this and still say she's okay. No matter in work, society, politics, or business, only those who lack basic morals will choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice is in the heart. I cut off some of your comments and gave them to everyone for review. Your own posts should be hard to imitate, right? I can only say that you are a civilized enemy, with a heart of gold.
I have reported and attached the images, but there has been no response.

The High-Speed Train Home   Address: High-Speed North Road 555 Number   Check the map   This home is quite complete, with many brands and well-known brands.   On December 12th, go to the "Hansen" water purifier store and check the water purifiers. The store is currently doing activities, and the prices are quite favorable.   The home has 11 floors, and the negative second floor to the negative ninth floor are all parking areas, and the white day is free!   The surrounding area is not very good. There are few restaurants and shops nearby, and the restaurant taste is generally poor.   This elevator is also very strange. It looks like it has a big disease, and the negative second floor to the negative first floor are all going back and forth, and I can't stop pressing this layer. From the safe passage down to the first floor, it's also very strange, and it's directly connected to a furniture store. The furniture store door is locked, and the safe passage can't go out!   The home still needs to be improved, and there are many places that haven't been developed.   Address: Sandibak District, High-Speed North Road 555 Number, Convenient transportation, large parking lot, and white day is still free.   Environment: To be honest, the store is quite large, with 8-9 floors, and there are many things you want to buy, such as furniture, household appliances, various small items... All can be bought here, and many well-known brands have entered the store. Taoist, Euclid, Huai Di, Laoban, Feng Cai, Hansen, Yak, Friendship, Silk, Rich Home, Wanjiale, Dashanren, Zhonglian, Meidi, Yadan... The brands are really too many, I can only remember so much, it's a good place to buy products, and it's tiring to walk around, you can sit on the sofa and rest.   Recently, I want to buy a comfortable sofa, my friend said there are many comfortable sofas here, I looked at the High-Speed Train Home and Meidi Meijia, and I feel it's still okay, just the price is a little high, so I'm still thinking about it.   The High-Speed Train Home Channel on Dianping provides the latest information on the merchant, address, phone, and business hours for you. Find a decoration company, just go to Dianping.

The Longjiang Dry Dock Realizes Full Coverage of the Green Comprehensive Service Zone on Water - Xinhua News Agency Wuhan 12/11/2021 (Reporter Wang Jing) The Longjiang Dry Dock in Chongqing was successfully completed and put into operation on the 10th, following the successful operation of the Longjiang Green Comprehensive Service Zone in Sichuan Province on the 8th. This marks the second Longjiang Green Comprehensive Service Zone in the upstream of the Longjiang River to be put into operation. As of now, Green Comprehensive Service Zones have been established and put into operation in the upstream, middle, and downstream of the Longjiang River in various provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu. The Deputy Director of the Transportation and Communications Department of the Longjiang Navigation Management Bureau, Xu Jianhui, introduced that before this, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already established and put into operation 10 Green Comprehensive Service Zones in the upstream, middle, and downstream of the Longjiang River, which have been widely recognized by ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Longjiang navigation. The full coverage of Green Comprehensive Service Zones is another milestone event in the construction of Longjiang Green Navigation. The reception of Longjiang River pollution materials and the navigation service capability have been significantly improved. According to the introduction, the Green Comprehensive Service Zone is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for large ships and ship crews, helping large ship crews solve the "urgent difficulty and anxiety" problem. This time, two Green Comprehensive Service Zones have been successfully built and put into operation in the upstream of the Longjiang River, integrating life services, production services, and political services into one body, with the theme of green environmental protection, and with ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as special features, realizing the "one-time docking, multiple services" for ships in the harbor. This will make the work of common ship crews in the Longjiang River more efficient and their living conditions more convenient.
