Android hardware Cleaning tip Thin (0.3mm - 0.5mm) DRY interdental brushes are ideal for clearing those tiny port holes which house your smart device microphones and speakers. They are a cheap product and safer than many other methods, such as rubbing alcohols, tooth picks, pins, and needles. I just used this method to clear the microphone port on my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic as it was not registering my voice when using speech to text functions. After months of thinking, I would need to arrange a warranty replacement or need to book a repair. After much frustration shouting at my watch during phone calls so I could be heard and/or understood. After following manufacturer advice and using the water lock functions, resetting the device AND factory restoring my device. And after scouring the internet on multiple occasions. There seemed to be no guaranteed satisfaction. Then I had a revelation and I tried interdental brushes, and they work... They work very VERY well! After a few pokes and twizzles with the thin but firm bristled rod, your device should work just as it did when it was brand new. *I advise this be done with a dry brush, and will not accept any repercussion if you decide to use it with any combination of any cleaning product.

South Africa Pays Tribute to Last Apartheid Leader De Klerk South Africa on Sunday paid an official tribute to FW de Klerk, the final president of white rule, who freed Nelson Mandela from prison and steered the country from apartheid to democracy. De Klerk died on November 11 aged 85 following a battle with cancer. Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor. He served as president from 1989 to 1994 and is remembered most for leading South Africa's transition from white-minority rule to the first multi-racial elections in 1994. De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990. Mandela then became South Africa's first black president after his African National Congress party won the 1994 election. President Cyril Ramaphosa attended Cape Town's Protestant Groote Kerk - one of South Africa's oldest churches - on Sunday morning to deliver a eulogy in De Klerk's honor. "He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees. I shall never forget this man who mesmerized me, who made me want to help him achieve this huge task ahead of him. A private mass and the national anthem preceded the ceremony, which featured a portrait of De Klerk between two candles and a choir decorated with white flowers. Despite a positive reputation abroad, De Klerk divided opinion in South Africa and his death prompted mixed reactions. Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer. De Klerk represented the National Party, which in 1948 formally established apartheid's racial segregation and disenfranchisement of South Africa's non-white majority. Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police. The surrounding area was closed to traffic and placed under high security. Comments in his final years also tarnished De Klerk's image amid criticism for his failure to apologize officially for the crimes of apartheid. In 2020, he denied apartheid was a crime against humanity before retracting the statement and apologizing. De Klerk's foundation issued a posthumous video apologizing "for the pain, hurt, indignity and damage that apartheid has done" to South Africa's non-white populations.

南非悼念最后一位白人政府领导人·德克尔克

2021年11月11日，南非正式悼念了最后一位白人政府领导人·德克尔克，他在1990年释放纳尔森曼德拉的时候，将南非从白人少数治理转变为1994年的第一次多种族选举。德克尔克于85岁因癌症死亡。四天的国家悼念声明在他的荣誉之名。德克尔克从1989年到1994年服务作为总统。他被记住最为领导南非从白人少数治理转变为第一次多种族选举的过程。德克尔克还与纳尔森曼德拉共同获得了1993年的诺贝尔和平奖，当时他释放了曼德拉从监狱中。曼德拉后来成为南非的第一位黑人总统，当他的非洲国民党党团队在1994年选举中获胜时。2021年11月11日上午，南非总统艾里尔·拉马菲茨在卡莫特镇的大教堂里，在德克尔克的荣誉之名发表了悼念谈话。德克尔克的妻子艾里特·乔里亚迪斯告诉大约200名参加者：“我永远不会忘记这个人，他让我感到醉，让我想要帮助他完成这项巨大的任务。”私人的祭祭和国家歌声 preceded了 ceremony，其中包括德克尔克的肖像在两只烧灯之间，加上装有白花的歌手队伍。尽管德克尔克在国际上具有良好的声名，但在南非内部他被分离，他的死亡引发了混乱的反应。批判说他仍然与违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反违反

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt. Darren Moss. The identity of the man who died hasn't been released, but authorities say he wasn't breathing after being pulled out of the snow and didn't survive despite CPR efforts by another skier. The other skiers in his group rescued themselves with the help of two witnesses who saw them get swept up by the snow. All were wearing avalanche beacons. While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion. "Skiers can travel at will wherever they want in the national forest. They had gone out into the forest but ended up back in bounds (of the resort) where this slide occurred," DeBerry said In addition to shutting the area where the slide occurred, the resort earlier in the day closed the Mt. Rainier Gondola because of winds reaching 100 miles per hour (161 kilometers per hour). The avalanche came amid the season's first major snowfall. The area is under a winter storm warning until Sunday morning, with the National Weather Service saying 12 to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of snow is possible for areas above 2,000 feet (610 meters). "We've had a late start to the season and now we've gone from virtually no snow to a giant snow storm. People got excited," DeBerry said. "We all have to remember that it's a sport that carries risk." Crystal Mountain is the largest ski resort in Washington state, encompassing 2,600 acres (1,052 hectares).

 [/INST] 雪丧生命，五人被捕捉在华盛州滑雪场景中的雪丧事故导致了一名60岁的男子的死亡，同时临时捕捉了五名人士。雪丧事故发生于2021年1月8日上午10时50分在华盛州的克里斯特尔山滑雪场景的银基基地区。克里斯特尔山滑雪场景位于约85英里（137公里）东南于西雅伯克的位置。克里斯特尔山滑雪场景管理部门的 Sergeant Darren Moss 确认了事件发生时间。事件发生后，被捕捉的人士被认为没有呼吸，尽管另一个滑雪者试图救生他，但他没有生命。被捕捉的人士的滑雪团队成员使用了两名见证者的帮助，自救了自己。所有被捕捉在雪丧事故中的人士都是经验的背景滑雪者，但在克里斯特尔山滑雪场景的边界上发生的雪丧事故是受到了警告。克里斯特尔山滑雪场景是一个私人的滑雪场景，决定了条件，但是没有什么可以阻止滑雪者进入该场景，因为该场景边界接近公共地区的国家森林。克里斯特尔山滑雪场景的总统 Frank DeBerry 说，所有六名人士都持有滑雪场景的上坡旅行通行证，这意味着他们被注册了滑雪队伍，参加了通过场景的地方进行背景滑雪的方式和位置的培训，并且必须在他们的出席前检查雪情。“滑雪者可以自由地在国家森林中旅行。他们在森林中进行了旅行，但最终回到了场景的边界，在这里发生了雪丧事故”，德伯里说。在雪丧事故发生之前，场景已经早上关闭了 Mt. Rainier 凳轨汽车，因为风速达到了100英里/小时（161公里/小时）。雪丧事故发生在季节的第一次重大雪fall中。该区域在2000英尺（610米）以上正在受 winter storm warning，国家天气服务说可能会有12到15英寸（38公里）的雪降下。“我们有了一个晚晚开始的季节，现在我们从几乎没有雪变成了巨大的雪storm。人们很兴奋”，德伯里说。“我们都需要记住，这是一个带有风险的运动。”克里斯特尔山是华盛州最大的滑雪场景，涵盖了2600英里（1052平方公里）。

Hey r/Military! I am from a country where military duty is mandatory and I am just wondering how's it like for other countries. Hello everyone! I am from Estonia, where I am part of the National Defense Force. Here military service is mandatory for all men from the ages of 16-29. You have to complete either 8 or 11 months of training after which you are sent to the "reserve" unit until you turn 60. In that time, the Defense Force is eligible to demand you take part in some military exercises once or twice a year for approx 2 weeks per year. However, you are not mandated to go on a foreign mission. If you want to do that, you have to join the "scouts battalion" where you will be a professional military dude with pay and such. I am just wondering how is it for other countries? If you join the military in, for example, the USA or the UK, then are you mandated to go fight in another country? What do you guys think about mandatory military service? During training when I was in Tapa 2018-2019, there were also units from the UK, US, France, Belgium, Denmark and Canada. Unfortunately though, we really didn't have much time to socialize and I didn't get to ask those guys in person what it's like for them to serve in their country's military. I know that there are probably mostly NATO members in this subreddit, but it would be interesting to hear from other (non-NATO) countries as well. Sorry for my poor grammar. English is my second language.

 [/INST] 你好，r/军事！我来自一个军事服务是强制的国家，我只是想了解其他国家的军事服务情况。你好大家！我来自埃斯特里亚，我是埃斯特里亚国家防御力的一部分。在我们这里，军事服务是强制的，所有男性从16到29岁都必须服务。你需要完成8个月或11个月的培训，然后你会被发送到“保留单位”，直到你60岁。在这段时间内，国家防御力有权要求你每年参加一次或两次军事演习，大约每年2周。然而，你不被强制要求参加外国任务。如果你想参加外国任务，你需要加入“侦察队伍”，你会成为专业军事人士，有薪资和其他福利。我只是想了解其他国家的军事服务情况。如果你在，例如，美国或英国加入军事，那么你被强制要求参加另一个国家的战斗？你们认为强制军事服务有好处嗎？在2018-2019年在塔巴的培训期间，我们还有英国、美国、法国、比利荷、丹麦和加拿大的单位。 unfortunate的是，我们没有太多时间和那些人交流，我也没有能力直接问他们他们在他们国家军事服务中的情况。我知道大家可能大多数是NATO成员，但我想了解其他（非NATO）国家的情况也很有趣。抱歉我的语法不太好。英文是我的第二语言。

I enjoy articles like this help untangle the convoluted web of sociopathic megalomaniac men that my dad glorified ad nauseam and the plurality of leaders he decried. Guess where Nixon and Carter fell, and his golden boy Reagan could do no ills. While I have long since known that this world view is complete BS and in fact I despise each of those megalomaniacs from Caesar through Bonaparte, Nixon, Reagan, Bush and Trump, I can appreciate the historical significance of Caesar or Napoleon, but the quasi-sacred nature of their sanitized histories turned me off them later on in life. To this day, I still refuse to study the history of Poland as that would just allow the paranoid conspiracies of my dad to bubble forward. Returning to this article, I love the small details that remind you that there actually was one good choice (despite smaller flaws - but mostly acting in good faith) and one side that was not good, did not act in good faith, and where malice was and is the more likely explanation than stupidity. That's the thing. Republicans love to hide behind stupidity rather than admit malice, but make no mistake if the ideological basis of a party is being under siege. Then coincidence, serendipity, etc. rarely exist. The besieged mentality means that every action must count, or else you are expensing limited energy on frivolous acts. But Republicans love to hide behind our more nuanced understanding of the world and try to throw back the various philosophical razors.

 [/INST] 我喜欢像这一篇文章这样的文章，因为它帮助我弄清楚我 dad 崇敬的那些 sociopathic 宠物主义者的复杂网络，以及他谴责的那些领导人的多元性。我知道这种世界观点是完全错误的，事实上我对这些宠物主义者从伦敦到特朗普都感到恶意。然而，我仍然可以欣赏这些历史的重要性，例如伦敦和伦敦的伦敦。但是，这些人的 quasi-神化的历史让我感到不興。直到今天，我仍然拒绝研究波兰的历史，因为这就会让我 dad 的恶意疑慮冒出来。回到这篇文章，我喜欢这篇文章中的小细节，因为它提醒我，尽管这些人有一些小错误，但是有一个良好的选项，一个不良的方向，在这里，恶意是更可能的解释，而不是愚愚。 Republicans 喜欢隐藏 behind愚愚而不是承认恶意，但是如果一个党的理念受到攻击，那么偶然、幸运等几乎不存在。被攻击的心态意味着每个动作都必须重要，否则你就浪费了有限的能力在无关的事情上。但是， Republicans 喜欢隐藏在我们更复杂的理解世界的背景下，试图抛出各种哲学利弊。

Sunday Best: Enter 1880s New York in HBO's "The Gilded Age" Hat and parasol alert! "The Gilded Age," created by Julian Fellowes ("Downton Abbey") and written by Fellowes and Sonja Warfield, premieres next month on HBO.

Also in the cast are Christine Baranski, Cynthia Nixon, Carrie Coon and Morgan Spector, among many more. Good fun for the winter, no? The costumes, which look to be quite lavish indeed, are designed by Kasia Walicka-Maimone, whose previous work includes "The Goldfinch," "A Quiet Place" and "Moonrise Kingdom."

Move the trailer! Years ago, I worked at a cabinet shop. I went on an install with the owner, and when we came back he parked the empty trailer close to the dumpster. No reason in particular, there was just space there, so that’s where he left it. The next morning I come into work and Jerry (not his real name) comes up to me looking pissed about something. Nothing new, he was always sort of grumpy old fella. The conversation went something similar to below (18 years ago, so I don’t remember exactly). Jerry: Did you park that trailer there by the dumpster? Me: No, the owner drove yesterday. Jerry: You can’t park that trailer there, then I can’t get to the dumpster! Me: I didn’t park it there, the owner did, but I can move it. Jerry: I don’t know why you would park that trailer there. You know we need to have access to the dumpster. Me: but I didn’t park it there. Why don’t you talk to the owner about it? Jerry: blah blah blah your fault, damn kids have no respect, blah blah blah Me: It was not me. The conversation continued in that manner for several minutes, with him berating me for leaving the trailer in the way that I didn’t leave in the way. From that day forward, until I left that cabinet shop a couple years later, any time I worked late (which was more often than not) and the 5x8 trailer was at the shop, I’d pick up the tongue and roll it right up to the dumpster for Jerry to find in the morning.

In addition to the above item, we have over 250,000 comics in stock, including both back issues and new items. All our comics are supplied from our real world store enabling us to offer a huge range of comics via auction. We've probably got what you're looking for! (If placing multiple orders, please request an invoice for the correct amount BEFORE paying.) This item is an original American comic and is in English! Please note that all our comics in every grade (EVEN POOR) will be complete unless stated otherwise in the listing! Please take the time to review both the attached cover scan and detailed grade description above to ensure that this particular comic is in the condition you require. Most of our listings offer Multi-Buy discounts. Usually starting at 3 or more items to gain the discount. The items can be ANY combination of ANY ITEMS included in the Multi-Buy. They DO NOT have to be multiple copies of the same item. Just pick the required total quantity and you'll automatically be given the discount on all of them! Some of our items include the option to place a best offer. If there is a Best Offer option, we'll consider any reasonable offer. We do not list ANY comics as Mint condition. In our view, this grade does not exist. Comic books are mass produced paper items, handled many times often with little care before even reaching the shop or newsstand to be offered for sale. EVERY COMIC, even a brand new one, will have some form of minor defect if you get out a magnifying glass and look closely enough. If you are intent on finding comic book perfection, or CGC guaranteed results, it would probably be best to view the comics in person at our store before bidding!

Family pays tribute to "energetic" 18-year-old stabbed to death in Birmingham The family of a teenager who was stabbed to death in Birmingham have described him as a "young, energetic 18-year-old" who dreamed of being a digital marketing specialist. Yahya Sharif was found seriously injured in Coventry Road, Small Heath, just before 5.30pm on Friday, West Midlands Police said. Police were called to the scene by the ambulance service. Despite the best efforts of paramedics, Yahya, from Nechells, was confirmed dead at the scene. A post-mortem revealed he died from a stab wound to the chest. A statement released on behalf of his family said: "We cannot believe that Yahya has disappeared from our eyes. We still don't know the reason he was killed. A young, energetic 18-year-old, his dream was to be a digital marketing specialist. The whole community are shocked. May God be with the family he left behind, especially his parents." Detectives have been gathering CCTV and other evidence as they try to piece together what happened and identify and trace who stabbed the teenager. Detective Inspector Hannah Whitehouse, from the homicide unit, said: "Yahya was just 18 and with his life ahead of him. This has now been taken away in the most tragic of circumstances. There is no clear motive for the attack and we're working round the clock to identify and trace who was responsible. We've spoken to a number of witnesses but we still need to hear from anyone with information who can help us. I'd appeal for those who were there at the time to do the right thing, come and speak to us and tell us exactly what happened and why. It's the least Yahya's family deserve."

An Alamo location in California pulled a similar scam on me. When I returned the car, the agent found scratches under the car (which I did not cause). Had to sign to acknowledge the “damage”. I also had videos and photos which didn’t cover the bottom of the car. A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental. None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle). None of it was visible on the photos I took when I returned the car so I disputed the claim. They denied the dispute and demanded immediate payment for the damage. Since it was a work trip, I turned my photos over to our legal department. I received a letter from Alamo a short while later saying that they were going to waive the charges in the interest of customer satisfaction. If I had been on my own, I certainly would have wound up paying the bill for damage which I am certain didn’t happen while the car was in my care.

> Decoupling will need them to make sure their apps work on all different iOS versions. This isn't even necessarily true. Just put a cap on the versions of iOS that the app supports and only push out updates for devices with the latest compatible versions of iOS. That's how most apps work now. > Also, since Apple can release new iOS and macOS versions frequently. Isn't the problem that this still isn't frequently enough? It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time? And what does "the developers can be confident that their patch/feature will get pushed out in the new release" even mean? > This is in contrast to Google. Google had to delink because there were a lot of Android versions in the wild, each with a huge market share. I can say without a doubt that if Android versions on phones were consistent like iOS, Google would never have done the releases with OS releases for these apps. That's a bold claim, but either way it still doesn't explain how bundling app updates as OS updates is "better" for the developers, or the end user.

 [/INST] 解耐需要他们确保他们的应用在所有不同的iOS版本上运行。但是，这并不一定是真的。只需要限制应用支持的iOS版本，并只推出对最近兼容的iOS版本的设备的更新。这是大多数应用现在的做法。

此外，由于Apple可以频繁发布新的iOS和macOS版本。但是，这仍然不够频繁，并且导致了很差的UX。即使Apple增加了OS更新的频率，以考虑一些应用中的小错误修复，为什么用户每次都需要执行完整的OS升级？并且“开发人员可以确定他们的补丁/功能将在新版本中推出”意味着什么？

这与谷歌相反。谷歌因为有许多不同版本的Android手机，每个版本都有大量的市场份额。如果Android手机版本在手机上保持一致，谷歌一定不会做这样的OS版本更新。但是，即使这仍然不能解释如何将应用更新 bundled 为 OS 更新对开发人员和终端用户有益。

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator. However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

 [/INST]  gabba的双重电气故障解释和为什么可能会重复发生

 gabba 的电气故障 inherent 在 cricket stadium 设置中的风险，不太可能在下一次 Ashes 比赛之前会有所改善，因为 cricket 专业人员正在等待更多的详细信息关于 stadium 的主要升级计划，以在 2032 年举行奥lympic Games。来源告诉 The Age 和 The Sydney Morning Herald， gabba 是澳大利亚 cricket 中唯一的主要 stadium，ground 内的主要电气供应不足以为世界播出的广播车辆和设备提供电气。在第四天的比赛上， gabba Test 的主要电气供应和备用电气供应，由于 gabba 的基本电气供应需要供应 gabba 的光塔和地面，因此广播者从一个巨大的 Diesel 燃油车辆中提取了主要电气供应，备用电气供应则需要从一个备用的 Diesel 燃油车辆中提取。但是，在第四天的比赛上，主要电气供应的故障与备用电气供应的故障结合，导致两者同时故障，导致广播图像和 DRS 的全部或部分失败，近 30 分钟。NEP，为 Fox 和 Seven 提供外部广播车辆和其他设施的公司，已经向提供生产器的公司寻求解释。所有用于 Ashes 比赛的其他地点，包括 Adelaide Oval、MCG、SCG 和 Hobart 的 Bellerive Oval，都将提供主要供应为广播者的电气，备用电气供应由 Diesel 燃油车辆提供。这种差异，在过去几个月中已经给 Fox Cricket 带来了困扰，在 Ashes 比赛中被加剧了，因为比赛中的巨大减少了生产和技术staff 的数量，使其难以监控比赛中的各种虚拟球。Cricket Australia 被告诉 Fox 几个月以来，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允许进入 Queensland 的巨大风险，如果比赛在 gabba 上继续，那么 inherent 在 skeleton crew 允

The dog that would not stop barking and how I got him to stop. My neighbors got a dog about three years ago. These neighbors and I share a fence. It separates our back yards. Well, this dog snarls and barks and tries to bite me through the fence the entire time I'm out in the backyard. I've tried to ignore it, talk softly, etc. but this dog is insane. The maintenance guys are afraid of it. So I went and did the neighborly thing and asked them to help me figure out how to get this dog to chill. I can't even use my yard at this point. That dog is outside all day long, snarling and yapping non-stop. I asked if I could give it healthy treats through the fence. Owner says no. I asked if we could go in halves on a non-shock bark collar. Owner says no. (Edit to say I asked the neighbor at least three times to help her dog.) Frustrated but not willing to call animal control or anything yet, I hatched a plan. I bought a very nice portable speaker that is *loud*. Like, I saved and invested in this. Now, every time I go to my backyard, I bring my speaker. There is no daytime noise ordinance here, I checked. When the dog begins its snarling barking attacking the fence thing, my neighbors (all of them) get to enjoy a little Lamb of God or Rotting Christ or some other great music turned all the way up. My speaker shakes the table. It didn't take the neighbors long to put two and two together. The dog is now kept mostly inside and when it does come out, it's quick or the owner goes out with it. The neighborhood is wonderfully quiet nowadays. Edit some grammar errors Edit again: PSA DO NOT GIVE DOGS ANY TYPE OF HUMAN MEDICATION, LIKE LAXITIVES OR NYQUIL. This can seriously harm and even kill an animal. Also, the speaker is a portable pa system from JYX, if anyone is interested. It was under $200, but I'm poor so I had to save for a bit. It sounds great for the money, though. I'm impressed and so are my neighbors.

 [/INST] 我是如何让那只不断吠叫的狗停止吠叫的。我的邻居三年前获得了一只狗。我们和他们共享一条围栏，它分离了我们的后院。这只狗吠叫吠叫，试图通过围栏咬我。我试图忽略它，轻声说话等，但这只狗是疯狂的。维护人员害怕它。因此，我去了邻居家那里，请他们帮助我找到让这只狗停止吠叫的方法。我现在无法使用我的后院了。这只狗每天都在外面，吠叫不断。我问他们是否可以通过围栏给它健康的食物？主人说不可以。我问他们是否我们可以共同购买一只非震击吠叫狗靴子？主人说不可以。（我向邻居家至少三次请求他们帮助他们的狗。） frustrated，但我还没有决定调用动物控制或任何其他行动。因此，我想出了一个计划。我买了一台非常好的可移动音乐播放器。这台音乐播放器非常昂贵，我保存了一段时间，投资了它。现在，每次我进入我的后院，我都带着音乐播放器。这里没有日间噪声规则，我检查了。当这只狗开始吠叫吠叫攻击围栏时，我的邻居（全部的他们）就可以享受一些 Lamb of God 或 Rotting Christ 或其他优秀的音乐，音乐播放器震动了桌子。很快，邻居们就能够两两相连。这只狗现在几乎在内部保持，当它出来时，它很快或主人随着它一起出来。邻居区现在非常安静了。注意：不要给狗任何人类药物，如泻药或 NyQuil。这可能会对狗造成危害，甚至可能会导致其死亡。如果有兴趣，音乐播放器是由 JYX 制造的可移动 PA 系统。它价格不到 200 元，但我很贫穷，所以我需要保存一段时间才能购买它。它听起来非常好，而且我和邻居们都非常满意。

When it comes to buying quality gear, a sleeping bag needs to be first on the list. You can scrimp on all manner of kit but not on a sleeping bag. A lot of your time when out camping or expeditions will be spent in your sleeping and with Snugpak you are assured quality. A tried and tested favourite, this British made sleeping bag combines micro pack size with serious performance. Many view the Softie 12 Osprey the ultimate four season synthetic fill sleeping bag available. Since 1987, it has been setting the standard for winter pack size performance for others to follow. Those who know about the Softie 12 Osprey have either used one or wished they had one. Used from the heights of the Scottish mountains to the bottom of your snow hole. The Softie 12 Osprey like many of our other sleeping bags in the Softie Original Series have been assigned a NATO Stock Number. The quilted top of the bag is tailored, pleated, and fitted with a drawcord so it pulls into shape, rather like a jacket hood. To prevent the 2-way zip from snagging either the zip baffle or the bag edges, an "anti-snag strip" of webbing is sewn in behind the zip. Liner Fastening and Hanging Tabs Inner tabs are provided to keep a loose liner in position, corresponding in position with the tabs we provide on our liners. External tabs allow you to easily hang the bag for airing and drying. Tapering the bag to a circle foot creates the "mummy" shape which is easy to warm and minimises the weight of material used. Hard to see in the picture, but a zip baffle runs the full length of the bag, behind the zip,to prevent heat escaping through the zip area. Buy a left and a right hand to make a double (please check when ordering) Comes complete with a compression stuff sack, to make the bag smaller when not in use. Can be used with the Snugpak Exanda Panel to make a wider sleeping bag for more comfort. This sleeping bag can be made extra long. Single profiled sleeping bag with one layer of softie insulation. Snugpak are based in a listed mill built in the 1800s on the edge of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. They are very proud to be one of the last manufacturers of quality sleeping bags and insulated clothing not only in the UK but across Europe. We have a dedicated workforce at our West Yorkshire factory in the North of England who are trained to use state-of-the-art machinery and traditional sewing techniques to bring our ideas to life. Contact Left Limited is an official supplier for Snugpak and carries a large range of their kit in our EBAY shop. Contact Left LTD is a leading supplier of kit to the Armed Forces and Close Protection Industry

I haven’t seen any comments from Australians yet, so I might as well say a few words. It’s difficult to find equipment that’s unique or out of the mainstream. Most boards are mass market boards such as sector 9s or Loaded Tan Tien’s … I have both and I’m not hating. If I want something out of the ordinary, however, I buy direct from the manufacturer or through Muir. Shipping is always a problem and it’s always expensive. I really wanted the Tortuga but when it was all priced up, it was over AU$500 (incl. shipping and exchange rate). Shipping alone was approx. US$100. I understand this isn't something you have control over … I only wanted to illustrate the considerations and trade-offs made from this side of the world. Finally, love your boards! Much respect.

I was scared that Covid was going to be worse. It wasn't, probably because I didn't get exposed to a lot of the virus, but it was bad enough. Still took months for my body to return to normal.

Scholz, Polish prime minister discuss migration, energy, EU Germany's new chancellor, Olaf Scholz came to Warsaw Sunday for talks with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki about migration, energy, European Union matters and tensions east of the bloc's border. He was greeted by Morawiecki, with military honors, in front of the Polish premier's office. It was one of Scholz's early visits after he was sworn in with his coalition Cabinet on Wednesday. Poland is a vocal opponent of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry Russian gas directly to Germany saying it makes Europe dependent on Russia's deliveries, and exposes it to pressure from Moscow. Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues. The government in Warsaw is also involved in an intensifying dispute with the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, which is withholding pandemic recovery funds from Poland saying the government's policies erode judicial independence there. Scholz and Morawiecki are also to discuss complex bilateral relations under Germany's new government. The good neighborly ties are still overshadowed by World War II, especially under Poland's current right-wing government, which is saying Germany owes Poland compensation for wartime damages. Agnieszka Lada-Konefal, the deputy director of the German Institute for Polish Affairs in Darmstadt, Germany, expects Scholz's government to continue dialogue and contact with Poland, which is an important member on EU's eastern flank and Germany's fifth-largest trading partner. The visit comes 30 years after the two parliaments ratified a treaty on good neighborly relations and friendly cooperation. Germany's new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, was in Warsaw on Friday. She voiced Germany's support for Poland which has sealed its eastern frontier to migrants who are apparently encouraged by the Belarus government to seek illegal passage. She also called for humanitarian treatment of the migrants stuck at the border. Poland and the EU say the government of Belarusian President Aleksander Lukashenko is seeking to destabilize the bloc by encouraging migration into its countries. On Friday, Scholz met with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and later with EU and NATO officials in Brussels. Scholz, a center-left politician, became Germany's ninth post-World War II chancellor, opening a new era for the EU's most populous nation and largest economy after Angela Merkel's 16-year tenure. His government is made up of a coalition of his center-left Social Democrats, the environmentalist Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats.

The Shuttlebays of the Enterprise-D The **Enterprise-D** of *The Next Generation* had **three** shuttlebays. On the show, we always see Shuttlebays 2 and 3 on decks 12 and 13. These two shuttlebays were represented by a full-size studio set that could house full-size shuttlecraft sets. I always loved it when episodes would showcase the twin shuttlebays at the back of the mid-section, neck, or whatever you want to call it. How come we never saw the main shuttlebay? It was located below the main bridge on decks 3&4 and would presumably be a massive facility. Instead of going there, the bridge crew would take a turbolift ride right past it all the way down to deck 13. In the original *Star Trek*, a miniature set was built and used with a miniature shuttle to give the shuttlebay life. Characters were sometimes seen talking by doors that opened into the shuttlebay with the miniature set and shuttle superimposed to give the ship scale and life. Couldn't they have done this on TNG? We saw Worf and Data launch a shuttle from the main shuttlebay in "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II," but the shuttle launch was seen from inside the shuttle. We simply see the wall outside the window as the shuttle flies out, quickly replaced by space. The only time we saw the shuttlebay in full scale was in "Cause and Effect." We see a space shot of the roll door opening, decompressing the main shuttlebay, and we get a quick glimpse of inside along with a few parked shuttles. Any ideas as to why the main shuttlebay was never seen outside these two instances?

I see it all the time in my line of work. And it doesn’t even have to be life or death to be frustrating. Had a recent patient who needed a very specific knee procedure to walk normally and improve quality of life. Peer to peer failed. Insurance says it’s not medically necessary. We appeal. They say no again. We go to third party appeal. We submit all the pertinent medical research supporting the need for the procedure. We even included the second opinion of a different surgeon outside of our program — yeah, he recommends the procedure. 24 hours later, they hit us back with the final “No. Not medically necessary.” My surgeon flips his shit and is like “FINE! But you’re going to fucking tell me which procedure you would recommend, because I don’t know another one that is gonna help this poor kid”. Of course, they don’t. And this kid is screwed. No other option. As it turns out this procedure is generally hated by insurance because it’s pretty expensive. We always have to fight for it, but they’ll usually agree after an appeal. Not this time. The system is so broken.

How was the farewell to Etho was like? First of a quick disclaimer: I am not the account user but her wife. I have permission to use this account because I just suck at tech and it kind of helps me with mental health issues (and I do see the irony of a technophobe asking about the redstone titan :P) Second and far more important disclaimer: I do not want to stir drama nor suspect something wasn't right. Afaik it was just a change of wind that didn't suit everyone. I'm just an old fan satisfying a nostalgia streak. With that out of the way >.<... So I used to be a huge Mindcrack fan back in the day. Never missed a release from GuudeBoulderfist, loved the collabs, etc. While watching a random YouTube feed, I came across a vid detailing Etho's channel history. Near the end, it touched on the Mindcrack going commercial. How he didn't see it in positive light and the inevitable refusal to sign the related contracts. Again, neither going 'pro' nor wanting to keep it casual is a wrong decision and I know people go in different directions and such. Quick Google led me to this old thread which shows his side of things. Mostly knowing things need to be carefully said, but what strikes most on face value is that you saw things in a different light but overall stayed on good terms. This whole story happened after I moved on to other things myself, so it's all kind of new to me. What I am after is the other side of the picture? As I said, my mental health isn't stellar, and seeing an old group I was attached to as a fan parting ways without some dumb explosions that are all too common in the polarized public discourse could be kinda nice and stuff. So how was the response from 'the old gang'? Did you keep doing stuff together? Did you slowly drift apart? Still chat or invite one another to events? Again, I'm not expecting anything dramatic or to see people at each other's throats. Kinda the opposite. I guess in a way, a form of low-key closure of something kinda small in my life to reflect a bit of positivity on my own mentally troubled butt. P.S. I couldn't help but see the charity fund raiser you had and the buttloads you collected. That's awesome as heck!

我们是否了解Etho的告别方式如何？首先，我需要做一个快速的 disclaimer：我不是该账户的用户，但我有权限使用该账户，因为我对技术非常恶劣，并且它对我的心理健康有所帮助（并且我可以看到该技术恶劣者向Etho提出的irony）。第二，更重要的 disclaimer：我不希望吸引争议，也不怀疑发生了什么不对。我只是一个老粉丝，满足了 nostalgia 的欲望。现在，我已经移动到了其他方向，因此该事件对我来说是新颖。我想了解Etho的另一方面？我说明，我的心理健康不太好，看到一些我曾经羁绊于作为粉丝的老群体分离，而没有那些常见的爆炸，可能会对我有所帮助。因此，我希望了解Etho与老群体之间的关系是如何？他们继续做事一起？他们逐渐分离？还是继续聊天或邀请彼此参加事件？我不期望发生什么剧烈的事情，也不期望看到他们互相攻击。相反，我认为这可能是一种对我心理健康有所帮助的低关键的闭合。

P.S. 我看到你们的慈善活动，以及你们收集了多少资金，非常钦佩。

It was prior to 2018. I got stranded by US Air in Philadelphia instead of taking me all the way to Newark, and me and a dozen other people were trying to get cars late in the evening. The counter people were the worst I have ever seen. A line out the door and they were taking breaks and talking about random non-work related stuff like we weren’t even here. I had a confirmed reservation went. After an hour of waiting, I told her what I had reserved and she loudly accused me of lying to her and told me off. I finally gave up and walked over to Hertz, who charged me a fortune, but they got me a car right away. I swore to never use Avis again. Worst car experience ever. National & Hertz have always been good experiences for me. Those two, followed by Enterprise. Enterprise wasn’t really bad in any way but they were never as convenient as National where I could walk up and pick out a car and drive away without waiting forever at a counter. I know these are anecdotal experiences but I’ll go out of my way to tell everyone to avoid Avis like the plague. It’s true that good customer service will keep customers loyal, and a bad customer experience will drive away 10 times as many more customer opportunities.

 [/INST] 以下是英文文本的中文翻译：

这是在2018之前发生的事情。我在Philadelphia被US Air留下了，而不是将我带到Newark，我和 dozen 名其他人一起晚上试图找到汽车。counter 人员是我曾经见到的最差的。队伍很长，他们在非工作相关的随机话题上谈话，就像我们不在他们面前。我有一个确认的预约，但是等待了一个小时后，他们告诉我我在他们面前的预约不是真实的，并告诉我离开。最终，我放弃了，走过去了Hertz，他们给我 charging 了很高的价格，但他们立即给我汽车。我永远不会再使用Avis。National & Hertz一直都是我好的经验。这两家，跟Enterprise一样，没有任何坏处，但是National比Enterprise更方便，我可以直接上去选择汽车并驾驶走去，而不需要等待长时间在柜台上。虽然这些是个人经验，但我会尽力告诉每个人避免Avis，就像疾病一样。好的客户服务会保持客户忠诚，而坏的客户经验会驱走10次更多的客户机会。

French fishermen threaten to disrupt British imports in post-Brexit fishing row French fishermen have threatened to disrupt British imports in an attempt to press London for more licenses as tensions escalate between France and the UK over post-Brexit fishing rights. The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months. France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year. The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough. Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests. "Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement. The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue. The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26." On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link. Several rounds of talks between the two sides have since been held but a durable solution has yet to be worked out.

This stuff withers when exposed to any critical thought. I'm not going to rule out that there are vast swaths of people who don't practice critical thinking, but either way, proving it wrong is no guarantee that it will wither. After all, we've already had a forensic audit and a hand recount of these votes, and that didn't help. Should we just keep allowing them to "audit" votes until they get the results they want? >This is letting Uri Geller try and pull his shit on James Randi. This is where the story ends and the lie goes to die. No, it's not. This is Uri Geller trying to pull his shit on James Randi, not liking the results, and hiring a company whose CEO has claimed he believes Geller's powers are real to "study" his powers and investigate whether Randi is a Communist who's trying to ruin Geller. If there are no results produced here, they'll ask for another audit. Or they'll claim that shredded ballots were fed to chickens that were then incinerated. >At some point, you have to do the actual work of looking at reality and comparing it to what they think and point out where they are wrong. We've already done this. Twice. It hasn't stopped them. And it's not like this is harmless. There are already allegations that these people are breaking federal law by not properly securing ballots. Also mentioned in that article: This company plans to physically canvas parts of Maricopa county to ask people if their ballots match. How comfortable would *you* be if someone showed up to ask you who you voted for in the last election, knowing that if you don't tell them, your vote might be flagged and discarded? How sure are you that this company is going to keep that data private, and not let others in your community know? And would you be as likely to vote if you knew that was a possibility every time? I know plenty of people who wouldn't.

 [/INST] 这些东西在任何关于批判性思维的挑战下会腐败。我不会否认有许多人没有练习批判性思维，但无论如何，证明它错误并不保证它会腐败。事实上，我们已经有了一次审查和手动计算这些投票，但这也没有帮助。我们应该继续允许他们“审查”投票，直到他们得到他们想要的结果吗？

>这是让Uri Geller试图欺骗James Randi的事情。这是故事结束，谎言死亡的地方。不是。这是Uri Geller试图欺骗James Randi，不喜欢结果，并雇佣一家CEO认为Geller的力量真实的公司来“研究”他的力量，检查Randi是否是一个试图破坏Geller的社会主义者。如果这里没有产生结果，他们就会要求另一次审查。或者他们就会声明被摧毁的纸张被鸡子喂食，然后焊烧。

至某个程度，你必须做出实际的工作，看看现实和他们认为的相比，指出他们错误的地方。我们已经做了两次。它没有停止他们。而且，这不是一个无害的事情。已经有人指责这些人违反了联邦法律，没有正确保护投票纸张。此外，这篇文章还提到这家公司计划在马里科普县的某些地区进行物理摸摸，询问人们他们投票的候选人是谁，如果他们不告诉他们，他们的投票可能会被标记为不匹配，然后被删除。你会感到舒服，如果有人来问你最近的选举中你投票的候选人是谁，知道如果你不告诉他们，你的投票可能会被标记为不匹配，然后被删除？你确定这家公司会保护这些数据的私密性，不会让你的社区人知道？而且，如果你知道这是可能的，你会更不可能投票吗？我知道许多人就不会了。

Time is running out for Iran nuclear deal, Germany says Germany's foreign minister warned on Saturday that time was running out to find a way to revive a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Iran, speaking after meetings with her counterparts from G7 countries. Talks have resumed in Vienna to try to revive the nuclear pact, with both sides trying to gauge the prospects of success after the latest exchanges in the stop-start negotiations. "Time is running out," German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock told reporters in Liverpool, England where G7 foreign ministers are meeting. It has shown in the last days that we do not have any progress. Baerbock said Iran had resumed the talks with a position that set the negotiations back six months. The current round of talks in Vienna follow a pause of five months after the election of a hardline anti-Westerner as Iran's president, Ebrahim Raisi. Earlier, U.S. officials said Secretary of State Antony Blinken had held a "productive" meeting with counterparts from Britain, Germany and France on Friday, discussing the way forward for the Iran talks. A senior State Department official said there was an "intense" conversation among the G7 countries, which were united in their position on the nuclear talks. "The statement will also be strong on the importance of getting Iran back to the table and that it is possible to conclude a deal but that the time is shrinking, so we're united in that," the official, briefing reporters on the condition of anonymity, said. The official added that U.S. Special Envoy for Iran Robert Malley was heading back to Vienna for talks. Iranian officials have previously said they were sticking to their tough stance. Under the original nuclear deal, abandoned in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump, Iran limited its nuclear program in return for relief from U.S., European Union and U.N. sanctions. The West fears the program would be used to develop weapons, something Tehran denies. Raisi said on Saturday that Tehran was serious in its nuclear talks in Vienna, the official IRNA news agency reported. The indirect U.S.-Iranian talks, in which diplomats from France, Britain, Germany, Russia and China shuttle between them because Tehran refuses direct contact with Washington, aim to get both sides to resume full compliance with the accord. The G7 meeting which is expected to result in a joint call for Iran to moderate its nuclear program and grasp the opportunity of the Vienna talks.

Aston Villa latest Premier League club to suffer Covid outbreak Aston Villa have become the latest Premier League outfit to suffer a Covid outbreak, with a number of positive cases discovered at the club. Sunday's training session at Bodymoor Heath was cancelled as a result, a session that was designed for just a small number of players' recovery after the loss to Liverpool on Saturday. It is not thought to be a serious outbreak at this stage, with The Athletic reporting that just one player has tested positive, with the rest being staff at the training ground. Villa face an away game at Norwich City on Tuesday night in the Premier League and there is no suggestion that it will be cancelled, with training also expected to go ahead as normal on Monday. The identity of the player that has tested positive has not been confirmed, nor whether it was any of the men who were involved against Liverpool. Manchester United have also suffered a Covid outbreak on Sunday and there seems to be more concern about that situation, with the Red Devil's trip to Brentford on Tuesday now reportedly under threat. Tottenham Hotspur have already been struggling with the virus, with their match against Brighton on Sunday postponed after eight players and five members of staff returned positive results. Championship sides West Brom and Queens Park Rangers have also suffered outbreaks and QPR's clash with Sheffield United on Monday has been postponed. Anyone who tests positive for the omicron variant of Covid-19 will have to isolate for 10 days, as will anyone who has been identified as a close contact of a positive result.

This is a different issue. Disabled people in America just aren't treated right, full stop. It doesn't have anything to do with income or living alone. Services and consideration for the disabled (as well as the poor) just aren't close to where they should be. We treat the disabled like crap. We treat the poor like crap. Everyone in the US should be ashamed. You're correct that our society needs to value human life more. If we did, we'd see these mass gun shootings go down. We'd see fewer traffic accidents and deaths. Health care and child care would be affordable and much easier access, and so on. Unfortunately, American society has "accepted" the statistics of hardship, deaths and other casualties as just "a way of life"...in exchange for "freedom" or some such BS. I see your comment about being disabled and not being supported as just another example of how America just doesn't support people. It's in the same vein as the author's point, not a conflict.

Organisations on high alert as techs race to fix software flaw A critical vulnerability in a widely used software tool - one quickly exploited in the online game Minecraft - is rapidly emerging as a major threat to organizations around the world. "The internet's on fire right now," said Adam Meyers, senior vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike. "People are scrambling to patch," he said, "and all kinds of people scrambling to exploit it." He said Friday morning that in the 12 hours since the bug's existence was disclosed that it had been "fully weaponised," meaning malefactors had developed and distributed tools to exploit it. The flaw may be the worst computer vulnerability discovered in years. It was uncovered in a utility that's ubiquitous in cloud servers and enterprise software used across industry and government. Unless it is fixed, it grants criminals, spies and programming novices alike easy access to internal networks where they can loot valuable data, plant malware, erase crucial information and much more. Cyber attacks are now seen as the biggest threat to financial stability. "I'd be hard-pressed to think of a company that's not at risk," said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer for Cloudflare, whose online infrastructure protects websites from malicious actors. Untold millions of servers have it installed, and experts said the fallout would not be known for several days. Amit Yoran, CEO of the cybersecurity firm Tenable, called it "the single biggest, most critical vulnerability of the last decade" - and possibly the biggest in the history of modern computing. The vulnerability, dubbed "Log4Shell," was rated 10 on a scale of one to 10 the Apache Software Foundation, which oversees development of the software. Anyone with the exploit can obtain full access to an unpatched computer that uses the software. Experts said the extreme ease with which the vulnerability lets an attacker access a web server - no password required - is what makes it so dangerous. New Zealand's computer emergency response team was among the first to report that the flaw was being "actively exploited in the wild" just hours after it was publicly reported Thursday and a patch released. The vulnerability, located in open-source Apache software used to run websites and other web services, was reported to the foundation on November 24 by the Chinese tech giant Alibaba, it said. It took two weeks to develop and release a fix.

There's a circularity to it... I think the meal boxes are an insane proposition. The math they do is just crazy. "We're actually saving money because we don't have to go out and buy a whole bottle of soy sauce to try Asian cooking..." Madness. I think that in the consumer space, cheaper goods at lower margins is the only reason that anyone outside of the upper class has experienced any sort of wage growth. Wages didn't really go up, but shit got cheaper. The problem is that we sold out the people below us. I agree with you. Some of us need to give up at least some convenience to make society better. Even if I'm not in the income level that would pay more taxes, I can still buy fewer things that are more expensive so that they can be made by people making a living wage and I can be willing to wait a few days to get it so that some gig worker doesn't have to be worked to the bone...

A dream to keep all children safe this Christmas Her brother (nearly two) had to be persuaded not to walk off with the baby Jesus. So there was the usual gentle chaos that attends any gathering of toddlers. But everyone was so pleased that it had gone ahead when so many other Christmas events have been cancelled as yet another Covid variant hove into view. My granddaughter is four which means that half her life - half her life! - has been blighted by the pandemic. Since she became properly aware she has known nothing but mask wearing, obsessive hand washing and keeping your distance. On several occasions (through various lockdowns) when I saw her I didn't know if I should kiss her or not. What kind of message does that send into the receptive, super-alert brain of a tiny child? I dread to think. I say this not as someone opposed to lockdowns or distancing. For all the criticism of our Government not a single nation has got it exactly right. It's been two steps forward, and one back (and sometimes the opposite) since the beginning of 2020. AND one knew - though many of us during those early sunny months rather enjoyed the luxury of not going out - that all over Britain there were those for whom being at home was hell not heaven. Children such as Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who became invisible with no school staff to ponder on why he was so thin and ill, no neighbours, no passers-by, no nothing.

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants. The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization. POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests. Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology. The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants. The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily. As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19. This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed. Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials. The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

Omicron变种可以在20分钟内检测：报告

韩国研究人员已经开发出了可以检测Omicron变种的分子诊断技术。技术的开发已经完成，但预计需要一段时间进行商业化。POSTECH于10日宣布，研究团队领导者Professor Lee Jung-wook的部门（化学工程）的研究团队已经开发出可以在20-30分钟内检测Omicron变种的分子诊断技术，并将结果在线发布。Omicron是一种包含26-32个突变的变种，用于感染细胞的Spike蛋白。研究团队指出分子诊断技术可以检测单个核苷醇基因的突变，因此可以检测“Stealth Omicron”，这些变种难以被PCR检测。目前，韩国中心疾病控制中心（KCDC）使用三种方法检测COVID-19变种：全基因组分析、目标DNA（如Spike蛋白）分析和PCR检测。在 Delta变种情况下，PCR检测可以检测，但Omicron无法检测。本次开发的技术不是一种读取DNA或RNA序列的检测方法，而是一种分子诊断技术。现有技术只检测病毒的特定区域，但分子诊断技术旨在仅当COVID-19RNA存在时发生核苷醇纤维结合反应，从而实现快速检测。Professor Lee指出Omicron对N基因在PCR检测中有强大的信号，但对S基因有弱大的信号。在“Stealth Omicron”情况下，N和S基因都确认阳性，使其与其他变种困难分离。分子诊断技术与PCR技术使用不同的机制，有效检测Omicron变种。与传统技术相比，该技术可以处理超过125个样本在30分钟内（超过250个样本每小时）。此外，该技术不需要专业设备，因此可以简单和易于制备诊断剂。由于该方法可以在4天内制备诊断剂，因此预计快速应对未来发生的新变种或病毒。Professor Lee说：“我希望这项技术的披露可以帮助我们尽快恢复正常日常生活。我们将快速检测和应对未来可能出现的新变种。这项技术目前还在商业化之前。然而，它可以作为当前情况下PCR检测Omicron未经开发的情况下作为辅助使用。Professor Lee说：“我认为这项技术将在下半年的第二半后进行商业化，需要临床试验。我披露这项技术的原因是为了与他人共享技术，开发更好的技术来克服COVID-19，并允许未发展的国家分析COVID-19变种。”

I told ya so.... The grocery store I worked at was undergoing a complete and total reorganization. Aisles were changing, and we were all learning where everything was. Needless to say, it was chaos. At the time this happened, we were pretty busy, and I had a line of customers, but Karen decides to skip the line to ask me where something was. I don't remember the exact item, but it was something like paper plates (or something that would be near them...plastic forks? straws?). Since I had a line of customers, I couldn't leave to help her locate, so I told her "I believe they are now on aisle 7." Before I can even get on my walkie to ask someone for sure, she storms off. Only to come storming back a couple of minutes later to tell me they are not there. A manager is now nearby, so I ask him if he can help her, and I tell him that I thought they were on 7, but she said they were not. He looks confused and says "OK, maybe they are on 8. I'll help you find them, ma'am." As they are about to walk away, she turns to me and says "You should know better than to tell someone where something is if you don't actually know". Long story short, she comes back to the checkout, but goes to another line. As the manager comes back, he leans in and whispers to me "They WERE on aisle 7, like you told her." HA....told you so!

Water heater temp and bath issue. My water heater is set pretty low. It’s a small tank in a closet (I live in an old pre-war apartment). Question is, it does fill the bathtub up all the way without going cold. If I only bathe once a week (but shower every 2 days or so) and the heater has enough water for quick showers, is it worth turning up the heat for the once a week bath? Or would I save more electricity heating up my stock pot on the stove and adding it to the bath once the water heater is emptied? Edit: Thanks everyone for the advice! I turned up the heat just a little and it did the trick. The comment about boiling being inefficient is probably correct bc even though the water heater is running continuously, that thing has SO MUCH insulation. It’s hard to get to so I’m leaving it at that temp and calling it a day.

 [/INST] 水浴器温度和浴池问题。我的水浴器温度很低。它是一个小容器，位于衣柜中（我生活在一个老式的预战期建物中）。问题是，即使我每周只浴池一次，但每两天或更频繁地洗澡，水浴器有足够的水量可以填充浴池完全，而不会冷却。是否值得提高温度，以每周浴池一次？还是每周浴池一次，而每两天或更频繁地洗澡，使用炉子加热水浴器中的水，然后将其添加到浴池中？编辑：感谢大家的建议！我提高了温度一点，它就可以了。洗澡的炉子可能不太有效，因为即使水浴器正在不断运行，但这个容器有很多保温。它很难到，所以我决定将其保持在这个温度上，并放弃它。

Iran reports lowest number of daily COVID-19 cases in more than one year Iran's Health Ministry has registered 1,686 new daily COVID-19 infections, the lowest tally over the past 460 days, marking a sharp decline in cases as the fifth wave of the pandemic subsides. According to Press TV, the Ministry announced on Saturday that 58 Iranians died from the disease, noting that out of the new cases detected over the past 24 hours, 286 patients were admitted to hospital. It added that 6,152,524 people in the country have contracted COVID-19 and 5,963,373 of the infected people recovered and were discharged from hospitals. According to the Ministry, 3,126 COVID-19 patients are in intensive care units (ICU) while 39,951,481 diagnosis tests have been so far conducted across Iran. Coronavirus figures have been on a downward trend since the government started a mass vaccination campaign. So far, 58,595,066 people have received the first dose of the COVID vaccine, 49,157,835 have received the second dosage and 2,237,841 have gotten the booster shots. The total number of vaccines injected in the country reached 109,990,742 doses. Over the past 24 hours, 19 provinces reported almost no death case or only one dead. According to the latest figures, eight cities are in the orange zones, 119 in the yellow category, and 321 cities are in blue zones. There is no city in the high-risk red zone. Iran's First Vice President Mohammad Mokhber said on Wednesday that the country is fully prepared to roll out coronavirus booster vaccinations. "Today there is neither concern nor any shortage in the supply of vaccine and the ground is ready for the third and fourth dose vaccinations," Mokhber added.

Free Training on CompTIA A+ | Will Cover Full Course I'm currently delivering free training on the CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 18 modules and I will be doing a dedicated video on each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since it will be a whole module in each video so please feel free to make use of the time stamps in descriptions if you're looking for specific topics only or just want to refresh on certain topics only. The time stamps are there to make life easier for you so it's your own fault if you end up skimming through the module back and forth like a crazy person looking for their lost teeth. I will make 20 videos for this course, the first is just the 4 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules. The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+, and the other courses I deliver should also be enough to pass the exams associated if there is a exam associated to that specific course. If you have a question about a specific topic in a module or the course in general that you would like more clarity on, please feel free to ask and I will try to assist you where I can if I'm online.

Each vintage leather bag is a totally natural and handmade product therefore the colors and the finish can vary from one piece to the other. Each bag has a unique antique leather / lightly distressed vintage leather look. Parts from several hides may be used to make a single leather bag. So there may be some variation in color and the textures to the different parts of a bag, which will create a wonderfully unique effect. Because of different craftsman and there may be small differences in the style, construction of the bags is shown on the website. The lining may be a lighter or darker colour to the one shown in the images. Please write to us to know the current stock color. Genuine leather might have very small cut / scars / mark on it. This does not mean it is damaged. There may also be visible creases in the leather. These features show the genuine origin of our leather satchels and messengers bags, they form part of the bag and do not affect its durability. Pure leather may smell a little when it is fresh but the smell will go away with use. Please keep it in sunlight and fresh air for a few days. There may be local customs / VAT charges which are unknown to us and beyond our control. Buyers are responsible for CUSTOMS at destination.

You know something. I get what Dave's point was. It's worse to kill black people than it is to make fun of trans people. And of course that's true. But Dave forgot something. Many people who hate trans people also hate black people. He hasn't endeared anyone to #blacklivesmatter. He's just given transphobes another hero and more anti-trans rhetoric. He's given credibility to transphobia. And considering the most vulnerable trans people are trans women of colour, he has made them a target for violence. He left his show because he realized that white people were laughing AT him, not WITH him. How he didn't realize he's done the exact same thing to trans people is very sad.

A Thief’s Pants Falls Down As He Attempts To Flee. So to note, I didn’t witness this. I was told this by co-workers at my first retail job. These two guys came to the store. One of them was pretty infamous in town for always being in trouble with the law. After a while of browsing, the infamous one left and went back to his vehicle while the other one took a shopping cart, and put a large 500 dollar socket set in it. This accomplice then waited until the two cashiers at the exit door were busy, then walked right by them and out the door. Both of them noticed, and asked each other if the guy paid. When it was confirmed he didn’t, one ran after him. I was told the cashier shouted for him to stop as she chased after him, but he began running with the cart to the getaway vehicle. I don’t know if he was one of those guys who liked wearing his pants low, or he didn’t have a belt on. But I was told his pants started falling down, and he was struggling to pull them up while running and pushing a cart with a heavy socket set. He then ditches the cart, leaving the socket set in it as he yanked his pants up, and ran to the getaway vehicle, jumping in with his infamous accomplice diving them off.

I'm in HR and have worked payroll in the past. If someone comes to me and tells me that they're working to get out of a financially abusive relationship and their abuser looks at their paystubs, we might be able to help! Depending on the company. I haven't had to do any of the below but I have had to keep staff off our directories and teach reception to pretend they didn't know who someone was and how to identify the abuser if he came by. I could make an arrangement to syphon money as an after tax deduction, give the deduction an incongruous name that makes it look like some sort of obligatory deduction and then "remit" that deduction back to you separately. I'd probably have to have you sign an agreement of course. Another thing I might be able to do: have a fake email conversation with you about why your paystubs are going missing or why your password isn't working (after you change it) and how we're "trying to figure this out, thank you for your patience!" We don't have this but some employers can issue all or part of a paycheck onto their own debit card, no bank needed. Also a lot of employers have various underutilized employee support services. These can range from counseling help, legal insurance, to discounts and coupons. It is worth asking what they have so you can take advantage of anything that helps. Some gyms let you rent lockers. Not an ideal place to hide stuff as theft is a risk, but it is an option that might work for some.

Amazing. But good on you. Yeah, when I was 16 I applied and got offered a job at a restaurant. Dishwasher. First shift they had me close. Saturday. We were working till past 1am. I quit the next day. Best way to lose a new young worker, by shocking them with that. Same happened to my friend after I had been working with Pizza Hut for a couple years (didn't make me close until months after I started working and trained up), got him a job there on the spot. They proceeded to put him on two closes in a row. He quit. Unless you advertise a job as a closing gig late at night, expect to lose your workers if you hit them with it too early.

Long queues for Banksy's shirts supporting statue-toppling protesters Crowds desperate to buy shirts designed by the mysterious street artist Banksy have been seen in Bristol, UK. They were released to support protesters on trial for toppling a slave trader statue during a Black Lives Matter march. Banksy designed the limited edition "souvenir shirts" to mark the trial of four people charged with damaging a controversial statue in Bristol last year. "All proceeds to the defendants so they can go for a pint," the artist wrote on Instagram. Sold for £25 ($33) plus VAT and limited to only one item per person at several shops, the shirt has been in such demand that people queued around blocks to get it. An almost two-minute long video posted on Twitter shows an endless line of customers. UK media reported that "thousands" were eager to raise cash for the protesters by purchasing the gray T-shirt, which depicts an empty plinth with "Bristol" written above it. It refers to a toppled bronze memorial to the 17th century merchant Edward Colston, who was involved in the transatlantic slave trade. The activists, known as the "Colston Four," are facing a trial at Bristol Crown Court next week, charged with inflicting criminal damage to a monument belonging to the city council. The men - who have all pleaded not guilty - are accused of sinking the statue "without lawful excuse." Praised by some for leaving money to various charitable causes after his death, the controversial trader's statue was attacked in June 2020, when a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement was happening in the city. The damaged plinth and graffitied statue was later recovered by the city council from Bristol Harbour, where it was thrown during the unrest, and re-emerged as a local museum exhibit, alongside a curated selection of BLM posters from the march. A sculpture of a BLM protester was erected on the empty plinth previously occupied by Colston.

Joe Biden Laments Failure to Stop Global Warming After Deadly Tornados President Joe Biden lamented the world's failure to stop global warming on Saturday after addressing the deadly tornadoes that swept through several states. "We all know that everything is more intense when the climate is warming. Everything," he said. "And obviously it has some impact here." At least 30 tornadoes were reported across six different states causing widespread devastation, and over 100 people are expected killed from the storm. The president said he did not know the full extent of global warming's contribution to the deadly storms, which he described as one of the "largest tornado outbreaks in history." He said he would get the Environmental Protection Agency to investigate. "All that I know is that the intensity of the weather across the board has some impact as a consequence of the warming of the planet," Biden said. The president praised the reporter who asked him about climate change. "As usual, you ask always the best question," he said with a wry chuckle. "How are we going to handle this?" he continued. "Part of it is acknowledging that the likelihood of fewer weather catastrophes, absent of continued movement on dealing with global warming, it's just not going to happen." Biden said he was shocked by the record wildfires in the country during 2021, expressing alarm that global warming was a major contribution. "So we have to act," he said. Biden said the first step was to save lives and care for the families who were affected by the storms. "I promise you. Whatever is needed. Whatever is needed, the federal government is going to supply it," Biden said. He said he would continue to monitor the storm recovery closely and do whatever was needed by the federal government. "I want folks in all these states to know. We're going to get through this. We're going to get through this together and the federal government is not going to walk away," he said. "This is one of those times when we aren't Democrats or Republicans." The president said he would visit the storm affected areas when it was clear he would not get in the way of local rescue efforts. "I do plan on going," he said.

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018. "I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010. "Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series. Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography. Rice's son, Christopher Rice, said he was at his mother's bedside when she died. Anne Rice will be buried in a private ceremony in New Orleans, with a public memorial planned next year, he said.

Apple Music Documents & Data Storage Size Recently, I made the switch from an iPhone 12 Pro to a 13 Pro Max, and on both iPhones I have noticed a bug that is eating up my internal storage. Apple Music’s Documents and Data are using about 35GB of internal storage. I have tried remediating this by deleting the app, but since this is a stock app the documents and data are never truly deleted from the iPhone. I thought that once I moved to the new iPhone 13 Pro that the bug would disappear, but that was not the case. After installing from an iCloud backup, I checked the Apple Music app and it was still using more then 30GBs for documents and data. After contacting two Apple Support specialists, one suggested that I wipe my iPhone and start fresh, while another didn’t offer any real suggestions as the issue goes beyond anything they can do. I also checked my iPad and it seems AM is only using 15GBs for documents and data on it, but that still is not acceptable. Now I am turning to the community to see how widespread this issue is, and maybe get Apple’s attention on this issue. Have you experienced this as well?

Why were Skyler and Walt Jr. so annoyed with Walt working on the house in season 2? Specifically 2.10 "Over" Walt replaces the hot water heater, then replaces boards that were apparently maybe not necessarily rotting. Why does Skyler seem so pissed about this? Fed up completely, she asks "Are you even going to work today?" A week or two prior, she was gung-ho about him resting and recovering the entire time. I understand she's unhappy in the relationship, but Walter Jr. seems vaguely annoyed and completely puzzled by Walt doing some renovations. I'm also aware Skyler is openly flirting with Ted in the hope that someone treats her as a priority for a change whilst carrying a child whereas Walt has made everything about him ever since his 50th birthday. Still, I always find it odd on rewatch that Sky and Jr. seem so incredibly ticked off that Walt is doing something productive at home, not lying or killing people or making drugs. Just fixing up the house like a homeowner would and should with nothing but spare time. I also understand this is just another form of desperation to attempt to retain his role as husband and family man despite a day or two prior forcing tequila onto his teenage son. He's clearly trying to get back in their good graces by hyping up an issue that isn't an immediate priority to make it seem like he's done a terrific job and is a terrific person! He clearly sucks at damage control. Regardless, the reaction from his wife and son still always rubbed me the wrong way and felt forced in this situation to try and highlight Walt's desperate bid to make up for ugly mistakes.

In some communities, the church provides a safe place for some persecuted social groups. It’s not a coincidence the civil rights movement was very much intertwined with minority churches, masjid, & temples. Ahmad Aubrey’s trial is also an example of positive impact. The Satanic Temple is also doing good stuff. However, examples where something is very wrong with the system has always been evident. Religious organizations and institutions should generally be held to the same standards as any other charitable organization. Transparency is the name of the game. Looking at cases like the Catholic Church, it might be advisable to ensure funds acquired by these tax-exempt religious organizations don't leave the country. When I think of religious memberships, perhaps a co-op model is useful; each member gets a single vote as a stakeholder. Hopefully, they are at least contributing to Social Security.

I think it's possible (but I don't know) they were telling them it wasn't safe to drive. When tornadoes get that imminent, the weather guys usually do that "Take cover now!!" thing because you don't know if it will be in two minutes or ten minutes or what. I don't know what right they have to actually forbid people to leave, but I could see where they would be telling them to take cover. Can you imagine all those people trying to get out of the parking lot when that touched down? They'd all have been killed. BUT if they were like "Keep working!" instead of "Take Shelter!", that's different. Does anybody know if they were still working or if they were sheltering in there somewhere?

Yes that means when I work out I really don’t care how many calories it burns, and I don’t change my numbers or macros because of how much I burned. I (try) to stick to the 1200-1300. But if I’m extra hungry, yes I’ll eat something more to fuel my body and accept that weight-loss might be a day slower, or not. If you’re already doing a 500 calorie cut, an extra piece of steak or even bread after a hard workout is not going to ruin your progress at all. It might just narrow your deficit that one day. An extra piece of pizza or bowl of ice cream though? That’s a no go. If you always need to eat more because of working out, consider not cutting so many calories in the first place. Maybe start with 300 deficit. Hope this helps!

PlanetJupiter finally left my office’s solar system I posted some years ago about my office nemesis, a woman called PlanetJupiter in my stories. Not much to say here. The last time I saw her before Corona, she had lost some weight and seemed to be paying a bit of attention to food groups when she ate lunch, though she was still using her power wheelchair and being a bit smelly. I asked how she is, like I ask all my co-workers if I see them. “Not so good, OP, I found out I have diabetes, so I have to eat fewer carbs.” To her slight credit, the lunch had cauliflower rice instead of regular. I am a Midwesterner, and have always been nice to PJ’s face, so I told her I was sorry, that sucked, what about this project we’re both on? Will she also work late to get it done for the court deadline? “Sure, OP. I am saving money to move.” This is really rare. My state has the lowest out-migration of any state, ever. Where is she moving? To another Midwest city that works a lot in the beef industry. I hope they didn’t mistake her for a steer! It turns out me and others documenting all her slow/bad work, falling asleep at the desk, annoying others, and smelling, has caused her to lose out on positions with all but one of the companies that often hires me, her, and others for contract work. So she sort of has to move to where family is in that city. She’ll go blight another workplace, but at least not mine. Not that it matters now, because I got a much better remote position.

Assam Anti-CAA Outfits Pay Tributes To People Who Died During Protests Five agitators were killed during the anti-CAA stirs in Assam two years ago. Several organisations in Assam on Sunday paid tributes to the five agitators who were killed in the anti-CAA stir two years ago, and resolved to resume the movement against the Act. Memorial meetings were organised at the residence of Sam Stafford, one of the agitators who died, and a playground in Guwahati, with attendees resolving to once again to intensify the stir against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which was among the first groups to organise protests against CAA after it was passed in Parliament, paid tributes to the agitators at Sam Stafford's Hatigaon residence. Sibsagar MLA Akhil Gogoi, who was a Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti leader during the stir and was jailed for his role in it, while paying floral tributes at the photographs of those who died, said that political parties and "nationalist organisations" must take the lead in resuming the movement. Commenting on the artiste fraternity that had taken the centerstage in the 2019 stir, he said, "We can't expect them to organise agitations. Their help is crucial but they shouldn't be blamed for not reviving the movement." All Assam Students' Union (AASU), another key player in the stir, organised a memorial at the Hatigaon Higher Secondary School playground. Speaking on the occasion, AASU chief advisor Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharya said, "It is wrong to say that the anti-CAA movement has died out. It had lost its intensity due to the commencement of examinations (in January 2020) and then the pandemic and lockdowns. We will resume the agitation with full intensity once again. We won't let the sacrifices go in vain," he said. Mr Bhattacharya said the anti-CAA agitation will once again be a pan-Northeast one like in 2019. Singer-music composer Zubeen Garg, who had taken a leading role in the 2019 protests, also paid his tributes at the programme organised by the AASU. "We won't accept the CAA and that is for sure. The government is trying to confuse us, but we won't allow them to make us accept it," he said.

This year's trend for a second Christmas tree in the bedroom sends sales of smaller spruces soaring Got just the one Christmas tree? Then you could be behind the times. This year's trend is for a second tree in the bedroom, and it has sent sales of smaller spruces soaring. More than a quarter of British homes now boast two festive firs, experts say - and it could be more than a status symbol. Both the soothing green colour and the pine aroma are said to be good for mental health and sleep cycles - while even fake trees can help evoke a feeling of nostalgia. Other families get two trees so children can decorate one as gaudily as they like, providing a place for any home-made masterpieces, while leaving a more elegantly garlanded fir on more prominent display to impress the neighbours. Among those buying into the trend, which started in the US, are Carole Middleton, mother of the Duchess of Cambridge, who gets a second tree for grandchildren George, Louis and Charlotte at her home in Bucklebury, West Berkshire. Last week, she posted on Instagram: "Once again this year we plan to have two Christmas trees: one for the children to decorate and one which I do myself." British Garden Centres said sales of smaller trees are up 50 per cent this year across its 58 sites. Director Boyd Douglas-Davies, who is also president of the Horticulture Trades Association, said: "People are trading up from a plant in the bedroom and putting in beautifully decorated trees." Fellow garden centre chain Squire's reports that 30 per cent of their customers plan on having at least two trees - and more than one in ten intend to have three or more. Chairman Sarah Squire said: "They give a bedroom a lovely, calming scent that is the perfect aid for a good night's sleep." Just as bedroom plants have been known to help mental health and purify the air, trees are also said to aid slumber. Sleep expert Carl Walsh said: "Our brains collect information from our surroundings and this translates into signals releasing hormones in response. In this instance melatonin and cortisol are the hormones that control your sleep cycle and put your body into a sleepy state." He added that a bedroom tree could also transport people back to a more carefree and youthful era. "Christmas can be a pretty stressful time. A bedroom tree takes people back to their childhood when they had no responsibilities and can forget about stressful things. That is always good for sleep."

France reacts to rival offer of US frigates to Greece The defense ministries of France and Greece have both confirmed that a competing offer from the US will have no impact on an already "signed" and "final" multibillion deal to purchase French Belharra frigates. France's Ministry of Armed Forces stated on Saturday that a defense contract with Athens had already been "initialled a few days ago," before the US State Department announced its approval of a potential sale of American frigates. Since we have been in discussion with the Greeks, the American offer is no longer on the table... We also signed the contract with the Greeks. Greece's Defense Ministry also confirmed that the deal with Paris was "final," since it had been negotiated at the "highest level possible" and "personally announced" by the Greek PM Kyriakos Mitsotakis. The finalized contracts are allegedly expected to be ratified by the Greek Parliament "soon." The US Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Friday it had approved the sale for $6.9 billion of four Lockheed Martin combat frigates, and a separate $2.5 billion program to upgrade Greece's MEKO class frigates. The announcement triggered some concerns over the Athens-Paris agreement, especially after a long-existing submarine construction "deal of the century" between France and Australia was abruptly tanked by a bombshell AUKUS pact in September, without any prior warning. Outraged Paris accused Washington and Canberra of a "stab in the back," while just two weeks later Macron took the stage with the Greek PM to personally announce the sale of at least three French warships to Athens for around $3.5 billion, saying it was time to "stop being naive" while touting the new deal as a sign of "Europe's strategic autonomy and sovereignty." This time around, according to the French military, the US "had warned us that this announcement was going to come out" and that Americans allegedly had "no inclination to go further" with an actual sale of their frigates.

Customer gets mad at me because I didn't know he needed help I work at a grocery store shopping for pickup/delivery orders. I often have customers ask where an item is and they ask in the form of a greeting + question, or just a question. I also have customers that just say hello/good morning/etc. I passed by a customer who said hello, and I said hello back, then waited a few seconds to see if he had a question. He didn't say anything else, so I moved on and continued shopping. He then said "hello?" again, in a rude tone, and asked if I worked here angrily. I said I did, and he asked where an item was, again in a rude tone. I pointed where I believed it would be located, and said that I thought it should be there but it looks like we were out of it. He then just said "forget it" angrily and walked away. How was I supposed to have known he needed help? He just said "hello" which plenty of customers say to be polite. This is the only customer I've had who has just said hello without asking a question, then expected me to know he needed help. He didn't say anything rude to me, but his tone of voice was extremely angry the whole time, even though I tried to help him.

Heavy snowfall wreaks havoc in Serbia and much of Balkans Heavy snowfall wreaked havoc in much of the Balkans on Sunday, disrupting public transportation. Flights were cancelled at Serbia's main airport in Belgrade on Sunday and many areas reported power cuts and damage to buildings. Much of western Serbia was without electricity as authorities warned against unnecessary travel and appealed to people in Serbia to conserve power. There was some damage to cars and buildings in Belgrade due to the snow. Several flights from and to Belgrade's main airport were cancelled because of the weather conditions and a brief power cut to the main terminal, Belgrade media reported. A highway leading to the airport was closed for several hours because of a traffic jam caused by the snowfall. Passengers on a local train to Belgrade were stuck in snow for seven hours before they were provided bus transportation to the capital. Emergency services have been assisting authorities in the cleanup operation, while another alert for more snow and ice has been issued. Meanwhile, in Bulgaria, heavy rains and major floods have been ravaging southern parts of the country over the weekend, forcing authorities there to declare a state of emergency. The worst-hit areas were in the Smolyan region, near the border with Greece, where rivers burst their banks to cause the overflowing of roads and the flooding of homes. Several trucks were trapped in a landslide on an intercity road. Strong winds disrupted power supply in dozens of villages, authorities said. Further south in Albania, authorities mobilised police, army and emergency forces to cope with floods following three days of continuous rainfall and snow. The Vjosa River in the south flooded many areas. An older couple who had stayed overnight on the rooftop of their house in southwest Albania was rescued by police in the morning. Many roads were temporarily blocked by landslides in the south. Elsewhere in the northeast and southeast of the country, heavy snow has hampered or temporarily blocked traffic.

Step 2: Call Store Manager if they aren't there. Step 3: Those that are at tills and anyone else really are free to wait a couple minutes to see if backup generators can get us going again. Step 4: Go throughout the store and getting every non employee to leave. As well as every cart brought to the front. Step 5: Go through the carts looking for anything cold and produce.

(Some were allowed to leave earlier, esp if they weren't comfortable in the dark or didn't still have 6hrs to go). It's really dark, even upfront. No way can we let customers just hang out. I'm not sure why some tills still had some power while others didn't. Not sure, but I don't think we had any way of having them pay. I do think items would scan, but no way would we trust the customers to pay later. One time it took only like 3 hrs for power to go back on. They had a few of us stay so if it did, as they were told by the power company it should, we could reopen. I don't mind, as long as we have the choice to stay or not, helping out preserving product as best as we could. Not having a choice, as well as endangering customers, is where I draw the line.

This Arab state plans to boost trade with Russia The United Arab Emirates plans to increase its trade turnover with Russia to $20 billion in the next five years, the country's Foreign Trade Minister Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi has announced. "We are working with the Russian side to increase trade turnover to $20 billion over the next five years and to continue investing in other areas [of economic cooperation]," Al Zeyoudi told RIA news agency on Saturday during a plenary session of the Expo-2020 international forum in the UAE, which had been postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. According to the official, "relations between Abu Dhabi and Moscow are strategic." He noted that up to 90% of all Russian investments in the Arab world are made in the UAE. The UAE also significantly invests in Russia, making up some 80% of all Arab investments in Russia's economy. "If we are talking about the number of Russian companies in the UAE, it has reached almost 4,000," Al Zeyoudi stated. According to the minister, the UAE is already investing in several Russian sectors, including the petrochemical industry, oil and gas, the automotive industry and ports, and it plans to broaden this list. In 2020, the trade turnover between the two states reached $3.3 billion, and in the first 10 months of 2021 its volume exceeded $4 billion, reaching a new record, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said last week. According to the Ministry of Economics, this year Russia mainly exported mineral products, precious stones and metals to the UAE, while Russian imports from the Arab country included machinery, equipment and vehicles.

Dallas Cowboys bring benches to Washington, rivalry heats up The visiting sideline at Washington has a familiar home look for the Dallas Cowboys. After getting word from other teams that the sideline benches at FedEx Field were in major need of an upgrade, the Cowboys brought their own for this showdown game. When they arrived at the stadium Sunday, they were already decked out in Cowboys logos and wordmarks. The Cowboys heard from the Seahawks, who recently played against Washington on a Monday night and had complaints that the heated benches were malfunctioning. Earlier in the week, Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott actually commented about the benefits of playing outdoors in colder games, because of the heated benches are beneficial to his knee injury. The Cowboys just made sure Zeke and his teammates got that opportunity. This move is just the latest twist in the Dallas-Washington rivalry, one that got juiced up even more this week when Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy predicted a win for his team, prompting some fireworks back and forth with Washington's Ron Rivera and players. Washington has beaten the Cowboys in consecutive matchups. It has been more than 30 years since it has defeated Dallas in three straight meetings (1986-88). Cowboys fans made up more than half of the crowd at FedEx field, which was evident based on the blue and white jerseys in the stands. Owner Jerry Jones foreshadowed that earlier this week when he said on 105.3 FM in Dallas, "We have always sold more Cowboys' hats, caps, T-shirts. We've always had our greatest fan support positive coming from Washington, that's outside the Dallas area. Outside the Texas area, Washington is where we have the most support of all when it comes to all the things you might count."

Warning of stormy weather as strong winds present 'danger to life' Storm force winds are set to batter northern parts of Scotland with disruption to travel, especially ferry services, expected. The northwest, Shetland and Orkney will face gusts of up to 85mph overnight on Sunday into Monday morning. The Hebrides, and western coast of the Highlands and parts of Argyll and Bute have been warned to be prepared for flying debris presenting a "danger to life" and causing damage to buildings. Experts are warning that the bad weather could lead to power cuts, road and bridge closures, and cancellations to air and ferry services. It follows two named storms, Arwen and Barra, that brought widespread disruption to large parts of the country. More than 100,000 homes had their power cut off by the extreme damage wrought by Storm Arwen on November 26 and 27. Storm Barra disrupted supplies to around 10,000 just 11 days later on December 7. STV weather presenter Philip Petrie said it was very nearly three in a row. The Met Office were keeping an eye on a low pressure system that is skirting along northwestern areas overnight on Sunday bringing with it very strong winds and squally, heavy showers. The Met Office has issued yellow weather warnings for wind with the first coming into force from 9pm on Sunday covering the Western Isles, and parts of the Highlands and Argyll and Bute. "Within this area there is the potential of gusts reaching 80-85mph causing disruption to ferries and also some damage and power cuts," Philip said. A further warning comes into effect at midnight on Sunday covering Orkney and Shetland. "This warning lasts until midday Monday as the centre of the low pressure system moves close to the Northern Isles, again bringing gusts of 80-85mph along coasts and locally in excess of 90mph in some areas," Philip said. "It is very fast moving though, so will clear away by Monday afternoon, with things beginning to ease and calm by lunchtime. For the rest of the week things will continue to settle ahead of next weekend."
