A very meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides my driver's license! Let's popularize it: Emergency first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures that are carried out before the ambulance arrives in the event of an emergency.
It is well known that there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the event of an accident. In fact, this period of time is the most critical. At this time, it is the time when emergency aid is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window for saving my life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So how important is it for people around you to know first aid! When someone collapses near you, you can use your professional knowledge to perform CPR and save their life, rather than standing there helplessly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is truly terrifying. "In China, our official data shows that there are 3 million annual deaths due to accidents, and the most dangerous is sudden cardiac arrest."
In the United States, on average, 15% of people can be saved. In casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, 70% can be saved. In Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1% can be saved. This is what the founder of the first response said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, performing CPR on the person is useless. Only by performing artificial respiration and chest compressions can the person be saved. I have found that many people do not have the awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when an emergency arises, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill and let us be able to respond quickly in the event of an emergency.
It's uncertain whether we can save a life! Emergency certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students. PS: The last photo is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25, and adding the emergency certification to the goal list is something I did a few months ago, but I have actually completed it!
After that, I plan to take the other certifications I want to take, and I want to take a diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving emergency certification, and it seems that you need an emergency certification to take this certification, so an emergency certification is still very useful!

The Chongqing Municipal Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system. Students who enroll are considered trainee employees of the pilot enterprises. According to a report from the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission yesterday, starting this year, the city will pilot the modern apprenticeship system in 60 vocational schools, and students who are admitted will be pre-recruited as employees of the pilot enterprises. The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of vocational school students and trainee employees should be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For students who have not yet reached the age of 18 and are over 16 years old, the agreement must be signed by the student, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits for on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-type forms of cooperation with enterprises in conducting pre-employment training and on-the-job training for employees. Pilot schools should reform their talent training models. Schools and enterprises should jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Pilot the vocational education as a pilot period, and students' internship time will be determined according to the vocational talent training plan in the enterprise. Generally, the top internship is 6 months. In the enterprise practice, implement the team-based management mode, and according to the different characteristics of different majors, one teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation internship position. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, the city has determined 60 city-level modern vocational apprenticeship pilot projects, with each pilot project having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) have been trained.
According to the principle of starting from a pilot and gradually promoting it from point to surface, explore the long-term mechanism of establishing school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integration of talents, in order to effectively enhance students' job skills and improve their employment rate and quality.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and in the end, it is ruthless and cuts corners. The dust suction effect is not bad, and the amount of dust in the house is significantly reduced. However, it is a bit heavy when holding it with one hand.

South African doctors: Omicron's spreading power is strong, but most cases are mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant. Although the spread of Omicron is faster, doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province report that the symptoms they are currently seeing in COVID-19 patients are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's chief physician, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said, "They can control their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He added that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are more prone to contracting severe COVID-19 due to their underlying health conditions.
He said, compared to the previous wave of Delta COVID-19, in the treatment of new coronavirus patients, "they had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks of time, the doctor's observation and early evidence have provided some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic. The average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent cases of COVID-19, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of the disease in South Africa was 20%. The Director of the African Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying: "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early. We need to obtain post-epidemic data. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only entered this wave of the epidemic two weeks ago." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the main strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being at the center of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%, and tests showed that over 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.

Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, delivered a speech on the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial Party Congress at the Video Creative Park in Mashan Mountain, Changsha on December 10th. According to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Committee, Yang Haodong, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and the Secretary of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Committee, delivered a speech on December 10th morning at the Video Creative Park in Mashan Mountain, Changsha. He deeply studied and implemented the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on important issues in Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haodong, from the aspects of idealism, beliefs and values, self-revolution and the Youth League, as well as the Party's leadership and theory, comprehensively and systematically expounded the core spirit and practical requirements of the conference from his own insights and experiences. He emphasized the need to integrate the spirit of the conference and the important speeches, instructions and directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the development of Hunan, and to practice the concept of "two establishes" and "two safeguards" with a sense of political self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action-oriented self-consciousness, unswervingly following the direction pointed out by General Secretary Xi Jinping. During the interactive exchange segment, grassroots party branch representatives, business representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishes", how cultural enterprises should seize the opportunity, and how new generations can draw strength from the century-long history of the Party. Yang Haodong answered each question in plain language with vivid examples, urging young
According to a report from the New China News Agency on December 11, 2022, the number of graduates from universities in Beijing is expected to reach 268,000 in 2022, an increase of 16,000 compared to the previous year. At the 2022 Beijing University Graduate Employment and Entrepreneurship Work Video Conference held by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau, it was announced that the number of graduates from universities in Beijing is expected to reach 268,000 in 2022, an increase of 16,000 compared to the previous year. The relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau said that they will deploy employment work for Beijing university graduates from the aspects of strengthening supply and demand matching, enhancing policy support, expanding employment channels, ensuring difficult assistance, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving service efficiency.
Reporters have learned that the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will establish a practice platform, increase job placements, and actively contact 40 universities' graduate employment experience bases, visiting units, and integrating demand and job information.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the courier's mistake. I can't investigate further.
I hope you all understand.
Because the delivery time was displayed as being faster by 30 minutes than it actually was, thank you.
Yes, he has changed his rider and has been waiting for a long time. The restaurant has been saying that they are processing it.
Waited for a few hours.
I have already taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
Original text:  原来要 #NUMBER# 那总之我不叫了  Translation:  It turns out that #NUMBER# in the end, I didn't call you.
If I don't eat, I will definitely sue you and you won't be able to send it, why didn't you say it earlier?
Wait for you so long.
No, I haven't received the call. Please notify them and have them send it to our company.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
A meal has been waiting for half an hour, and it has not been delivered yet. I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the chicken you ordered from the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar-priced beginner's racket first. In fact, the price is often correlated with the level of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then a high-priced racket will be more friendly than a low-priced one. This type of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial waste. Its strength is very low, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control.
The logic and hidden agenda behind it is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll sell you some cheap junk and you won't play anymore after two tries. This way, the cheap racket is good enough, and you won't feel sorry for yourself. When you can really tell the difference, it means you've improved, and when you come back to buy a good racket from me, I'll earn twice the money. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money and buy a second-hand racket from Prince or Donnay. These brands don't have a reputation, so good rackets are hard to sell at a higher price. A new racket for 500-600 yuan is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200 yuan is still enjoyable, isn't it?
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once the newcomer stage is over, I become arrogant. However, most people, especially women, cannot pass the newcomer stage.
Can you help me follow up on the order that has been delayed multiple times for delivery? Delay.
Thank you.
That's to say, in fact, I already have credit?
Can I place a new order now? Do I need to ignore the previous order?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but when it arrived, it was missing a lot of ingredients and the chicken was raw.

According to a recent report from the Xinhua News Agency, the Jiangxi Province in China plans to train 10,000 rural elementary school music, art, and physical education teachers within the next three years to strengthen the teacher team and promote balanced development of rural compulsory education. Starting from 2016, the Jiangxi Province will allocate three years to train one music, art, and physical education teacher for each rural elementary school (village and below) in the province, with a total of 10,000 teachers to be trained. The training objectives are rural elementary school teachers aged 45 or below with music, art, and physical education knowledge or talents, who can also teach other subjects in addition to music, art, and physical education.
Through training, they will acquire basic knowledge and teaching skills in the field of aesthetics, update their teaching concepts and ideas, master modern teaching methods, enhance their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of multi-skilled music and aesthetics teachers. This will help alleviate the problem of shortage of rural music and aesthetics teachers. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi has planned to train one music, art, and sports teacher from each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, with a total of 300 trainees. This will comprehensively enhance their teaching exemplary leadership ability, teaching research activity design ability, teaching ability, training ability, and ability to participate in online training workshops, and play the roles of teaching, exemplifying, guiding, and supervising.

I don't want the food I made 1 hour ago.
I found the buyer for the previous incorrect order, but my car wheel is missing.
Hello, how long will it take for the ordered food to be delivered?
Your rider's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#. Could you please give them a reasonable explanation?
Yes, but your rider has some problems. Please handle it well.
Can you check if they are still on the way? If they are, it's best to send them. If they're not, return the deposit for the reservation.
In fact, paying attention to the clothing and accessories for thin girls is quite a lot. For fat girls, the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, just covering the fat part of the thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
Wearing clothes that are too long can give the impression of being short and stout. If you wear clothes that are divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, it will give the impression that you have naturally grown taller. For example, using different colors for the top, skirt, and ankle-length socks can create a sense of length. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard outfits for pear-shaped women (the author has a deep understanding of this point), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body's fat. Elegant and refined black short dresses are the first choice for pear-shaped women.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look thinner. If you have fat legs, don't draw attention to them by wearing attention-grabbing socks and shoes. The more mainstream and toned down the color, the better.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make people feel fat. For slightly chubby girls, it is necessary to learn the rules of clothing coordination. Chubby girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the upper body should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black ankle socks or mesh socks (with fine grids, please), choose a soft floral print skirt that covers well, and match a loose-fitting top with a ruffled collar, which can effectively cover the flaws of chubby girls.
Of course, even thin girls wearing short skirts also require attention to detail. Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will enhance the effect of making you look taller. Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer combination!
If you are pear-shaped and have thin legs but a big belly, it is recommended to choose a beautifully designed short skirt. Not only can it conceal your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A letter-shaped skirt will look very slimming, which is more suitable for pear-shaped girls. When choosing an upper garment, choose something that is tight-fitting to create a layering effect, which will make you look even slimmer.
Translation:  Match a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt, even pear-shaped girls can try. Thin girls can also create a stylish look. As long as you can master the dressing rules, pear-shaped girls will also be the focus of everyone's attention.
There have been changes in clothing and accessory coordination, and it's important to exercise more in daily life to try to escape the "fat girl" label earlier in the day 😄

The appearance is beautiful and eye-catching, and the configuration is also very good for giving to the nephew.

Is there only one order for shrimp dumplings? Why do you have six copies?
I'm not going, I'm just following the delivery order. I haven't been contacted for an hour, this is definitely online fraud.
You think this is my first time ordering takeout? After the investigation, it turns out you's right! Before placing the order, I checked the address several times to make sure it was correct. Thank you! How many days is it?
From 7:00 am to now 9:30 am, none of them have been sent, you must return the deposit and cancel the order.
The Lamborghini flagship super sports car, Murcielago's successor model - Aventador LP700-4, is the ultimate dream car for many men! This time, our team brings you the latest news from the new district of Shenzhen, where the exhaust sound is the loudest!
The car is priced at around two hundred thousand yuan, and the annual road tax is several thousand yuan. It has four wheels and is driven by a 700 horsepower engine. Why is it called LP700? Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? I don't know either, but the data says it can accelerate from 0-100km/h in just 2.9 seconds. By the time your Myvi reaches 30km/h, they will have already reached 100km/h. Haha.
The low-slung body, the flamboyant scissor doors, the massive air intakes all around the car, and the glass that provides an unobstructed view of the 6.5 V12 engine perfectly embody the Lamborghini style. There's no need to say much about the car's description, just Google it and you'll find plenty of information. I've summarized some of the information that Google may not have provided. It's so eye-catching that everyone is staring at it wherever it goes, which is a bit embarrassing, but also kind of exhilarating! (In reality, it's a bit refreshing.)
1km oil cost around M1 (the car owner doesn't care). Practice getting out of the car from this position, otherwise it will be a bit embarrassing (because you may not be able to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud after getting out of the car, which will cause sudden deafness. (But it's still enjoyable)
The car is too big to stop at a regular parking spot. It will be very narrow and I am afraid that when the car next to me opens the door, it will hit me! I feel a little lonely because there is no opponent on the road (I am talking about myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha). Please do not misunderstand, this super racing video is not for sale. I apologize!
For friends who want to shoot videos of your car, welcome to contact us! More car news that you don't know, can be found in The Car Guide / People's Car Encyclopedia!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911's price is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, a Porsche 911 and a Bugatti Chiron were involved in a collision in just a few seconds, resulting in both cars being totaled! It seems that there is some truth to the saying that "expensive cars are more likely to be involved in accidents!"
I ordered a meal and there were 2 items sent wrong.

Yes, the order is in an accepted state, but the restaurant called to say that the rider cannot deliver the bones, so the restaurant needs to cut the meat and bones apart and discard the bones. Do you understand my question?

According to a special report from the Xinhua News Agency on May 19, 2023, students in Guangxi can take up to 5 years off from their studies to start a business. The report, which was obtained by the reporter from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department, states that starting from the upcoming academic year, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, allowing students to extend their leave of absence for up to 2 to 5 years to start a business while still in school. The time spent on starting a business can be counted as practical education time. In order to enhance the entrepreneurial and innovative abilities of university students, the departments of education, human resources, and others in Guangxi are working together to build an entrepreneurship platform, construct more off-campus practical teaching and learning bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, providing external support for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of each university's innovation and entrepreneurship practice base should reach 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and 2,000 square meters for vocational schools. The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship education departments and prioritizes supporting outstanding students who transfer to specialized majors in this area. University teachers should spend at least two months on internships in industry enterprises every two years to enhance their awareness and capabilities in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The education bureau of the autonomous region requires all universities in Guizhou to deeply implement the plan for training college students in innovation and entrepreneurship, and strive to ensure that every college student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their schooling. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.

Visual wedding photography base (Hebei store) currently does not have a branch of wedding fashion avant-garde, makeup artists are also top-notch, photography techniques and angles are also called a professional, the shooting effect is very good. A very reputable seller with excellent service attitude.
The makeup and hairstyle are very exquisite, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very enjoyable, and the professional team made me feel very satisfied. The seller's service attitude was also very good, and they introduced me to their friends. I will definitely recommend them to my friends. Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist for allowing me to have a unique wedding photo. Thank you to all the staff who worked on the wedding photo today, and I look forward to the release of the final product.
Shooting wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for photographers who are constantly running and jumping. The makeup artist was very thoughtful and helped me design a makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer was humorous and lively during the shoot, making it a fun and enjoyable experience. I am grateful to my photographer and makeup artist for allowing me to see myself looking so beautiful in my wedding photos.
Praise the bride, her eyes are beautiful, her figure is tall and proportionate, she looks like a virtuous wife and a good mother. In the future, she will live a thrifty and frugal life. The groom must have earned enough, he will live a happy life with his beautiful wife. The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what is said online, we look handsome and beautiful in the photos, we are very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude was also very enthusiastic. This time, not only did we admire the beautiful scenery, but we also took beautiful wedding photos and met this friend who is a photographer. The wedding photos are so beautiful that they blew up the photographer and makeup artist. You guys are really super professional.
Thank you, Miss Mu, for your patience and meticulous guidance. I really like the photos you took of me. When I saw the wedding dress photo, I didn't recognize myself at first. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have a wedding photo that is as good as a celebrity's.
Taking wedding photos is more important than just the photographer and makeup artist being aesthetically pleasing. Fortunately, I was able to find someone who was both. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I had also been "deceived" by them.
A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint.
The chairman of this organization, Wan Yuchong, said at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three schools has basically remained the same. Many studies have shown that these top schools discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process through "comprehensive consideration". Wan Yuchong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate compared to all other ethnic groups.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and request that the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions. They also hope that the schools that are being sued will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.
Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously sued Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese American community, other groups such as the Indian American, Japanese American, Korean American, and Pakistani American education organizations have also participated in the lawsuit.
Why is the order still being executed even though the utensils were just canceled?
"Can you help me check if it has been canceled?"
But I placed the order at 5:09 am this morning.
On the other side is the takeout hotline. They don't know what they're saying, is there a phone number we can directly contact them with?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province, from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building. In December 2020, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member Lin and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring the money through a bank. Lin signed the "Factory Building Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the recipient of the deposit, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agreed to sign the factory building purchase and sale agreement within a week.
However, after the two parties failed to reach a consensus on issues such as the scope of the factory and the payment method in the sales contract, the house purchase contract was delayed and could not be signed. Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin decided to refund the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After finally finding a house that he liked, paid the deposit, and was ready to pay the balance, he was just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller refused to sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court. The court after reviewing the case found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not required to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract and returning double the deposit. After the first-instance ruling, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment. [Legal Advice] In the trading process, it is necessary to exercise due diligence. As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence in the signing of the contract, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information, and clearly stating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

It's rare to find a seat at a restaurant, and the quality of the menu items hasn't changed, still as good as ever. The taste is praised for the meat dishes, and the main dishes from Nanchang outside delivery are also highly recommended.
Food: This meal was a bit disappointing. Three bowls of chicken: The side dishes were a bit too much, and the chicken meat was a bit too little. The main taste was a bit off, the bottom taste was not salty enough, which made the sweet taste more prominent. Everyone can add some sweetness and various seasonings to complete the dish.

If it is not possible to change the store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?
Then I don't need to give you more money, right?
The order for my colleague has already been delivered, but the GPS tracking is not working. What should I do?
Golden Lady Wedding Photography (South Street Store) temporarily does not have a branch for taking photos. Before the photoshoot, we did not arrange the time properly and changed it twice. Our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.
The staff of Madame Gold, whether they are advisors, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised. It was my first time having a formal makeup done, wow~ I can't believe it, one day I will look just as good too, haha. Jiaqi and another sister (sorry, I can't remember her name) did my makeup with great patience and it looked very natural.
The outdoor photoshoot was in Wuxi City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and quickly arranged them if they looked a little messy. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy throughout the day. When we were choosing the photos, we didn't want to delete too many photos online, but we didn't add any extra photos during the selection process. We just chose the 24 photos included in the package and didn't add any extra ones (I heard that my cousin who had a wedding dress photoshoot charged over 7,000 yuan for a package that included over 10,000 photos, which surprised me and made me afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were retouched and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at two that I didn't think were very good, and they immediately helped me re-retouch them. I turned over the photos my sister took before and compared them, and I was really satisfied with our photos. They are simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuan Han Jin Fu Ren to take their wedding dress photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan. Dear wives, I sincerely wish you all a happy and prosperous life. May your future be as bright as silk! How much is this package?
What conditions must be met for $32 to be used?
Alright, no need to refund.
Your driver says he can't find it, but I still don't understand what he's saying in English.
Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the translation:  "那我要退回咖喱汤底给你吗？"  Meaning: "Can I return the curry soup base to you?"
I only received half of it, and I haven't seen the other six boxes yet.
The company is working overtime, and they haven't eaten lunch yet. They want to order food for delivery, but they don't know that their order will be canceled.
You are called Zhen Ming, and this is your second week in Japan. You are walking on the street when suddenly you feel someone following you. You become afraid and start running faster and faster until you finally run away. The person chasing you calls out behind you: "Miss! Please wait!". You stop at the convenience store entrance.
Miss... I am a director, and I think you look very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show? You are very surprised and afraid that this might be a scam. He gives you his business card, and you find out that he is a director from a large entertainment company in Japan.
Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company and talk. The fee will definitely not be too high.  You hesitated for a moment and then followed him to the company. He said he had seen you on the street and was very eager for you to join. You thought it wouldn't be a loss and could earn some money, so you signed the contract.

I don't think I can accept an order that takes more than 20 minutes to arrive and hasn't been sent yet.
3200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the special paper running out. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the special anti-forgery paper ran out in early October, it has not been able to issue birth certificates to newborn babies, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200. However, the department's director, KRU Amins, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the anti-forgery paper arrives next week.
At a news conference, he addressed the issue of a 10-month-long newspaper report on the problem of counterfeit paper production in Sabah. He explained that the problem had arisen two months earlier and that Sarawak was also facing the same issue. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory producing special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in the delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRUAMINUS revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work. "The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to take stock, and the final printing will be done in Sabah immediately after. It is estimated that it will be ready for delivery to the applicants by December 20th."
We will inform the applicants to go to each district office to pick up the birth certificates. He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Isn't it already past 7 o'clock? I'm talking about food.
I am facing #PRS\_ORG# across from me.

Where is the self-pickup location? I can't see the address.
Download the SUNING YiBuy app to follow SUNING's WeChat public account and save money on purchases. Earn money by sharing with others.
It is very convenient to download the SUNING Financial APP and follow the SUNING Easy Shopping service number. It is just as easy as opening it on a computer, and it has solved my problem of insufficient hard disk space on my computer.
The newly arrived solid-state mobile hard drive cannot be recognized by the mobile computer, but it can be recognized by the computer using a USB drive. The machine is lightweight and has a stylish appearance. I used it this afternoon, and the heat dissipation is very good, and I basically didn't feel hot. The running speed is fast, and the boot time is 99% for most users.
The battery is also powerful, with a standby time of 9 hours. With a usage time of 4 hours, there should be no problem. Overall, this price can buy a machine of this quality, and I feel very happy. Other functions will be discovered later, and I will supplement them later. The appearance is very good. In terms of performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a while.
The machine is fast, bigger than I imagined, with a lot of rendering effect pictures, I like it, I will use it for a while and give a review later. In Hong Kong, I found the serial number of the machine, and the quality should be okay. It doesn't feel too big, but it's heavy, and it's not easy to hold with one hand. It's a bit bigger than 15.6 inches, but it runs smoothly and stably. I don't feel any lag, and I love the sound of the fan blowing hot air. It's very satisfying, and it doesn't make a constant noise like a game console.
The goods are good, much cheaper than the official flagship store, and they even came with a backpack. I think it's great. The service from the store is also good, they reminded me to update my BIOS and promptly issued a warranty. Definitely worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation is very good, with almost no temperature. Lightweight level: Convenient for carrying. Material of appearance: The traditional design of ThinkPad is satisfactory, and the reputation of the seller is trustworthy. Carefully check the appearance of the entire machine, and there are no signs of refurbished or used items, which confirms that it is a brand-new machine with the same configuration as the page. I forgot to bring a backpack, but the seller immediately provided me with a backpack, although it was not the original factory backpack, but the service and follow-up were good enough to prove that it was a seller with integrity.
If you need to buy a notebook and return it later, the exterior material should be stylish and have a good display effect. The screen resolution should be sufficient, and the screen should be clear. The weight should be relatively light, as heavier things tend to feel better. The heat dissipation effect should be evaluated after trying it out initially.
Keyboard typing is not bad, and it comes with a mouse and a converter. This configuration is more cost-effective than domestic ones, and overall, it's a good deal. The machine is affordable and the screen is comfortable to use. I'll do a review after using it for a while.
Education News: The proportion of gifted students in Beijing's 2016 middle school entrance examination was reduced. According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency on January 21st and 22nd, the work of organizing the middle school entrance examination for gifted students in Beijing was unified by each district education committee. This year, the admission ratio of gifted students in Beijing's various districts has been reduced, and the competition among gifted students has become more intense.
Using Beijing's Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of primary and middle school students with special talents entering high school does not exceed 5% of the total planned enrollment of the district, and the planned enrollment is 380 people.

The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Firmly believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during a special period - Xinhua Net, Sarajevo, December 11, 2021. The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, recently expressed his strong desire for the Beijing Winter Olympics, firmly believing that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during a special period. Yesterday, the Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, in the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
At the meeting, Kweichow Xi enthusiastically evaluated the relationship between China and the United States and expressed his belief that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during special times. He recalled his visit to China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and was deeply impressed by China's excellent organizational work. He is confident that China will be able to host a great Winter Olympics. The delegation from the United States is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Olympic Committee is actively organizing the event. They hope to use this opportunity to expand exchanges and cooperation in the field of sports with China. Yici said that there is a special "Olympic belt" between China and the United States. The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and in two months, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will open, presenting the world with a simple, safe, and spectacular event.
The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to deepen cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the preparation and training of athletes for winter sports events, and to promote cultural exchanges between the two countries. The embassy also wishes to use the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote cultural exchanges and let the people of both countries "move towards the future" together. The embassy also congratulates Bosnia and Herzegovina's athletes on their achievements and wishes them success in the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics.  Prior to the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony. Tian Ping, as a special guest, presented the award for Best Young Athlete to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The event featured a looped playback of promotional videos for the Beijing Winter Olympics.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control work in border cities. The notice requires that people who leave land border cities (excluding those with a border with Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test result, and after arriving in the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the border city range and announcing it in each province, autonomous region, and municipality, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, it is noted that under certain conditions, cities at the border can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction. The National Health Commission's Office of Disease Prevention and Control has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent exchange between the two sides of the border. Implementing differentiated management policies based on the division of regions can turn the first line of defense from one to two lines, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.
Recently, there have been several domestic cluster-type epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemic areas through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as delayed and inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, poor implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formalism in regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of cold chain items at various nodes, inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies. The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the mechanism of border city epidemic control, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control work of border cities, and to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work in a rigorous and scientifically accurate manner, to tighten the defense line against the import of epidemics.
Notice emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the study and deployment of epidemic prevention and ensuring people's livelihood work, publish and publicize the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, regularly check and resolve hidden dangers in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices, and promptly respond to and proactively address prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notice, the border cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the prefecture-level cities, autonomous regions, and municipalities where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on epidemic prevention needs and announced in a timely manner.

The truth about the 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree by the US military - Xinhua Net (source of the video: oil pipe) December 11, 2021, an oil pipe platform micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" caused widespread attention.
This film tells the story of how the United States, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, launched a war in Afghanistan and forced the export of American-style democracy. Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has become brutal, bloodthirsty, and addicted to killing innocent people, committing countless crimes against humanity. They have used drone strikes to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, twisting human nature and establishing a killing squad. Over the past 20 years, the U.S. military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has established "black sites" to subject "criminals" to various forms of torture and humiliation. One after another, anti-human crimes have aroused more hatred among Afghans. As the video says, the US "war on terror" is becoming "more and more terrifying".
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan. Instead, it has brought only a country full of scars and destruction, and countless killings. Let's watch the video together and expose the truth behind the United States' so-called "anti-terrorism" bloody killing spree, tear away the false face of American-style democracy!
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it cooled down, it became hard and brittle, making it impossible to eat. The soup also spilled out.
Immediately cancel it. The things sent by #PRS\_ORG# must have cooled down by now. I haven't even taken them yet! #NAME# said that no one went to pick them up.
If you don't refund the money we talked about on the phone, I'll call the police.
Several times using #PRS\_ORG#, today's experience is the worst and completely unacceptable. It can be improved.
But also remind the restaurant and the driver to avoid happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time, but it keeps delaying and I don't know when it will arrive.
If the order is canceled, can the refund be returned?
How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
One hour ago, it was confirmed that a rider was unwilling to wait any longer.
Don't scare people off the starting line when browsing books on Xinhua Net. Often, you can feel the explosive popularity of success-oriented books. Today's success-oriented books often tout "the best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve success.
Equal to saying, once you've gone beyond the "how-to" phase, which is actually the most fundamental and crucial part, these books all have a common characteristic - either you give it your all and do your best, or you don't do anything at all; either it's 100%, or it's 0; either you climb the Great Wall, or you stay put in the same place. This "best principle" is undeniably correct, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory encourages a path of "you have to suffer and make a 180-degree transformation," which is a fatal weakness for many people. For those who are rigidly adhering to the rules, sticking to the old ways, and resisting change, shouting "you need to transform" in their ears is likely to be self-deception and fooling others. Most people will feel intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to move forward, unable to make a decision; or they may make a rash decision in the moment and courageously take the first step, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for long.
The famous "From Tomorrow" joke by Mr. Ma Sanli, which perfectly embodies the "universal human nature", is the most hilarious way to express this "universal principle". The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making most people "gasp in amazement" when they see it. Perhaps "the second-best principle" is a path that can help more ordinary people achieve relative success.
The core of the "Second Principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "gathering small victories" - if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb the small sand hill in front of your door, because that's also stronger than staying in place. In summary, as long as you've done something, it's always stronger than not doing anything. Since the threshold has been lowered significantly, this has increased the possibility of ordinary people being able to persevere, and as long as you're persistent, your chances of success will also increase.
Only by following the "second-best principle" can one achieve success. The path to success may be longer, but it is achievable. In general, the "best principle" may appear to be the key to success for everyone, but in reality, it only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.
Now, do I need to re-place an order?
The phone keeps ringing without anyone answering, and it hasn't been delivered yet.
May I ask how long it will take to arrive? How can I contact you? How can I cancel the order?
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two meals, but there is an order that has been completed. I would like to ask how to contact the first rider who spoke to me earlier. There should be another rider who will send it.
According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on December 11, 2022, a reporter from the People's Government of Qinghai Province was informed that the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is an increase of 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002. Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Qinghai fish," is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 20th century and the 1970s, the large-scale killing and overpopulation of Qinghai Lake sturgeon, as well as the deteriorating water environment, led to a sharp decrease in the number of sturgeon in the lake. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake sturgeon was only 2592 tons. In 2004, the Qinghai Lake sturgeon was listed as an endangered species in the "Red Data Book of Chinese Species". Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake and prohibited any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for sturgeon in the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, as well as from selling sturgeon and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, as well as the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, scientifically designed "passageways for fish to pass" and other measures have been continuously strengthened to enhance the protection level. As a result, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's grass carp has increased year by year. Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department's deputy director, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 million grass carp have been artificially propagated and released for the restoration of Qinghai Lake's grass carp resources, with a contribution rate of over 23%. The Qinghai Three Rivers Source Region is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment and water-related wildlife in the Three Gorges region and the Qinghai Lake water body, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment has successively issued emergency bans on fishing in key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system for "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which needs to be filled up and the weather is cold.
Can you tell me if takeout is packed in a bag? We only see one bag, so we're wondering if it might have been accidentally left behind or if someone took it. Thanks.
It has been an hour and I still haven't sent it.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending the wrong order can make people disappointed. It's best to make reservations at other restaurants for the little friends to eat. The shops will be very busy during this holiday.
Is taking a bath in a bathtub with foam on your feet a sign of a leak? Choosing an appropriate bathtub can have good therapeutic effects on your feet, and today's Country Style editor will answer this question for you, hoping to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs have become more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are selling hot, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety risks. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet in it, he felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused the sensation, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they refunded the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the popular bathtub, such as whether it is suitable for what kind of people, what kind of materials are used, and whether it is safe at the highest setting. However, in general, bathtubs do not have electricity problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not be strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing a bathtub, it is recommended to choose a disassembled type.
Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards. At the same time, you can freely use the pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Eye-catching Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Hunan Daily Network December 10, 2022 (Full Media Reporter Zhang Shanwu, Hu Minmin, Correspondent Li Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Chahua Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry. The Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, He Suilie, and the Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Huanglong tea is in a new phase, and the rise of red tea injects new vitality into "Five-Colored Yangtze Tea". In recent years, the provincial committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan Yangtze tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three-Lake, Four-Water, Five-Color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main force, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving the increase in income for large tea farmers.
Fengshui turns, red tea gains strength. Tea experts in the province say that when green tea and black tea are harvested, tea farmers have income all year round. The output value of tea gardens continues to rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded the "Lake Red Tea" trademark to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use it, and New Hope held the "Source of Lake Red Tea".
In the New Tea Hall in Hangzhou, tea merchants from Fujian were impressed by a high-mountain tea named "Ice in Spring" and immediately placed an order. The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhen, expressed his happiness, saying that the epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea fair, the highlights are everywhere. The New Tea in Hangzhou is red, infused with the cultural essence of tea, and the popularity and trading are booming. The tea industry in the region is looking forward to a new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled? I don't want them, because I can't stop here, and he couldn't bring them.
#NUMBER# has been received, it is missing food.

With #PRS\_ORG# as evidence, I confirm that no one has taken it. #PRS\_ORG# wrongly accused me and I would like to reiterate that the delivery person has already completed the delivery. You did not send anyone to deliver the food, and then wrongly accused me of taking it.
I request you to immediately cancel, otherwise, I will report to the police.
The time-lapse photography is not yet available for store members to review the photo effects. Overall, it's not bad for taking two outfits. I particularly like the photo effects.
Service details: During the makeup process, I felt a bit uncomfortable due to pregnancy. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and allowed me to rest for a while. They also continuously provided me with hot water to drink. The price for this service is 1000 yuan. Thank you for your review, bunny. Originally, I was going to decline the ancient style, but the final result was simply too beautiful.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of energy and continue to move forward. We will continue to cheer you on! This photography studio is really amazing. I strongly recommend all my friends to come here. From reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to post-production, there is no compromise.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will carefully match makeup products to suit your style. The makeup products used are all from top brands. Even the photography is quite professional. The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two cute little kittens playing around.
We are working in Beijing, and many of the good photo studios in Beijing need to be booked half a year in advance. My colleagues who have been to Beijing have said that the final product is just so. We specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expressions and body language management are not very good, and we think this is a common problem for most people. The photographer, Brother Shine, will take pictures and record the natural and spontaneous moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, an excellent team. Our film and those around us have been praised to the sky. We have already recommended the team to our friends, and our friends who have seen the final product are also equally satisfied.
I hope this kind of studio won't be buried, and more people discover TA, and shoot their own style, rather than being formulaic. I am very grateful for the five-star reviews from Cai Xiong and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are a creative studio, and we will do our best with 120% effort to complete the task as long as the client likes us. It's sweet and heartwarming to meet assistants who are kind and friendly, and photographers who are lively and energetic. Every member of our team is super nice and the experience of shooting is unforgettable. The effect of the shooting is better than I imagined, and everyone has worked hard. Thank you all! 😘😘
Thank you for your review, getting to know you is also a coincidence. From Huhehaote to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is equivalent to several thousand kilometers of road. I am very happy to meet you, and I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao and play again next time.
I want to know how to give money. The delivery of the meal has already been sent.
There is no rider to receive the call from the restaurant staff right now.
A programming beginner who wants to share personal experiences. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, self-study is still a good choice. After all, the cost of training is very high, and you need to spend six months to learn. However, if you plan to get into this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are weak in self-study, training is even better.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it can be quite tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the faculty's strength. If the faculty's strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions have not yet built up their faculty strength.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is recommended to inquire about the institution and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can truly know the quality of the institution and whether the course explanations are good or not. Hello, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer your question as I don't have enough information about your personal situation. For example, your profession, age, desired language, and location can all affect your learning or career goals.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the learning cost is high and the investment in time is relatively large. Basically, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months. However, for the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can find training resources on B station. If you don't know where to find resources, you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive study.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time, I suggest that you go to training institutions to learn. This way, learning will not be too difficult, and the teachers' explanations are very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone to answer them. In addition, many training institutions now have employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and they will recommend you to companies after you finish your studies. This way, you can save a lot of trouble when looking for a job in the future. These are my some thoughts. Since I don't know your specific situation, I only gave a general introduction. If you have other questions or consultations, please feel free to contact me for communication and exchange.
I said 1 point before, I saw it on the App.
What do you call it when I haven't finished speaking, and you're doing something else?

The crystal lamp may be elegant, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will lose its luster and become dull without light. Only by cleaning it can it shine brightly. In the same way, in life, success can only be achieved by putting in effort and paying attention to details.

The current society and all industries are not good. But I always believe that as long as we are sincere, persistent, and hardworking, we will be better than others. At least we will be better than those who just sit and complain. One day's success depends on the morning. All the good things start from the morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything you wish for. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed, and having it made us happy; as we grew older, happiness became a goal we sought to achieve, and achieving it made us happy; but as we matured, we discovered that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it made us happy. Be true to yourself and act according to your heart, without regrets in life; walk your own path in life; the two treasures of life are a healthy body and a good mood, and living a beautiful life until old age! At every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges.
Often, what binds you is not your ability, but your active courage. If you can't avoid it, it's better to face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; if you face them bravely, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The biennial is co-organized by the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art Foundation and the UCCA Dune Art Museum in China. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries are participating in the exhibition. The artistic director of the exhibition is Zhang Ga, the director of the UCCA Dune Art Museum.
According to the introduction by the curatorial team, the theme of this year's double exhibition is "Touching the Stones to Cross the River", which represents the reform strategies taken during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of Saudi cultural development. This year's double exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Touching the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among the 27 Saudi artists' works, more than 40% are included, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among others; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly anticipated, some of whom use innovative ways to create art using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Mountain in the Creek" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
According to Bakkili, the chief executive officer of the Diraiye Foundation, he hopes that this year's biennial exhibition can establish an international dialogue and allow global audiences to understand the cultural and creative industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen exchanges and interactions. Tian Pengyu said: "The objective of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, enabling Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is reported that during the period of the opening of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Comprehensively standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net, Yunnan Province, December 12, 2022 (reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continuously do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Provincial Government recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, which will help promote the comprehensive development of rural areas. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs responsible person introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million rural public welfare positions, which are used to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken populations. These positions have played an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment growth, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Rural Revitalization Department, and the Ministry of Finance, and mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions, financial management, position development, and position management. In terms of position development, the new regulation is clear, and positions are set up in accordance with the principles of "as needed, positions established, dynamic management, and volume control," "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management." The recruitment process must follow the steps of advertisement, application, review, public announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and on-the-job training.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing rural public welfare positions, and stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position appointees. It was also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.

Although right-wing forces have had some periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight and break out into a sweat when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they show some signs of success, they are attacked and suppressed. However, when it comes to the facts, the right-wing forces have played an active role in promoting social progress. From ending the definition of truth during the Cultural Revolution to developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing forces should not be denied.
1. As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his views and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. Finally, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation. 2. To change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who try to profit politically from the situation are not rightists, but rather scoundrels.
Let's talk more about this. To be honest, the left is actually a group of discarded children of a generation and politics. If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost its value because it only wants what the Communist Party has discarded!
5. Recently, I've seen some friends getting angry at the rightists and debating with them, and they seem to be quite passionate about it. I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with the rightists or the leftists, it's all nonsense. Also, don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the rightists and leftists admit that we are right. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the enemy insults you with five cents, and when the left-wing insults you as a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct! Many people also had ideals when they were young, but after they grew up, they forgot about them, or pursued them, but ended up becoming obsessive. As their ideals gradually faded away, even the young dragon eventually turned into an evil dragon.
I generally think that "left and right" refers to constraint and freedom. China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic predisposition. The right-wing in China emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision and places more emphasis on fairness and safety. Nowadays, the overall society tends to place more emphasis on fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are in competition, and the left-wing is confirmed, and it is estimated to continue for many years to come.
Although you can't understand it, just give it a thumbs up and it's all settled. What else is there to say?
I don't want to wait until 19:06 to place an order. I've already waited for 2 hours. 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [strange search trends]. What is a normal search trend? I will randomly select three hot search terms: the Lunar New Year on February 2nd, the increase in the price of good friends, and the commodity price-raising incident. The search trend spreads and forms a wave, and then [the trend decreases exponentially] (smooth curve), eventually dissipating. If a secondary search trend occurs, a small wave will reappear.
They look exactly the same as the【Network Sentiment Evolution Model】displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal sentiment? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present【isolated peak】、【jagged】、【cliff】.
The following text is a description of three different types of events in Chinese social media:  【孤峰状】This refers to an event that quickly rises to the top of the hot search list due to public interest, such as a sudden increase in temperature.  【锯齿状】This refers to an event that periodically rises to the top of the hot search list, ensuring that the topic remains popular.  【断崖状】This refers to a collective withdrawal from the topic, indicating that the hot search has fulfilled its "function," and the topic has moved on to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave coincides with the trough of another event's heat wave, with time differences of only seconds, indicating that it is likely that the unified water army was given a new mission and launched a new offensive. The professionalization of black public opinion can be seen in the dozens of hot searches simultaneously appearing on the list, with some attracting attention, some responsible for knowledge dissemination, some creating strategic opportunities, some diverting attention, some influencing cognition, some
Propaganda is a science, discarding subjective factors such as stance and emotions, and only relying on objective data. Even black public relations will have no place to hide. Everyone who passes by will leave a trace, and we will excavate these traces together. Data source: Time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency on December 12, 2021, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant on December 10.
According to the introduction by Mao Weiguo, the Minister of Commerce, Karelis Jagtapier, a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, has been infected with the virus. Another infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius. The person tested positive for the virus on November 30. Both patients have been isolated and treated at the hospital, and their nucleic acid test results have turned negative. They have returned to their respective homes. Cyprus's Health Department announced on November 10 that the country has confirmed its first three cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.
The following text is a translation from Chinese to English:  These three people are students, and they returned to the country from abroad at the beginning of this month. They are all light cases and have not been hospitalized. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Argentine government is constantly increasing the level of epidemic prevention and control measures. From December 6th to January 10th next year, all passengers aged 12 or above who enter the country by air will need to pay for nucleic acid testing at the airport upon arrival.
The National Health Commission announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in China with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine. On the 9th, the Minister of Health in Malawi, Khumbize Chiponda, said that the country had discovered 3 cases of infection with the Omicron variant for the first time. The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found that these 3 cases were infected with the Omicron variant.

I don't think this will be helpful!
The text is already in English. It reads:  "Received. The order is frog-toothed, and the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#."
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff and explained.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
In the United States, 360 episodes of a TV show were shot in one location. The address is No. 156, South Ring Road, Happy Family Garden, 12th Floor. Initially, I learned about it through a friend because of trust, so I chose to go and take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
When you arrive at the store, a series of tricks begin. This is my first time visiting the store, and I only showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the actual site to measure the house, yet they were able to quote me that my 135 square meter house could be done for 700,000 RMB. I'm not sure what kind of materials they used, as I didn't pay much attention to their materials. Their second trick is that you can just come to the store and hand over the deposit (once you've paid the deposit, you can never get your money back unless you have enough experience and know how to deal with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. When I was caught up in the moment, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The quote they gave me had many problems: it did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom. These three items alone account for a significant portion of the basic renovation costs.
They charge higher fees for their services compared to other companies. I lost trust in this company after they didn't disclose everything upfront and made me sign a contract. When I tried to get my money back, they acted like a professional team with a dedicated group to handle the situation.
Regardless of how it is, it will be the customer's problem and they are completely irresponsible. They keep shifting the blame and there are many details that I don't want to go into, but in the end, it's all tears. In short, don't choose them because my friends who hired them for renovation also had poor quality, and they will calculate various expenses for you in the future. Scumbag, they are the original con artists in the decoration industry, and now they have changed their name to a big and beautiful one, as if they have closed down and reopened under a different name.
So don't choose such a shoddy renovation company. In the future, when choosing, please take a closer look and check these out. Renovation is not a small matter. If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibited from publishing various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant registration statement for the latest merchant information, such as address, phone number, business hours, and more. Visit the public channel for 360 integration of home decoration and design in Kunming.
This is so terrifying. If you don't cancel the order within 30 minutes, please do so!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, if you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I'll definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The chicken soup should be cooked, but what I received is raw meat, I can't eat it.
It has been 3 days without a response... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan! The most strange thing is that I have to pay shipping fees every time I use the same credit card now.
Would it be okay if I waive the deposit until you have finished your investigation, and then collect my monthly fee?
How can I contact the delivery staff?
It's already 3 o'clock, isn't it time for you to compensate me and knock on the door to send the package?
However, the rider was left at the door and the person still sent the wrong thing.
Your rider has already picked up your order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting for you at 19:25 and have received your order. However, they are still not willing to take you to buy the rest of your items. Should I order another delivery?
How are you going to deal with your rickshaw driver being gone and still have to wait?
I am going to send a complaint, and if you don't cancel it, I will report it to the police.
However, my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

If you need to add a discount code, that should be fine. Please don't need to resend it, I have already purchased it and don't want to waste it, thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and verbal abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks. In civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of behavior. If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized behavior.
From the beginning, when you started adding me on WeChat and sending friend requests with insulting posts, I took a non-responsive attitude. Then, you tried to publish so-called information about my hometown and father's name on social media, but I didn't respond. Later, you continued to harass me by tagging me multiple times a day and discussing insulting and humiliating remarks about me on WeChat and with your so-called friends, including topics such as my appearance, build, bedroom habits, and whether or not I should insert something. I... I've had enough.  Later, I received messages from more friends who had shared a photo of you with a sexual harassment component and insulting remarks on your WeChat account.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't keep quiet anymore. After the news of my report was posted, you didn't calm down at all, but became more and more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your identity, in our society, it is necessary to respect both genders.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of provocative, obscure, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me. You can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not your drawing or to publish any attacking statements. That's right, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need you to comment on them.
I don't even think there's a woman who would be willing to humiliate herself like this for the sake of fame. Friends asked me, is it okay? I said it's fine, but you won't believe it.
I think no woman would be able to endure such humiliation and still say she's okay. Whether in the workplace, society, politics, or business, only those who lack basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I cut off part of the comments and posted them for everyone to see. No one should be able to impersonate you, right? I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
Laugh out loud  会心一笑 (huì xīn yī xiào) is a Chinese phrase that means "laugh out loud." It is often used to describe a situation that is funny or amusing.
I have reported and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What's the use of a cow without meat? It's just chicken soup. You can't eat fresh meat.

On the twelfth day of the twelfth lunar month, I went to the "Hanshun" water purifier store. I saw the water purifier, and the store was having an activity with reasonable prices. It turns out that the house has 11 floors, from the second basement to the ninth floor. The first and second basements are parking areas, and parking is free during the day! The surrounding area is not bad, but there are few restaurants and hardware stores nearby, and the taste of the restaurant is average.
This elevator is also very slow, just like having a big illness, going down from floor 2 to floor 1, constantly going back and forth, and I've been pressing this floor for a long time. From the safety corridor, I went down to the first floor, which was also very slow, and directly went to a furniture store. The furniture store was closed, and I couldn't go out from the safety corridor! It turns out that even at home, there is still a need for improvement. There are many places that have not been developed. Address: No. 555, North 1 Road, High-speed Railway, Shayibake District. Transportation is convenient, and there is a large parking lot. Parking is free during the day.
Environment: The store is spacious, with 8-9 floors, selling everything from furniture for the home to various small items. Many well-known brands have set up shop in the store, including Momth, Oulai, Huadi, Laoban, Fengchengzhi, Hansheng, Yak, Youfeng, Silint, Fupingju, Wanjiale, Dazhi, Zhonglian, Meidi, Yadan... The number of brands is truly overwhelming, making it a great place to shop for products. If you're tired after browsing, you can sit on the comfortable sofa and take a break. Recently, I've been looking for a comfortable sofa to buy, and my friends told me that this store has a lot of sofas to choose from. I've looked at furniture and home decor from Jiajia and Meike, and they seem good too, but they're a bit more expensive, so I'm still undecided.

The Chongqing Yuzhong Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on December 10, following the opening of the Emei Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan's Leshan City on December 8. This is the second water-based green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation, after the Leshan Water-based Green Integrated Service Area. With this, the water-based green integrated service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The Ministry of Transport and the Yangtze River Waterway Management Bureau's deputy director, Qi Jianhua, introduced that provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have already established 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been well received by the majority of ship crews and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping. The establishment of water-based green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event in the construction of green Yangtze River shipping, and it has significantly improved the reception of ship pollutants and the service capacity of shipping. According to the introduction, water-based green comprehensive service areas are important facilities that provide comprehensive production and living services for ships and ship crews, and help ship crews solve their "urgent, anxious, and worried" problems.
This time, the two water service areas on the upstream of the Yangtze River have been successfully put into operation. They are integrated service areas that combine living services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the highlight. By realizing "one-stop berthing and multiple services" for ships in the port, it will make the work of ship crew members more efficient and their lives more convenient.
