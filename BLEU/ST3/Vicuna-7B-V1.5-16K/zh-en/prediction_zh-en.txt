觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。

ASSISTANT: A very meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides my driver's license! Let's popularize it: Emergency first aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures that are carried out before the ambulance arrives in the event of an emergency.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。这个时候便是需要急救的时候。如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！

ASSISTANT: It is well known that there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the event of an accident. In fact, this period of time is the most critical. At this time, it is the time when emergency aid is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then the window for saving my life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。“在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。

ASSISTANT: So how important is it for people around you to know first aid! When someone collapses near you, you can use your professional knowledge to perform CPR and save their life, rather than standing there helplessly and doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is truly terrifying. "In China, our official data shows that there are 3 million annual deaths due to accidents, and the most dangerous is sudden cardiac arrest."

ASSISTANT: If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, performing CPR on the person is useless. Only by performing artificial respiration and chest compressions can the person be saved. I have found that many people do not have the awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when an emergency arises, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill and let us be able to respond quickly in the event of an emergency.

The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the admission and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and the dual identity of vocational school students and trainee employees should be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For students who have not yet reached the age of 18 and are over 16 years old, the agreement must be signed by the student, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits for on-the-job training.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。

ASSISTANT: South African doctors: Omicron's spreading power is strong, but most cases are mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant. Although the spread of Omicron is faster, doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province report that the symptoms they are currently seeing in COVID-19 patients are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.

ASSISTANT: The organization's chief physician, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said, "They can control their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He added that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are more prone to contracting severe COVID-19 due to their underlying health conditions.

ASSISTANT: He said, compared to the previous wave of Delta COVID-19, in the treatment of new coronavirus patients, "they had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.

虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ”

ASSISTANT: Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks of time, the doctor's observation and early evidence have provided some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic. The average hospitalization time has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent cases of COVID-19, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of the disease in South Africa was 20%.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。

ASSISTANT: I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a similar-priced beginner's racket first. In fact, the price is often correlated with the level of friendliness, and if you can't tell the difference, then a high-priced racket will be more friendly than a low-priced one. This type of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial waste. Its strength is very low, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

ASSISTANT: The logic and hidden agenda behind it is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll sell you some cheap junk and you won't play anymore after two tries. This way, the cheap racket is good enough, and you won't feel sorry for yourself. When you can really tell the difference, it means you've improved, and when you come back to buy a good racket from me, I'll earn twice the money. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money and buy a second-hand racket from Prince or Donnay. These brands don't have a reputation, so good rackets are hard to sell at a higher price. A new racket for 500-600 yuan is good enough, and a second-hand one for 200 yuan is still enjoyable, isn't it?

江西３年内将培训万名乡村小学音体美教师-新华网新华社南昌５月２２日电（记者陈毓珊）记者近日从江西省教育厅获悉，为增强紧缺学科教师队伍保障能力，实现乡村义务教育均衡发展，自２０１６年起，江西省规划用３年时间为全省乡村（乡镇及以下）每所小学培训合格的音乐、美术、体育教师各１名，共计１万名。据了解，这次培训对象为江西全省乡村小学４５岁以下具有音乐、美术、体育学科知识基础或才能，能兼任音乐、美术、体育课程的其他学科教师。

ASSISTANT: According to a recent report from the Xinhua News Agency, the Jiangxi Province in China plans to train 10,000 rural elementary school music, art, and physical education teachers within the next three years to strengthen the teacher team and promote balanced development of rural compulsory education. Starting from 2016, the Jiangxi Province will allocate three years to train one music, art, and physical education teacher for each rural elementary school (village and below) in the province, with a total of 10,000 teachers to be trained. The training objectives are rural elementary school teachers aged 45 or below with music, art, and physical education knowledge or talents, who can also teach other subjects in addition to music, art, and physical education.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通过培训，使他们掌握音体美学科教学的基本知识和教学技能，更新教学思想和观念，掌握现代教学方法，提高学科教学能力、活动设计能力、校园文化能力及自我发展能力，建设一支一专多能的音体美教师队伍，缓解乡村音体美教师缺乏的问题。为确保培训质量和效果，江西还规划为全省１００个县（市、区）小学音乐、美术、体育各培训１名，共计３００名培训者，全面提升他们的教学示范引领能力、教研活动设计组织能力、施训能力、网络研修工作坊建设能力，起到教授、示范、指导、监督的作用。

ASSISTANT: Through training, they will acquire basic knowledge and teaching skills in the field of aesthetics, update their teaching concepts and ideas, master modern teaching methods, enhance their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of multi-skilled music and aesthetics teachers. This will help alleviate the problem of shortage of rural music and aesthetics teachers. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi has planned to train one music, art, and sports teacher from each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, with a total of 300 trainees. This will comprehensively enhance their teaching exemplary leadership ability, teaching research activity design ability, teaching ability, training ability, and ability to participate in online training workshops, and play the roles of teaching, exemplifying, guiding, and supervising.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。

ASSISTANT: In fact, paying attention to the clothing and accessories for thin girls is quite a lot. For fat girls, the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, just covering the fat part of the thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.

过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。

ASSISTANT: Wearing clothes that are too long can give the impression of being short and stout. If you wear clothes that are divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, it will give the impression that you have naturally grown taller. For example, using different colors for the top, skirt, and ankle-length socks can create a sense of length. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard outfits for pear-shaped women (the author has a deep understanding of this point), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body's fat. Elegant and refined black short dresses are the first choice for pear-shaped women.

穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。

ASSISTANT: Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look thinner. If you have fat legs, don't draw attention to them by wearing attention-grabbing socks and shoes. The more mainstream and toned down the color, the better.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make people feel fat. For slightly chubby girls, it is necessary to learn the rules of clothing coordination. Chubby girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the upper body should not be too short or stuffed in the skirt, which will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black ankle socks or mesh socks (with fine grids, please), choose a soft floral print skirt that covers well, and match a loose-fitting top with a ruffled collar, which can effectively cover the flaws of chubby girls.

当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔!

ASSISTANT: Of course, even thin girls wearing short skirts also require attention to detail. Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will enhance the effect of making you look taller. Short skirts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer combination!

ASSISTANT: If you are pear-shaped and have thin legs but a big belly, it is recommended to choose a beautifully designed short skirt. Not only can it conceal your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A letter-shaped skirt will look very slimming, which is more suitable for pear-shaped girls. When choosing an upper garment, choose something that is tight-fitting to create a layering effect, which will make you look even slimmer.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。

ASSISTANT: A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: The chairman of this organization, Wan Yuchong, said at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three schools has basically remained the same. Many studies have shown that these top schools discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process through "comprehensive consideration". Wan Yuchong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate compared to all other ethnic groups.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。

ASSISTANT: According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and request that the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions. They also hope that the schools that are being sued will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.

目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

ASSISTANT: Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously sued Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese American community, other groups such as the Indian American, Japanese American, Korean American, and Pakistani American education organizations have also participated in the lawsuit.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province, from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to buy the factory building. In December 2020, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member Lin and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring the money through a bank. Lin signed the "Factory Building Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the recipient of the deposit, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agreed to sign the factory building purchase and sale agreement within a week.

然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: However, after the two parties failed to reach a consensus on issues such as the scope of the factory and the payment method in the sales contract, the house purchase contract was delayed and could not be signed. Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin decided to refund the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After finally finding a house that he liked, paid the deposit, and was ready to pay the balance, he was just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller refused to sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。一审判决后，原告提起上诉。

ASSISTANT: Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court. The court after reviewing the case found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not required to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract and returning double the deposit. After the first-instance ruling, the plaintiff appealed.

ASSISTANT: 3200 newborn babies in Sabah do not have birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the special paper running out. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the special anti-forgery paper ran out in early October, it has not been able to issue birth certificates to newborn babies, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200. However, the department's director, KRU Amins, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the anti-forgery paper arrives next week.

ASSISTANT: At a news conference, he addressed the issue of a 10-month-long newspaper report on the problem of counterfeit paper production in Sabah.

ASSISTANT: He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used in Sabah is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRUAMINUS revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work. "The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to take stock, and the final printing will be done in Sabah immediately after.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。

ASSISTANT: The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control work in border cities. The notice requires that people who leave land border cities (excluding those with a border with Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test result, and after arriving in the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. The time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the border city range and announcing it in each province, autonomous region, and municipality, to March 15, 2022.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

ASSISTANT: In addition, it is noted that under certain conditions, cities at the border can study the establishment of a buffer zone for epidemic prevention and control within their jurisdiction. The National Health Commission's Office of Disease Prevention and Control has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent exchange between the two sides of the border. Implementing differentiated management policies based on the division of regions can turn the first line of defense from one to two lines, which may achieve the goal of reducing the risk of the epidemic spreading across the border and minimizing the social impact and cost of epidemic prevention and control.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。

ASSISTANT: Recently, there have been several domestic cluster-type epidemics in our country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemic areas through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as delayed and inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, poor implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formalism in regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of cold chain items at various nodes, inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies. The notice requires that efforts should be made from nine aspects, including improving the mechanism of border city epidemic control, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, etc., to fill in the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control work of border cities, and to do a good job of epidemic prevention and control work in a rigorous and scientifically accurate manner, to tighten the defense line against the import of epidemics.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: Notice emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the study and deployment of epidemic prevention and ensuring people's livelihood work, publish and publicize the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, regularly check and resolve hidden dangers in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices, and promptly respond to and proactively address prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notice, the border cities referred to include the counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the prefecture-level cities, autonomous regions, and municipalities where they are located, and the directly-administered municipalities. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on epidemic prevention needs and announced in a timely manner.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。

ASSISTANT: Don't scare people off the starting line when browsing books on Xinhua Net. Often, you can feel the explosive popularity of success-oriented books. Today's success-oriented books often tout "the best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。

ASSISTANT: Equal to saying, once you've gone beyond the "how-to" phase, which is actually the most fundamental and crucial part, these books all have a common characteristic - either you give it your all and do your best, or you don't do anything at all; either it's 100%, or it's 0; either you climb the Great Wall, or you stay put in the same place. This "best principle" is undeniably correct, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。

ASSISTANT: Because this theory encourages a path of "you have to suffer and make a 180-degree transformation," which is a fatal weakness for many people. For those who are rigidly adhering to the rules, sticking to the old ways, and resisting change, shouting "you need to transform" in their ears is likely to be self-deception and fooling others. Most people will feel intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to move forward, unable to make a decision; or they may make a rash decision in the moment and courageously take the first step, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for long.

马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。

ASSISTANT: The famous "From Tomorrow" joke by Mr. Ma Sanli, which perfectly embodies the "universal human nature", is the most hilarious way to express this "universal principle". The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making most people "gasp in amazement" when they see it. Perhaps "the second-best principle" is a path that can help more ordinary people achieve relative success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。

ASSISTANT: The core of the "Second Principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "gathering small victories" - if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb the small sand hill in front of your door, because that's also stronger than staying in place. In summary, as long as you've done something, it's always stronger than not doing anything. Since the threshold has been lowered significantly, this has increased the possibility of ordinary people being able to persevere, and as long as you're persistent, your chances of success will also increase.

只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: Only by following the "second-best principle" can one achieve success. The path to success may be longer, but it is achievable. In general, the "best principle" may appear to be the key to success for everyone, but in reality, it only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。

ASSISTANT: According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on December 11, 2022, a reporter from the People's Government of Qinghai Province was informed that the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is an increase of 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002. Qinghai Lake carp, also known as "Qinghai fish," is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: In the 20th century and the 1970s, the large-scale killing and overpopulation of Qinghai Lake sturgeon, as well as the deteriorating water environment, led to a sharp decrease in the number of sturgeon in the lake. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake sturgeon was only 2592 tons. In 2004, the Qinghai Lake sturgeon was listed as an endangered species in the "Red Data Book of Chinese Species". Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake and prohibited any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for sturgeon in the main rivers and tributaries of the lake, as well as from selling sturgeon and its products.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。

ASSISTANT: At the same time, through artificial propagation and release, as well as the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, scientifically designed "passageways for fish to pass" and other measures have been continuously strengthened to enhance the protection level. As a result, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's grass carp has increased year by year. Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department's deputy director, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 million grass carp have been artificially propagated and released for the restoration of Qinghai Lake's grass carp resources, with a contribution rate of over 23%. The Qinghai Three Rivers Source Region is an important ecological barrier and water source area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。

ASSISTANT: Is taking a bath in a bathtub with foam on your feet a sign of a leak? Choosing an appropriate bathtub can have good therapeutic effects on your feet, and today's Country Style editor will answer this question for you, hoping to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs have become more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。

ASSISTANT: On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are selling hot, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety risks. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet in it, he felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。

ASSISTANT: At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused the sensation, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they refunded the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。

ASSISTANT: Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the popular bathtub, such as whether it is suitable for what kind of people, what kind of materials are used, and whether it is safe at the highest setting. However, in general, bathtubs do not have electricity problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not be strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing a bathtub, it is recommended to choose a disassembled type.

中国工程院院士刘仲华教授在开幕式上隆重推介：湖红之源在新化，红茶崛起为“五彩湘茶”注入新动力。近年来，省委、省政府大力支持茶产业发展，推进千亿湘茶产业建设，形成“三湘四水五彩茶”的发展格局。省内茶界加大创新，绿茶、黑茶、红茶等主力茶类轮番发力，主产茶区推进茶旅融合，带动广大茶农增收。

ASSISTANT: Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Huanglong tea is in a new phase, and the rise of red tea injects new vitality into "Five-Colored Yangtze Tea". In recent years, the provincial committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan Yangtze tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three-Lake, Four-Water, Five-Color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main force, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving the increase in income for large tea farmers.

ASSISTANT: In the New Tea Hall in Hangzhou, tea merchants from Fujian were impressed by a high-mountain tea named "Ice in Spring" and immediately placed an order. The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Association, Wang Zhen, expressed his happiness, saying that the epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea fair, the highlights are everywhere. The New Tea in Hangzhou is red, infused with the cultural essence of tea, and the popularity and trading are booming. The tea industry in the region is looking forward to a new spring.

ASSISTANT: Thank you for your review, getting to know you is also a coincidence. From Huhehaote to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is equivalent to several thousand kilometers of road. I am very happy to meet you, and I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao and play again next time.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。

ASSISTANT: A programming beginner who wants to share personal experiences. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, self-study is still a good choice. After all, the cost of training is very high, and you need to spend six months to learn. However, if you plan to get into this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who are weak in self-study, training is even better.

要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

ASSISTANT: If you have strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it can be quite tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the faculty's strength. If the faculty's strength is not strong enough, the training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions have not yet built up their faculty strength.

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is recommended to inquire about the institution and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can truly know the quality of the institution and whether the course explanations are good or not. Hello, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer your question as I don't have enough information about your personal situation. For example, your profession, age, desired language, and location can all affect your learning or career goals.

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

ASSISTANT: If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the learning cost is high and the investment in time is relatively large. Basically, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months. However, for the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can find training resources on B station. If you don't know where to find resources, you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive study.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time, I suggest that you go to training institutions to learn. This way, learning will not be too difficult, and the teachers' explanations are very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone to answer them. In addition, many training institutions now have employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and they will recommend you to companies after you finish your studies. This way, you can save a lot of trouble when looking for a job in the future. These are my some thoughts. Since I don't know your specific situation, I only gave a general introduction. If you have other questions or consultations, please feel free to contact me for communication and exchange.

中沙策展人携手举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展-新华网新华社利雅得12月12日电（记者王海洲 胡冠）沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展 — — 迪里耶当代艺术双年展，于11日在位于沙特首都利雅得西北部的迪里耶JAX艺术区正式向公众开放，共有来自沙特、中国等地的64位艺术家参展。本次双年展由沙特迪里耶双年展基金会和中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心联合策划，中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心馆长田霏宇担任艺术总监。

ASSISTANT: The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art, was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The biennial is co-organized by the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art Foundation and the UCCA Dune Art Museum in China. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries are participating in the exhibition. The artistic director of the exhibition is Zhang Ga, the director of the UCCA Dune Art Museum.

据策展团队介绍，本次双年展的主题为“摸着石头过河 ” ， 隐喻社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当下境遇。本次双年展占地近12000平方米，展厅横跨六个相互连接的建筑，以六个单元呈现 ： 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 。其中，27位沙特艺术家的作品数量占本次展品总量的四成以上，囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品同样备受关注，有的艺术家以新颖的方式使用回收材料进行创作，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图 》 （ 2014）中，用废弃物重构了一幅经典山水画。

ASSISTANT: According to the introduction by the curatorial team, the theme of this year's double exhibition is "Touching the Stones to Cross the River", which represents the reform strategies taken during the period of social economic transformation and also reflects the current situation of Saudi cultural development. This year's double exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings presenting six units: "Touching the Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among the 27 Saudi artists' works, more than 40% are included, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among others; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly anticipated, some of whom use innovative ways to create art using recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Mountain in the Creek" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.

迪里耶双年展基金会首席执行官巴克利表示，希望本届双年展能够建立国际对话，让全球观众有机会了解沙特蓬勃发展的文化产业和创意社区，加强互动往来。田霏宇说 ： “ 双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特观众融入当代艺术世界 。 ”据了解，在双年展开幕周期间还将举办系列讲座，艺术家、策展人和创意行业的意见领袖将就跨文化交流、当代艺术发展等主题展开讨论。

ASSISTANT: According to Bakkili, the chief executive officer of the Diraiye Foundation, he hopes that this year's biennial exhibition can establish an international dialogue and allow global audiences to understand the cultural and creative industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen exchanges and interactions. Tian Pengyu said: "The objective of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, enabling Saudi contemporary art to participate in global dialogue and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is reported that during the period of the opening of the biennial exhibition, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Comprehensively standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net, Yunnan Province, December 12, 2022 (reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continuously do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Provincial Government recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, which will help promote the comprehensive development of rural areas. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs responsible person introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million rural public welfare positions, which are used to provide employment for rural difficult groups such as poverty-stricken populations. These positions have played an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment growth, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

ASSISTANT: This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, the Rural Revitalization Department, and the Ministry of Finance, and mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions, financial management, position development, and position management. In terms of position development, the new regulation is clear, and positions are set up in accordance with the principles of "as needed, positions established, dynamic management, and volume control," "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one position, voluntary disclosure, and unified management." The recruitment process must follow the steps of advertisement, application, review, public announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and on-the-job training.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the new regulations also clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing rural public welfare positions, and stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position appointees. It was also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

ASSISTANT: Although right-wing forces have had some periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight and break out into a sweat when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they show some signs of success, they are attacked and suppressed. However, when it comes to the facts, the right-wing forces have played an active role in promoting social progress. From ending the definition of truth during the Cultural Revolution to developing the economy, improving technology, promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing forces should not be denied.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: 1. As for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his views and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, harm people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. Finally, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation.
2. To change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who try to profit politically from the situation are not rightists, but rather scoundrels.

ASSISTANT: Let's talk more about this. To be honest, the left is actually a group of discarded children of a generation and politics. If the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost its value because it only wants what the Communist Party has discarded!

五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

ASSISTANT: 5. Recently, I've seen some friends getting angry at the rightists and debating with them, and they seem to be quite passionate about it. I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with the rightists or the leftists, it's all nonsense. Also, don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the rightists and leftists admit that we are right. Why bother?

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the enemy insults you with five cents, and when the left-wing insults you as a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct! Many people also had ideals when they were young, but after they grew up, they forgot about them, or pursued them, but ended up becoming obsessive. As their ideals gradually faded away, even the young dragon eventually turned into an evil dragon.

左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: I generally think that "left and right" refers to constraint and freedom. China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic predisposition. The right-wing in China emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision and places more emphasis on fairness and safety. Nowadays, the overall society tends to place more emphasis on fairness. At the same time, China and the United States are in competition, and the left-wing is confirmed, and it is estimated to continue for many years to come.

大美360集成家装地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼一开始是朋友介绍的因为信任，所以选择来看一下起初我的预算是7万做个基本装修。

ASSISTANT: In the United States, 360 episodes of a TV show were shot in one location. The address is No. 156, South Ring Road, Happy Family Garden, 12th Floor. Initially, I learned about it through a friend because of trust, so I chose to go and take a look. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for a basic renovation.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: When you arrive at the store, a series of tricks begin. This is my first time visiting the store, and I only showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the actual site to measure the house, yet they were able to quote me that my 135 square meter house could be done for 700,000 RMB. I'm not sure what kind of materials they used, as I didn't pay much attention to their materials. Their second trick is that you can just come to the store and hand over the deposit (once you've paid the deposit, you can never get your money back unless you have enough experience and know how to deal with them).
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. When I was caught up in the moment, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan. The quote they gave me had many problems: it did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom. These three items alone account for a significant portion of the basic renovation costs.

除去这些他们的服务点费收的也比其他家公司的高。我对这个公司失去了信任，一开始什么都没有讲清楚就让我签合同。当我去找他们退钱的时候他们表现出很有经验的样子，有专门的小团队来对付你。

When I tried to get my money back, they acted like a professional team with a dedicated group to handle the situation.

无论如何都会一口咬死是客户的问题他们全然无责。各种推卸责任，还有很多细节，不想一一说了都是泪，总之不要选择他们，因为我朋友找他们装修的房子也是质量不好，后期给你算各种费用。坑爹，他们就是原来骗人的龙头装饰，现在改成大美，好像又倒闭了又改成其他的。

ASSISTANT: Regardless of how it is, it will be the customer's problem and they are completely irresponsible. They keep shifting the blame and there are many details that I don't want to go into, but in the end, it's all tears. In short, don't choose them because my friends who hired them for renovation also had poor quality, and they will calculate various expenses for you in the future.

The establishment of water-based green comprehensive service areas is another milestone event in the construction of green Yangtze River shipping, and it has significantly improved the reception of ship pollutants and the service capacity of shipping.
