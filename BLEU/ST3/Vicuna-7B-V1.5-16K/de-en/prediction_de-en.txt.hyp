The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's value... I am #PRS\_ORG# major customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I only need a number or instruction on how to package the item so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I have ordered the #PRS\_ORG# for a few days ago... for 249€. Today it costs 179€. To be honest, I find that very annoying.
Must I cancel the order and reorder for a better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally think that it's not appropriate to expect children to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I also think it's good for older siblings to help out with caring for the younger ones to some extent. Maybe take a quick look, maybe lend a hand, maybe bring them a drink, etc.
So learn responsibility, help at home, and be involved. As long as they can still take care of themselves, I see no problem. If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it's okay for him, that's fine too.
You can best measure whether it fits for your children. It is not the case that he should wind K2 and accompany them for hours while falling asleep. It is probably legally questionable.
Perhaps the statement of the psychologist also applies here. If something were to actually happen, such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you are willing to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book! I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but I can't seem to remember the title. Maybe someone here knows... The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going to his raptors' enclosure. The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, finds out that the therapist he goes to, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety, is also involved. The commissioner has a niece who also has a fear of fire and ends up at this therapist's clinic.
There is an increase in suicides and there is a new protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of a suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet. Ultimately, it is revealed that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients are ultimately forced to confront their fears to the extreme. (a woman jumps out of a window, another intentionally drives herself to death)
This is referred to as "the fight" in the book. At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that involves fire. That is the rough plot, and I am pretty sure that the book was written by a French author/authoress.
If this story is familiar to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh well, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available. I have to contact my husband, but that could take a while.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter unter dem Daumennagel Kind, 4 years old, has wood splinters under the thumb nail (outside). Have tried to remove them with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp. Did not work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left. Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can thus be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0. LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" loudspeaker with a sound capsule construction kit.
As all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder. He masters the data format DCC just as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are just as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thank you RailComPlus®, decoders automatically register at an appropriate digital central station. It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, compatible central stations can read CV values on the main line. For central stations that can only program CVs up to 255, there are helper registers.
Motorola users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx-compatible central stations. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® brake tracks just as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system. It is also possible to brake with DCC brake stones or with direct current.
In addition, he also uses a Selectrix® braking diode. An ABC pendulum train automation enables automatic pendulating between two stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on analogue DC and AC railways.
After my coupon, which was not delivered due to a complaint that did not reach me, is no longer eligible for extension, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place a new order elsewhere where customer friendliness is higher and I don't have to type in my fingers for nothing to achieve nothing! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson will accelerate the vaccination rollout In response to the new Omikron cases, politics and science in the UK are working to accelerate the vaccination rollout. Therefore, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Eve.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to accelerate the rollout of COVID-19 booster vaccinations amid rapidly rising Omikron numbers. Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination. The previous target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the constituent countries of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing an emergency situation due to the Omikron variant, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccine protection, said Johnson. The good news is that the vaccine level can be increased with a third dose.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson. On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, which brought the total to 3137. Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent out a job application. Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email.
I will reply to the email. Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on where they have a cultural background, it can be either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email. Could someone please help me? I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it. 4 of them are going. Only the one I bought today is not working.
Apparently, the cushion had a hidden defect at the time of sale. How could such a cushion defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First, on the #PRS\_ORG#, it is attempted. However, this has been failing for about 14 days now.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# but wanted to buy 8. However, there were none left. Now they are available again, and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in detail here. I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons. A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims cannot help themselves or we think we cannot help them. Of course, I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are things in my profession that move me less than when I can't do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in a private conversation with the perpetrator, far beyond sight and hearing range, I can't help everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, even when it's very close to tears, everyone deserves to live without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to endure violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't. It will never be easier. Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so unbelievably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What use is the series to "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing design: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix. Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, was left. Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomach." However, this anger did not subside after the game, but rather intensified due to the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone was disappointing, it was the way the team performed that was even more disappointing.
Substitute a statistic for the entire dilemma: The triple quote amounted to just 13 percent, 4 goals (all from young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any more questions? John Patrick's answer was: "We weren't concentrated enough after our victory at Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained." Specifically, moving the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently to his counterpart: "What a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people." However, there were only 750 spectators allowed at the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made up for it.
Not only because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led his team. "The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim. While in Patrick's team, the key performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points after being behind 39:59. Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points. Fortunately, there was not much time for bickering.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM), the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, followed by a game in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have informed ourselves legally and have therefore sent them again.
We originally registered ourselves about half a year ago.
Just as peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59. He can charm his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good morning, dear luck" - as long as he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. However, that won't happen. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "due to official instructions" to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Other planned performances during the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (<http://www.palast-orchester.de>). From January, the artists will then make up for the already postponed concerts from 2020 due to the pandemic. Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and happily since his youth.
In Berlin did he study operatic singing, in 1986 he founded together with fellow students the Palast Orchester. Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chanson in the style of the Comedian Harmonists, receiving numerous awards.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream. Always elegantly dressed, his blonde hair strictly combed back and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer to be overlooked from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good morning, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance? It could be used to complement the existing furniture and we could check if it matches in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only shuffle the cover sheet but not flip the pages.
Federal Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing The new Federal Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin. "With expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain payable in the coming years. A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is actually the best protection against monopolization. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission, as how to deal with the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on landlord increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent cap. I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not calm down, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I noticed a few days later that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process. Unfortunately, the product is no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will come again? #PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
"Gutschein sounds great! Then I'll solve it independently in the new order. Thank you for the quick clarification!"
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut myself on my finger. That is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky. A devastating storm system has drawn numerous tornadoes across the USA. Alone in Kentucky, there could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone. On the night of Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the United States and possibly up to a hundred fatalities. The storms leave a trail of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had passed through, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - all gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible. He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official numbers are increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out. That is very unfortunate. Is it still produced?
Is she completely out of stock? Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when will you let me know? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, I can only order the cover now and have it shipped to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return request and wanted to inquire if it had arrived or was being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans. While the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, Austrian companies have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated. This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls, modeled after the German approach, is intended to increase willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations.
He has switched companies, but that doesn't make his situation any better than yours. Just wait and drink tea.
It's been a year. He obviously didn't stick to his old job and looked for something else. That's fine too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, that's okay. He didn't like his job either. There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation please. That would be legally relevant. I will take a screenshot.

Help at first own campaign Boron to greetings! I am currently leading a group of 4 friends through the adventure Over the Griffin's Pass and I want to guide my heroes seamlessly into a player-written campaign.
We are playing DSA 5. The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been devised, and now I am in the process of writing the starting adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes have to transport a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further development of the story will take place there. A group of goblins will ambush the hero a few miles from the village and lure them into a trap. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever the players prefer.
Strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers armed.  The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a narrow path and flank left and right with three each armed with bows. The two with spears block the wagon. If the battle comes and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village headman, a half-elf. Of course, the cart is gone. 2. If an unavoidable defeat is imminent, this half-elf will intervene with two of his servants and help the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great. How do you apply Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the Encounter too much of an entry into the adventure?
The group Goblins will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
I have taken the lamp apart again. And again, I have put it back together. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back. Can you please let me know when the return labels will be available so that I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#?

We didn't do anything with the chair. Suddenly, there was a rip there. I was just sitting on it.
Here is the translation:  "Here was the lower part, i.e. the part with the damaged storage. Will everything be collected again or only the storage part?"
I am bored with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased so much that I need to vent a bit with this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning put the schedule far behind schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision (!) if necessary. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it's still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race to the end.
Nonetheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule misunderstanding among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag in F1. Although this situation had already occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were relevant radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was a possibility for Verstappen. I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules if they comment on the F1 on a pay-TV channel. It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules. Both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, Roos' artificial commenting style doesn't appeal to me, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. However, I genuinely find Heiko Water from RTL better. There are constant nonsensical things that both come across as unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latest commentator is causing a lot of commotion in the comments, which seems not to take him seriously. Not least, advertising takes over on Sky, while in the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear the German commentary without commentary after the race on F1TV. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Although these two channels show less advertising than Sky, and as free TV channels, I must say that Glock and Baumgartner deserve praise for their work. However, this does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sports F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit the F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, excluding advertising. So, the fantastic F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and hasn't been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and nothing has happened. The First Lady told me that it would be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check her email and send it, but she never did.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 2019. One of them has already shown a defect (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair). I need support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen. It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air lift. This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can see the services in comparison. If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire facilities with them.
If you have a large aquarium, it is recommended to use pumps with 2 or more outlets so that multiple air stones can be connected. The MK-series has 1, 2, or 4 outlets, depending on the model, but turbo pumps are also suitable for setting an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function, such as a treasure chest, shell or similar.
The MK-series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise. The installation is very easy. The blower pump is connected via an air hose 4/6 mm to a throttle valve or the like... and it's ready to go.
The blower impeller should be, or higher than the water level, and mounted externally. If the blower impeller is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed between them. Cut the air hose and place the valve between them.
This would prevent it from happening if the water flowed backwards in the pool, as the water would not flow out of the pool through the pump... If the blower pump is installed outdoors, it should also be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Even though we state the processing time as 3 days on eBay, packages are packed daily and picked up daily as well. Everything is running smoothly, it's going very quickly. We just want to take a precautionary measure so that no one gets upset just because something took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in logistics...naturally here Corona doesn't hold. Please don't judge immediately, just because the delivery is delayed, that lies exclusively with the parcel services. People naturally complain about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also regionally very different. Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Is it also possible to order the legs in a lighter color?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV moderator into space The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV moderator and four other passengers have embarked on a short trip to space. They were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, on Saturday.
The start and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas. Jeff Bezos personally welcomed the newly-certified astronauts back to Earth after their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers stepped out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were in transit for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space travel engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each passenger paid for their ticket. Laura Shepard Churchley reminded after the short flight of the mission of her father. He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
She was just simply flown along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic. He would like to return to space immediately, said the host.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height. The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated. The capsule that was detached from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, briefly experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Aerospace Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: on the first flight in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman. On the second flight in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous worldwide with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was on board, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of primarily pursuing the business of space tourism without significant scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without consideration for the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in a color or cycle through its entire color palette. When a color change is requested, the light stone maintains a light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp ensures year-round outdoor use.
In a snowy environment, its light even shines particularly well - only to be expected with a shorter light duration, as the days become shorter. Please pay attention in the winter to ensure that no snow interferes with the solar module's function. The "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the AA (gängig) format that can be easily replaced if needed.
You can purchase an appropriate replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the usage duration of your device.

Perfect, that's in agreement :) Do I need anything else to address? You only need the tracking number at my email?
Someone who works or studies in biochemistry I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting, and in the laboratory it doesn't bother me either (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course). Of course, I have also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely study until the doctorate and become a researcher.
Currently, I am experiencing doubts, particularly concerning career prospects. On the one hand (Studycheck etc), one hears constantly great career prospects and the profession being highly sought after, on the other hand, one hears constantly about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would be really interested in:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your work/salary? 3. What have you studied/what kind of education have you received?
Would you do it all again? Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering abandoning my studies in 2022 and becoming a computer specialist instead.
If you have any experiences, please share them as well :)
Extra stress during vacation and holiday weekends. This topic came up last week with me. But now I have to use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore, now a post is needed. Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas, is there a lot of stress in our operation. It seems that there is also a lot of stress on weekends and holidays.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt". Most people and businesses take a bridge day on Friday, which is semi-officially recognized. Therefore, last week there was a long 4-day weekend.
What about last week? Everywhere stress. Endless emails that had to be dealt with before starting the weekend. Orders here, orders there, everything *absolutely* had to be taken care of before the long weekend.
If... yes, because "next week then" sounds so much after so much time and that shouldn't be? Or because people want to take everything seriously in a shortened week as much as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also extremely angry. What's the point of this self-imprisonment due to holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent and self-sufficient. My question is simply: Are we like this only because we are Swiss? Is this our reformed-evangelical way of doing things?
Or do you know that in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet. "The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one simply drives to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
She would agree to the party by baking and frying with her son. "I love that," said Catterfeld. But before the sensible days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, I have to get going now."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moult and feather regrowth. NECTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg. NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird husbandry is solely due to nutritional errors. Since feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein nutrition of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage. For a functioning metabolism, the daily ration must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein and/or vitamin and mineral supply. The unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced in the composition of NEKTON-Bio. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
NECTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or through the feed.
Thank you, I found it but it still doesn't work unfortunately.
"a die F-Teile sind es, ich habe ein Bett von euch erhalten. Allerdings gab es Probleme mit einem Teil."
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet. What do we do now? I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are faulty. The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder. Therefore, I receive new ones.
When will they be sent out? No, no flat ones. These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones in terms of shape, they were only too narrow.
But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose. With me, they are not flat.
Could I get this forwarded? Hello #NAME#, could you please explain the problem to me again?
House fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people were lightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria. In addition, a estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has been caused, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire seems to have spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, and the police did not assume intentional arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But then it comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo Uğur Şahin, the CEO of Biontech, published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021. Uğur Şahin had not previously expressed his vaccination status publicly.
The entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination. The illness of a friend has motivated him to do so, according to Şahin. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
In social media, there were false informations that I allegedly was not vaccinated. Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn". "For a few months, my friends have been pressuring me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because communication should not revolve around him. But a phone call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family have not been vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask for the reasons. "The most common reason seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts alone, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences. An interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated.
"I am currently not legally allowed to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time. There is prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases probably also no heating. A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours. On Friday evening, at 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communities, the lights went out. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency generators had been in operation until the widespread disturbance could be fully resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered support in schools by providing care places and calling for neighborly help. The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and thanked the helpers for their efforts.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions. We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring effort, said the head of the department of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will take some days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily put some cables back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to company statements. Power is flowing again. The fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to statements from Westnetz.
Here extensive cleaning and repair work is required. At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again available.
Since Saturday 6:00 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 9:30 pm. Since 11:15 pm, the last affected residents have also had power.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies have been in use. Authorities had called for neighborhood aid after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It's important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially older or lonely people, and inform their local fire stations if help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, according to government statements, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not care for themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It concerns the daily agenda #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you are also having a nice day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the underframe on the tabletop. It's a custom #NAME#. There are 3 versions of it.
We wanted to get table tops with a diameter of #NUMBER#, but we ended up with a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# came, but I cannot nest it and thus shorten it. Can you help me further? Otherwise, I would have to send it back as it is not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback.
That is really simpler! Then let's do it! Please send me the return shipping label via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat. However, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG# before the purchase.
Should I do it now?
I find such a small font almost insulting. We are not satisfied with that.
Nordic combination: Riiber wins The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää. The duo had to give up again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping.
Translation:  Return of the order number #NUMBER# When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Both of us have updated it and are using version 4.5... it's possible that they may have heard of the problem before.
Directly with my #PRS\_ORG#, I bought a book, it seems to be on it. When I try to open it, the message comes up, "ups! This document cannot be opened."
The date is possibly faulty. They report it to the customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can you help me further?
"Chat connection is gone and now? I have to work in between!"
In order for the paint to be applied evenly and cleanly, you should clean the parts with soap and water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water, and let them dry. Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes. You can do this on the later non-visible inside of the parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the piece should be drawn evenly with the brush, stroke by stroke. The slight overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistic-looking areas. A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors. The dark ones may otherwise appear later. Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Previously, unsightly metal streaks could occur when they mixed with normal colors. Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before applying the decals/stickers. The models achieve an authentic appearance through the decals/stickers.
From insignias on aircraft to ship names, from trim strips and license plates on automobiles: Decals give the model the final polish. Place the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible. An aircraft cockpit can be cleaned or more easily adhered to before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as a knife, tweezers, and toothpick, is the time, patience, and a steady hand when applying decals. Cut each required decal individually and arrange them properly. Decals are also called water transfer decals because you moisten their backside with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you just stick the picture a little bit from the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened). While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Note: Always check first if the picture is sitting correctly before you completely peel it from the paper, so it doesn't stick, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only briefly open a book when I am looking for something else, then I no longer want to read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the page where I left off. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Can I get this through email? Also for all 3 packages? Since the lamp came in 3 separate packages at my place.
Ok, despite many thanks! Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned. Can I have the problem resolved easily?
Insurance coverage for fertility treatment at PKV / What is a "insurance case"? Hello everyone, we have been dealing with fertility treatment for a while now, but when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly becomes an issue.
According to the plan: We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance at the PKV and received the approval for up to 3 attempts. The attempts were not in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) limited.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was counted towards the PKV. A few months later, we tried to have a second child and went through 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but these were not yet counted towards the PKV. We applied again for the costs to be covered by the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After some further attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, logically the most expensive ones should be replaced with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to replace 3 attempts. The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise are lost. The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB (General Terms and Conditions), "The insurance event begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the treatment need no longer exists." Here are the questions for the experts in the round:  * Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (we are entitled to 5 attempts)?
If the private health insurance (PKV) had pointed out in the contract that a birth would result in the abandonment of further attempts, * is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? Infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
Okay. We won't be ordering from them anymore. If they add up the transactions from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they must have lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass it on to their manager. That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first. I can't really do anything about it since the commode is completely destroyed when it arrived at my place. Please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote.
It is clear and distinct that the repayment was initiated and I have not yet received a repayment per #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account, which we will no longer do.
No, the defect only occurred after several months. A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they cannot sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to provide a different type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products promoted with additional hooks that we cannot find? Can you help us?
Theme of the week: The best low-budget films  What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits. According to Wikipedia, the following applies:  Please note that the translation may not be 100% accurate due to the complexity of the original text and the limitations of machine translation.
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. In the net, one can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it? And what don't you like about it, perhaps?
As a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. The delivery time has been extended again, is this now reliable?
Many thanks With friendly greetings There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll try again soon because it just doesn't work here. Hello
"Partial victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime, but the costs are high and there are significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP). This state of suspension - Belarus is not entirely small, but the EU feels like a winner - probably goes on for a while longer. The handling of people at the border is not in harmony with the European Convention on Human Rights, judged Bossong.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole is not committed to countering this, it is at the expense of basic rights. This development also weakens the cohesion within the Union.
She seems to be unable to prevail when a member state insists on doing things its own way, as is currently the case with Poland, which even prevents Frontex, the EU border protection agency, from accessing the border. In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong points out: a consensus on asylum policy will be harder to reach, as the slogan "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at crossing the border.
According to statements by Poland's border guard, migrants have attempted again to enter Polish territory through Belarus. 55 migrants were arrested overnight on Sunday and taken back to the border, a spokesperson for the authorities said on Sunday. Polish border guards were reportedly attacked with stones by the migrants while trying to stop them.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. On Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants managed to overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan had crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months, or had attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU. Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections according to press reports.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country. EU commissioners also traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure. The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, according to Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures. Minsk must also consider internal political costs. The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly passes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale in which Max Verstappen won. According to Mercedes, Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race. Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection.
The silver arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest is based on a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, where he allegedly made an illegal overtaking maneuver. A second appeal was filed against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed correctly. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in a Mercedes on the last lap and was on his way to his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase in which the Dutch driver had overtaken the cars in front of him.
I am checking it. I will speak with the bank and thank them again for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag. As the park announces, members and permanent cardholders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages. The roller coasters were lit up with red and white stripes on this day. Foxy, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
Already since the early 1990s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. The first SC Freiburg Fantag at the Europa-Park has again shown how well the partnership fits. Fans can be seen having fun on the roller coaster, confirming this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything. That's like when an AfD supporter says they have nothing against foreigners. You'll give them an inch, they'll take a mile.
But Kollegah is constantly reproducing some kind of anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it be. Yes, then you are just as little taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the basic principles of evolution is simply lost. Of course, there may be a God who created everything. But once you become a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense.
And thus, you are a science hater and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the microscope should be brought as close to the eye as possible. The specifically plan-achromatic and achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the microscope in a practically distortion- and color-error-free manner up to the edge of the field of view. Often, microscope lenses are marked with magnification values.
However, these specifications only apply to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the intended use conditions. In order to use your loupe optimally, we ask you to pay attention to the notes in the table "Technical Data" (see instruction manual in the packaging). Light reflections occur on the surface of all optical device lenses, including at the impact points.
By using an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When used in accordance with optimal usage conditions - with the loupe tight against the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. Additional information can be found in the accompanying usage guide (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers. He has already experienced many curious situations during the Christmas tree sale. Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants around 200 of them. The 56-year-old has experienced many strange situations. This makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit amusing, he says.
And what about the gift certificate? Otherwise, as a customer, I'm gone? At least I received a defective delivery and now I've paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both have their name as a result.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "turner," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLAN/Magic  We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks now. Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, with a few exceptions, flawlessly received and transmitted 50 Mbit. The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also come. However, at the other DLan module, which sends WiFi, not the full 500 Mbit comes anymore, but the further I move away from the module with a power strip (which is placed 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less comes in (so use a power strip that is placed 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor (~45 Mbit) than before. I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than DLan, but here too there were similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line using fiber optics? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely inconvenient to lay LAN cables throughout the house.
I am on the verge of despair, which is why I created an extra account here. Therefore, I would be overjoyed by a response.
When it's time to switch bank accounts, who would have thought that first there would be calm at the savings accounts, but one is disappointed. While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with various tricks to their customers, the negative interest rates continue to decrease.
The German Bank, for example, was previously considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now, it has halved the limit and even quadrupled it for savings accounts. Initially, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate subsidiary Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings account customers.
However, these lower thresholds now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request. Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the limit at ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB has lowered the free thresholds in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks have now a free threshold of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros, but there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which have been granted legal rights by the first instance court in Berlin.
Now, in banks, it is being discussed whether institutes should possibly create reserves - in case the upper instances declare the negative interest rates in principle as unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.
The table plate for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood. However, her life resembles a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year. For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
At least, Aniston, allow yourself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag). That your hearts still fly equally to the female and male fans is actually a miracle. Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the great love.
And the baby wish from the list was crossed out. Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. That hurt her.
The people who asked have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. Let's hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it. After a driving error and a slight brush with the band, Raikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo not even halfway through the race at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the top class of motorsports.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 with Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from the pole, and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 achievements is the goal of the bobsled pilot. "I have calculated it, I would have to drive nine and a half victories per season, then I could achieve it until Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he defended against Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by reducing his lead by 0.5 seconds, going from rank three to one. Then he made a slight adjustment to his material setting and emerged with a larger lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday. With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We went for a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd consecutive win. The Berchtesgaden driver Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, came in second this time in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race and ended up in eighth place. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would also do it," said Lochner. Nolte wins at home - Jamanka on the podium  Translation:  Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in fourth place in the first race and ended up in eighth place.

Laura Nolte scored her third season win in the two-man bob on her home track. After only reaching fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory with her pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday. Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thüringen finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
Besides qualifying for the Olympics, she achieved her first podium finish this winter. Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished with Leonie Fiebig in third place. For me, it was really cool to achieve my first podium in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama is joining me.
I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential, but the start times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it." Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not entirely flawless rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I could buy it now! What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay for it, which is why I finally asked about it. Due to Corona, I had other problems last year and never had the time for it. And now it was said to have expired, which really annoyed me.
Look at the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I want to return it and then order it again because it's currently on sale.
Therefore, the shipping will only start on March 16th? There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Yesterday, it was taken away by your colleague. Why is that a problem today? I also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered one.
But we still want the shelf module, even a new undamaged one, and not the entire order canceled.
Only today, only this week, only until XY... Hello beautiful girls and women, I have something I just want to write and maybe it will resonate with one or more of you...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student, and dog mom - to be honest, my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, but he is basically my child. My best friend (since 6J together) is sick, has a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because my hand is in a bandage due to a burn). He is also cold and we see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) due to my needs for affection and love. My dog child just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is relaxing in his cozy blanket after I was there with the warm lamp and stroking him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month. Now there is also housework that falls on us, which we naturally divide up. But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is currently well-established, I am almost well-treated and I am on the right track. Not well, but I am on the right track and almost symptom-free. My university is demanding a lot of me right now (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left. So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then it goes on again?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the vacation. Only until the weekend.
Only until... And so it goes on forever. I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental points of reference, otherwise I'll lose it.
Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't seem to do anything about it... How about you? Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinite gratitude, I can't even put it into words. I don't know if I would have survived otherwise. I think it also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the entire color and surface is scratched and there is a table leg impression. With the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website. We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me? If we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12#NUMBER#. However, it was not confirmed twice.
Mal was komplett anderes: I discovered in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography. For me, it was always something strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed. How do you feel about that?
Perhaps you can also talk about work or study colleagues with different attitudes. Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate them. It also provides a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity. What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? Preserving culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English as I understand it well. This has been going on for a long time, and I would rather avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I'm expecting a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hello dear people, I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I believe it is a film for young people. In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, there is modernity (the real world).
For another, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it anyway, there is a young woman. And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a story ensues. The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to that realm in order to survive, as I understand it. The transition, I believe, is also the gravesite of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept only on the stomach from week 1. Fast forward: still alive:D Relax.
A child is much more than one might think. Make sure everything around you is in order, no stuffed animals, go out and look more often, but no constant surveillance. That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows.
Acho and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket. Observe your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it be placed upright from the bottom? Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress? You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already "Stammkunde" (regular customer) with you and have already bought many articles. But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback yet. It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit in the wardrobe.
Please contact me as soon as possible. The cabinet is currently not usable.
To be quite clear, RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV as well. It's just that politics on this channel is now complete crap. Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then they still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: We want to be "no running billboard". What are we now?
In episode 0815 of the advertiser, he tries to bring his billboard merchandise to the elite fan. And then we have Marah's do's and don'ts, which of course apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, people can continue to be insulted. A bartender who lacks empathy and tries to make a mess of the rented premises at the expense of the action. How can all of this be resolved?
If you like it, I find it terrifying.
Please provide a callback, as my delivered wooden table is defective and has a broken corpus due to the damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
If as a comfort for an upset stomach or simply for snuggling - My little warm friend is versatilely usable. Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for pleasant warmth applications, as cherry pits absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled manner. The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft surface makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even when things don't go so well for them. The cherry-pit pillow with a soft surface is exclusively intended for the following application areas: Before heating the pillow, check for unusual odors, stains or burns and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cover for heating before inserting it into the microwave! Microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (following the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!) Shake the heat evenly throughout the cover after heating!
Afterwards, lay the inner cover in relation to the outer cover. During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications. Always adhere to the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy inputs can lead to damage (fire and burning hazard!).
Check whether it is allowed to heat corn products according to the manufacturer's usage instructions before microwaving the Kissens. Once the heated inner pad is placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the Kissens on your arm's elbow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C). Do not use the pad for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, bleeding, and open wounds, as well as for persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use. If seams open and kernels come loose, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and out of reach of children. If the product is applied to babies under 1 year old, the child's temperature should be regularly controlled during use to avoid overheating!
All incidents related to the product that have occurred should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority of the state in which the user is residing. The product is removable and washable at 30 °C in the machine. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after the second round - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf. Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
It's not going well for Ingolstadt even under the third coach either. Jubilation in Darmstadt after the late win in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead? Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) wouldn't charge through the power cord. This one I bought about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power supply alone would be enough to operate the laptop. Error message: the battery is empty and the laptop doesn't start even with the power supply plugged in. Therefore, I disassembled the battery, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in Wi-Fi mode? Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of #PRS\_ORG# brought into the room. How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat height is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design! With a capacity of 20 liters, it can easily accommodate larger photo equipment, which can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you might need for everyday objects is well-organized and easily accessible in the individually configurable interior, separate from the photo equipment. With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design is famous for being self-explanatory - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment.
It works with two options: conventionally through the flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a highly thought-out solution for effective protection that has proven itself in Messenger Bags. The locking flap has a metal locking lever with appropriate anchor bars on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken different "fill levels" into account: there are four anchor bars, securely riveted, into which the locking lever can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar. If it's relatively empty, take a deeper one. The zipper and hooks are also magnetic. This way, the backpack can be closed reliably without having to grip the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other backpacks, such as photo backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through your contents! At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you are not only taking your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear.
In Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more information below) and thus easily separate both compartments from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings. This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left compartment and do not get in between. Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And the outer shell of the backpack is completely made of 100% recyclable, waterproof Nylon, so the contents will stay dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I was waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# informed me yesterday that they had sent an email confirming the assignment of the contact person at the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
As of now, I have not received any message. Please proceed immediately. I am already writing with the third support employee, with none of them I got further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom order #NAME#.
It is unbearable to wait for the delivery of the wardrobe. Keeping it is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. Have a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture and not sent it back. And I couldn't have anticipated that the past year turned out differently and couldn't properly settle and clear it. But as a customer, I can't accept the damage.
Rottinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, taking into account reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions. Rottinger brake discs are manufactured by casting and then mechanically processed (bored and cut). All machined discs are produced in short series after individual technical properties, which are specific to certain discs and patterns, are manufactured.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on the expansion of the disc according to the properties of the original mounting. The thusly manufactured tuned discs ensure high comfort and braking performance. Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, where the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and sparked the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country. Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted a share in the wealth of the country.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself. You will be looking for gold, recruiting workers, gathering horses, and building companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas. You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory. You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works for you (known as "engine building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments. Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year California achieved statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their choice is revealed and they place their pawns on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pawns, it receives a block!
This deactivates one half of the location, reducing the possible actions there. Then, the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
At the beginning of each round, the bartender turns to a new location and changes the available actions. This continues until the bartender has moved five times, covering each location once and the year ends. There is a shootout in which the players must defend Coloma from a furious bandit attack.
When players have enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they receive rewards. However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the cemetery. The game ends after the third shootout, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins! With free shipping, I take items up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm in size, and the shipping method is a parcel (games included). For most other cases, DPD is usually used with shipping tracking (games included, wrapped in bubble wrap and packaging paper).
If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a box within a box for an additional fee of 2 euros, which ensures that there are no printing marks.
"Why children are not tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on child-rearing. Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please pay attention, the film is difficult to bear. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. To parents and other responsible adults, it should never, never, never be allowed to have power over a child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as is reasonable and possible in the given situation. Brrr, I still get shaken up.
Holetschek: Countries discuss removal of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide removal of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting. "We need clarity quickly, whether and when the testing requirement can be lifted for triple-vaccinated individuals," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The absence of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive," said Holetschek. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to propose, "that he will present a suggestion to the health ministers' conference on Tuesday." - AFP
I also want to send the lamp back. How should I proceed best?
Hello, I really like the #PRS\_ORG# chair, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can't complete any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG# account. Error message: Oh no, an error has occurred. Shopping through the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer works.
I have updated the cash data. What could be the reason for this?
As you describe it, it is referred to as *Awareness*, which refers to sensory perceptions under full anesthesia. These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000. The most common is hearing sounds/voices, followed by seeing images, and the least common is the perception of pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as to protect the child until birth, a very deep anesthesia is avoided. Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia methods, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex has no awareness by definition. I have misread their comment.
However, the chair is defective. Unfortunately, even the 20€ help us not. These are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair. That is besides the legal obligation also a standard in the area of eCommerce. Please check again whether they at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately. Then we will also lose some money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to. Again, the question. In the order and on the invoice, it states that the merchandise will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier service is Company #NAME#. I just called there, and they told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor. Will I be called?
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He became known as a theater critic and later as an intendant. He also wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97. There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older". The shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I bear witness here already my life's gratitude."
There are different types of palettes. One of the most common ones are European palettes, standardized wooden palettes that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria in 2020, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria. The production value was around 79 million euros. However, the number of palettes imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

Rolled Meat Tips & Tricks I received some great tips for the perfect goulash last week. It was served at Christmas and was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that! Now I've come around to the taste and I want to cook beef rolls for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I will set a beef stock.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is everything going? What about the books? How can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English is not as good as it used to be, but I'll manage.
The issue is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made. However, the money has not yet been received by me.
Please check that.
Where in Lübeck can you still get a Christmas roast? For many people, goose or duck is part of the Christmas season like the Christmas tree and gifts. Have you not yet purchased poultry?
Now it's getting tight. We'll tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can set the desired level and distortion of your sounds, respectively.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the volume without changing the "Gain" and distortion. As mentioned earlier, you can even make a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it gets too loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, you can fully utilize the potential of the VT+ series in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a box simulation so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly. An AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you therefore do not need a separate pitch control. If you want to spend extra money on a VFS5 foot switch, you can also comfortably call up sounds by foot, switch on/off the effect blocks, and adjust the tempo of the accordingly compatible effects "tap". For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
However, I have seen it differently. Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back? Since it is too low hanging for a dining table?
Sure, I'll help you translate the text from German to English. Here it is:  "Also ich würde sie dann gerne zurück schicken. Können Sie mir dabei weiter helfen?"  Translation:  "Also, I would like to send her back. Can you help me with that?"
And the wardrobe? Can we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher. Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture. I don't need more than 1,000 euros worth of items that I don't need.
I just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# Spiegel (door) mirror on the intended hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status with you?
Iran is making progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement According to Iranian statements, progress is being made in negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency IRNA.
This is a "positive and important development," as there was initially no agreement on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement aims to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks were resumed on Thursday after being suspended for almost a week.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations. A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.

As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence of over 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but remained above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within a day. 200 severely ill with Covid-19 were intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday.
During weekends, there may be reporting delays. In addition, health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, is that it or not? Here, I don't have to click/enter/fill anything else, right?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to kindly request that the return shipping be covered by you. An 8 euro return fee, in my opinion, is audacious.
It is time for changes.  Greetings, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!  What is the purpose of the post here?
When one looks at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one can conclude: it does not exist. We have come into a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for several months. #Where lies the problem?
Yes, what's the deal? In general, it seems to be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong and we're all just miserable. In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here are really looking forward to the MBundestag.
As we need to change something here, the community around the MBundestag has been asked who wants to keep this alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found a pile of brokenness.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community have come forward who want to rebuild the project. However, I would also like to expressly call upon everyone to participate, only in this way can the project continue to exist in the future. We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
The server can join through this link. Goals: * How should the MBundestag function in the future?
Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed? How will we appear to the outside world in the future? How will new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system? I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's okay, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let's democratically decide on our future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste. For this reason, I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope it will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as #NAME# is darker than expected.
I have a question: does the daily schedule #PRS\_ORG# also come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
PRS\_ORG must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly. And I kindly ask you to arrange for this to happen. I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for collection - they need to clarify with PRS\_ORG how this can work.
PRS\_ORG can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time would I need to assemble it or decide on returning it?
How do you answer the question why you are vegan? Today, I had a conversation with a colleague whom I really like. She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, eats meat very rarely now.
I myself was also previously a vegetarian for several years. When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought. And the answer was, that I had long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal suffering with it.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. In that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction was rising on their side, they then defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and that as vegetarians they could reduce animal suffering. Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question? I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without one wanting it. It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is not a unique exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am the assigned date on which #PRS\_ORG# is supposed to collect my return not in person. Since I cannot be present in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either. Please assign me an alternative pickup date.
Since 01.02.#NUMBER#, I have been consistently meeting again.
The Lahnstein defense for water rescue is prepared: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a subsidy decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new equipment vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein at Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security. I am glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this, says the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte. The diving vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks on and under water in water and ice rescue, as well as in technical assistance. In Lahnstein, permanent increases are expected: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, so it is. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June. Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to this whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar job, i.e. we were also armed guards in the executive branch, furthermore, I don't want to go into that either! The question of right and left always seems to me to be oversimplified. However, generally speaking, one should say that of course the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it's also natural for people in uniform and carrying weapons to be attracted to conservatism and right-wing ideology. It should be clear to everyone that these people naturally have difficulty dealing with everyday reality. Of course, it's also clear, because besides the average white person, there are now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and even homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you). And I have to rely on these people as well, because in the end, they may save your life or set it up for you. But even these marginalized groups also represent, according to my experience, a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel themselves less affected by excessive left-wing politics, even though these policies are supposedly meant to help them. They just want to be treated normally. As for the right-wing, of course, the police and the armed forces are a cross-section of society, and you will also find extreme right-wingers there who openly express their opinions or even openly
Of course, it also happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad start to generalize and also say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. It also happens that right-wing compatriots meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas. Nevertheless, such things are generally well fought against and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is also good, in my opinion, that we couldn't possibly have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, if there's something I don't understand, I've also ordered the other basket from the German side. Why should it come from England? When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available. I previously chatted with #NAME#. Alternatively, could one of the other #PRS_ORG# baskets for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany as well?
I always find you as a partner company.
but there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part that are filled with something yellow and on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch
Ordinary by child? Hallo, I (w32) have been dealing with a matter for a longer time. I am very disciplined and organized (independent, very little free time), but since my whole life I have had trouble maintaining a clean and orderly household permanently.
There are always phases where everything stays put, and every now and then, it hits me, and I tidy up and clean. But it's never really like "someone could drop by spontaneously." My husband (unfortunately) isn't better either; it bothers me somewhere, but mostly, household just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is regularly cleaned because we like to cook. Now, have you managed to become organized with children? We haven't had any yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a longer time.
Because for me, there is no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable. Do you have more motivation or are you just being lazy? I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality, anatomically pre-formed cut offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and enables almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-formed with special, further pressing at the joints for improved mobility (at arm- and knee bending) The Focea Comfort 4 was developed for the Flex System 2, where the covered area by the Flex System was more than doubled to further enhance comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends) High-quality pre-shaped panels in the lower back and in the step ensure a close-fitting, perfect sitting position. Elastikin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar region increases flexibility around the back closure and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and setting up equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection. Positioned on the chest, it provides warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Relentless, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face near the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet cover) Soft, collar-located zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the lining or stitching Double cuffs with zipper at arm and ankle joints connect a detachable inner cuff with a soft, neoprene outer cuff

Edges of the outer straps decorated for greater durability Edges of the inner straps embossed for increased flexibility The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer at its place, specifically for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a self-confident personality disorder? I have a training in software development and have been out of education for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right fit for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting over and studying social work for a while now.
The problem: I have a self-assured (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS). This means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-worth and as a result, I am shy. I have no problem talking to people on a professional level, but it is very difficult for me to engage in casual conversations and I have been told multiple times that I come across as aloof (which I believe I have already improved upon).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as substance abuse counseling or family support. However, I don't know if the actual working day is like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find information about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems for me in my job (emotionally), as it always brings me down when there is something wrong with my code ("even the simplest things are messed up") and it is difficult for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do it"/"I'm holding him back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.). I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But have you already held onto the sofa? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup. What do you mean by returning it, please?
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, does the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book is there a problem?" appear?
I was chatting with #PRS\_ORG# who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein (protein) taken up with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and from these, the bird builds again its own protein components, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the animal's overall organism. Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can otherwise disrupt the breeding process.
After the generous gift of NEKTON-Bio, it is recommended to switch to daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation). The protein taken with the food is broken down in the bird's digestive tract into individual amino acids, which are then used to build the bird's own protein structures, which are also needed for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regrowth in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the bird's entire body.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding process. After the brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply should be resumed with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement). For every 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food, use 1 g of NEKTON-Bio.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily. A marked measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. At the beginning, if there are severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After the normal dose is measured until the feather regeneration is completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break down after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged upon arrival and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws  Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree needs to be felled. Therefore, a felling application has been submitted to the community. An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including the walnut, is not part of the bylaws.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaw. Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not? On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaw is unique. Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message. No problem, then I still have a sofo without use. Could you offer me a surplus or a coupon?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I can help you with that. Here's the translation:  "Yes, I think so, the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the roof shipped to Germany. Can you check that?"
Notification: Serious traffic accident in Selb A serious traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the exit Selb-Nord and Plößberg. According to the press alert of the police, which is currently being circulated (14:03 hours), a car was overtaking in the opposite direction.
There are injured people.
Okay, I understand. Thanks again for making it so easy!
Merry Christmas to you! Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought.
Before I start here, briefly: I need advice and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - so from you. I am currently doing the Ref as a newcomer. Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (at least somewhat anonymously, I don't want to mention anything more specific).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun. Eventually, I ended up at the Ministry of Education and was sure that's where I wanted to be - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me. I'm now at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it's been half a year now. Before that, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the refrain, after which I could still turn around. But right now, I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now, although it is vacation, there is still a pile of work waiting for me. Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my day off and my holiday was my holiday.
At that point, I was free. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now, even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more. Basically, it's fun and the feedback is good from the outside. But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I ask myself if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had the freedom to take time off when I needed it, and worked together as a team on something, rather than as a lone fighter like now. But then I ask myself if I wouldn't be back in the same place a year from now, feeling unfulfilled. You can see, it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps you, as outsiders, can give me advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation where I'm completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make any decisions right now as I am feeling very emotional, which is likely to lead to nothing good. However, perhaps your views can help me at least see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amplifiers, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology) technology, which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This design partly relies on genuine analog circuits because these can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed in such a way that all guitarists in search of maximum sound diversity will hit the jackpot. All guitarists dream of the compression and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed based on this finding the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine, but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure parts, it adapts entirely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras. What ultimately fits into the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens. A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash unit.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for more lenses. Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items.
Even drone pilots find a perfect match with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history. In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday. So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in the year 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. No reliable data are available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dare not make a forecast as to when it might end. The indicators point to a slowdown. The best news is that they are stable, said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
In the three months since the eruption began, the hotter than 1000 degrees Celsius lava has destroyed almost 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares have been covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
Almost 1,700 football fields. More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros. Due to solidified lava, two new land tongues with an area of approximately 50 hectares were created off the coast.
Heavily affected was the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption. 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely damaged, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts are at the door, and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive quality combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas belongs to one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "society-binding contract" between natural peoples, can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life within the context of this tradition. Just as Nicholas became the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it were the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift-giving. Prior to that, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in a more or less discreet manner. The background of this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, the bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of giving arose in Germany the popular custom of filling children's shoes with gifts. Protestants object to this custom because they reject it as "Holy Worship." For this reason, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus founded a new tradition line. The focus of giving shifted to Christmas Eve as a result. Since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only annoys the fewest that the custom of St. Nicholas is still as firm a part of the pre-Christmas season as the Martin tradition with Martin singing and Martin's procession.
Today, one can find everything one's heart desires at the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches. The diversity of traditions in Christian countries can be traced back to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the feast day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, there is a joyful confusion in all Christian-influenced countries about who brings the gifts to the children now. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a Santa Claus with some unique characteristics.
For example, Saint Nicholas' white beard has little in common with the more strict Assyrian hairstyle of the historical figure, his sleigh is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost some fame. Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh. In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.
Receive since 3 weeks, when trying to download a new book, this error message, my account details and contact details are up-to-date: Please help with error resolution, otherwise I will buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#.
I have asked for a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning. I was told that one would be sent to me. However, I have not received it yet (it was not in the SPAM folder either). Now, I would like to inquire about how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace In London, near the Kensington Palace, a man armed with a weapon was shot by the police on Saturday. The police reported that callers had reported a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookkeeper's business.
The man fled according to authorities in a vehicle that was stopped by officials shortly thereafter. Shots were fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not proceed from a terrorist background. In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages have been established. The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Additional members of the royal family also live there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I will be redirected to your page immediately.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden. The light is simply placed and can be anchored with 2 earth spikes in the ground. Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum brightness duration 10 minutes - The robust plastic manufacturing is fully usable outdoors all year round. In Hollywood speak, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with colorful light.
However, "Smart Stone" is different: Only the sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The angular, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a large pebble shaped by nature, this modern light object presents itself during the day. Its organic rounded shapes fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the gravel bed.
He does well even among larger pebbles and boulders, where he can maintain his position due to his size. You can save yourself a lot of work: as a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries. Just place the "lightstone" on any sunny spot in the garden.
Two included ground spikes provide a secure hold when needed. The matte white plastic housing itself is robust and weather-resistant. Its solar module conceals "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colorful light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing. When dusk approaches, "Smart Stone" automatically starts to glow; in which color, that's up to you: You have a choice of six attractive light colors - besides daylight white - to choose from. And the shutting off finally happens automatically as soon as the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I have already done it multiple times, but it doesn't work.
Sorry, I would have liked to order more from you, but if the voucher is not credited, then I will not order from principle. If you change your mind, please let me know. Otherwise, today was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard. In the lockdown, the hardware store hasn't opened either...
The motor control of LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.

Pillenproblem Hello dear female audience, I hope I'm doing everything right, it's actually my first post after a year.
Regarding my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pain during my period and PMS before my period. Now I would like to stop again because I already have to take so many medications due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose for myself. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten during my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100 explosively acne and these all over my face. So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel well. During the two-year break, nothing really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this. My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without noise, but maybe someone can recommend something to me. The female doctor didn't take me seriously and I still have to make an appointment with the dermatologist.
Thank you very much to everyone who read the novel! Yes, the skin is such a thing. I had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread cystic acne and the acne topic.
Nutrition, I have also tried everything possible during my Christian illness, and I am still on a mixed diet of sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else worked well. It could also be that hormonally there is simply a worm inside, but if you want to have a construction site everywhere, you would rather not look for what else is wrong.
I had already written everything to my colleague's seminar o. ä. and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern. I have to work in between and on the phone and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money were there? I would have seen it. Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
However, he is generally available in large size since he is available in black in large size.

In the name of the people: Laypeople hand down judgments. In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench. But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Jurors decide with professional judges how long someone will be behind bars.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately, I am unable to access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# one more time to the above-mentioned email address?
What can we do with the packaging material? We don't have the option to store it for so long. We would use the table as if it were offered to us, as if it were ours.
Sure, here's the translation:  "Already in November of the same year, I had ordered two in blue and received them. Therefore, I would like to have one in gray now."
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
10-kV earth cable will be newly built in 2022 The approval for the placement of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid. The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria makes the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now shared the following information. The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a pole of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part with us. The blue betselling number: #PRS\_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me how the next process is? Have a great start to the week!
You can forget about that, I have already explained it several times yesterday! It is a glass commode, and all sides are covered with glass, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken. The commode is in my apartment, and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
That means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request is made at #PRS\_ORG# since it probably involves a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues, I have been at the Ref since summer and teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems with time-efficiently planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I basically only use the blackboard, the schoolbook, and an OHP as media. In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography). I currently just need to spend a very long time planning my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself. In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I always plan from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and think about how I can build it up (usually I create an worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied. Therefore, also the worksheets. Maybe I can get some tips from a geography teacher on how to work time-efficiently with the book.
I would be truly delighted.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. Although I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for Christmas business. In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered can enter. The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about loss of sales.
He also has a possible solution. According to the German Retail Association (HDE), the 2G rules damage the important Christmas business for the retail trade. Umsatzeinbrüche (sales losses) should be expected for businesses dealing with non-daily necessities, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many would have written off the Christmas business already. "What should actually be the positive peak of the year, is now often a hole without a bottom," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G restrictions lost almost a third of their turnover in the past week. Only the food retail trade and online sales are doing well. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director. "2G shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations scared customers and required a high personnel effort.
He demanded that the wristband regulation be approved nationwide. Then, each customer would only need to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the received wristband on that day. Additionally, in retail - as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, also spoke of difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona level, and the sales at around 90%. These numbers are now sure to fall during the crucial Christmas season, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approvals obtained for the centers. This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, would once present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel, be able to enter all businesses unrestricted." dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS\_ORG# and received it. The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error on the frame that was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler. That looks unsightly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it. How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance construction based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high performance and high color rendering. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is responsible for adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp. In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp generates a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The 120-degree radiation angle allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, which is excellent. By the way, it is also suitable for reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Furthermore, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
Applicator storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To execute the settings of individual settings on the storage spots, simply press and hold one of the storage keys and ready. The storage controller stores the current state of the lamp when turning off, so that when new power is turned on, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
One of the biggest advantages of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with affordable NP-FAK batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also check whether the batteries have sufficient performance before use - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display indicators (the upper display for the left battery, the lower display for the right battery).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the flash with power through the included transformer. The construction of the flash is very simple. It has a 16mm thread for attachment, allowing you to secure it directly to your photography tripod.
The inclination can be reliably established using measuring instruments on both sides. It has been taken into account that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use. Additionally, a tilting joint is included in the delivery.
Great, the delivery also includes a bag. So you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to purchase without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, that we wanted to spit on": Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt. After 22 minutes, the last twice champions of Germany seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga relegation.
But then the SGE turned around, shot itself within an hour of frustration over a disappointing start of the season and won fiercely with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have accomplished today," coach Oliver Glasner celebrated with DAZN and praised "a collective effort, to everyone who was involved." It initially looked like another setback for the still ninth-placed Frankfurt. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach. "As the players returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued. I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Even defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game and overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I think our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old and particularly enjoyed the result for the spectators. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation. It is extraordinary that all players are fit in December and all players are physically in top condition. It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "move forward step by step and stay humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level". Next up is already on Wednesday as part of the English week, an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (7:30 PM, Sky).
I received the email that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my side. I tried to have it redirected at #PRS\_ORG#, but there was no chance. Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and I can place the order again?
For me, unfortunately, it would mean that I wouldn't order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Dampener for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain Germany's handball women slipped after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks from the court. At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a harsh defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," coach Henk Groener judged. Against Spain, we must act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as second behind Denmark (10:0)."
It's unfortunate that we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game that we need to erase, said Captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for a place in the semi-finals on Monday, there must be a significant improvement to keep the delicate dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best German female shooter in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Rückraumspielerin Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," said Rückraumspielerin Xenia Smits and called for: "We must now quickly look ahead." From the front to the back not on the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at their best at the start. Misses and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0-4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on high alert and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels finished a quick counter-attack successfully. However, this was not the desired ignition. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
So the game at 3:10 in the morning was prematurely ended after 20 minutes due to a hard foul by Mia Zschocke on her opponent, resulting in her receiving a red card. However, she will be able to participate in the quarterfinals. The German handball team did not play well in the first half, but they did manage to score five goals before the break.
The already quiet hope for a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes of the 9:19 game. Again, the Greener protégés were at fault in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent who counts among the medal contenders at the end of the season. As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

The title is given, I am employed as a mobile vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these are soon to be completed, it goes on to part of the vaccination centers for me. I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility is the information on vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical staff. However, in vaccination teams, we often do not have doctors but rather pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot (or may not?) perform vaccinations themselves, so that I also perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Helper" question: Amberg knows the solution. What is a "Helper"? With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, a heavy thought has been stirred up in the BR television show "We in Bavaria".
However, unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained unrecognized by the callers this time. No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And neither was it someone who "has to get everything done quickly".
As people heard from the TV presenter, it was completely wrong. The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus probably caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate residents. "The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a cloth used to wipe the stove."
Dialectologist Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for many years, confirmed this. With the comment that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern". With this, a gap in education was closed - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books for the past 2 weeks. After confirmation, I always get the following error message: "oops - something went wrong - try again later." I have restarted the #PRS_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Is tire choice when cycling really as safe as advertised? This morning, I woke up full of determination, wanting to at least train a little for my upcoming cycling tour next week. Well, I did it and I rode my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) happened. Glass splinters on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the route on no account.
Because of the day of the week, I didn't have a real opportunity to get a spare jacket and spare tube, so I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home. It wasn't technically that bad, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the bike ride again. But now I'm facing a question and hoping that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would be very unhappy to encounter this problem frequently. Now it wasn't really bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had 140km on them when I picked up the bike at 10:12 am!) were already considered suboptimal, as he had been riding on them for several years. However, when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km of riding, I think I'll be in a pretty bad mood: :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform about why I don't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unrepairable. Of course, that all sounds very tempting. But are they really that indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire right now, only to be disappointed. Furthermore, I ask myself: when I was on the racing bike, I believed I had 25x622. Although it is also available (apparently) at the Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend other tires to me for a racing bike? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! I have more knowledge about the Durano DD.  Translation:  Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend other tires to me for a racing bike? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! I have more knowledge about the Durano DD.
Thank you very much in advance for the help and lovely greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and collided with a central island.

Hello everyone,  Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST this year! Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
At least three people will be present per switch, so that we can accompany the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you will follow us! > We do our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will be around 0:30 when it happens. Prepare your drinks in advance, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
