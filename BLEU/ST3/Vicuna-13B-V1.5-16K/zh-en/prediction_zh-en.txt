众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。这个时候便是需要急救的时候。如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！

ASSISTANT: As we all know, after an accident, the process of an ambulance arriving takes some time, and it is precisely during this time that it is the most critical. This is the time when we need emergency treatment. If I were to really experience a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!

所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。“在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。

ASSISTANT: So having someone nearby who knows first aid is really important! When someone nearby collapses, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of just standing there helplessly, unable to do anything. The feeling of helplessness is too scary. "In China, we have official data showing that there are 300,000 accidental deaths each year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest."

ASSISTANT: If someone experiences cardiac arrest with no breathing and no pulse, CPR is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to potentially save the person's life. I have found that we currently have very few people who are aware of the importance of learning first aid, but when an emergency arises, it is too late. Therefore, I call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.

重庆中职学校试点现代学徒制 入学即是企业准员工-新华网昨天，记者从市教委获悉，今年起，我市将在60所中职学校试点“现代学徒制”人才培养模式，接受试点培养的学生同时具备学徒身份，招生录入后将被试点企业预录为单位员工。市教委要求，规范中职学校招生录取和企业用工程序，明确学徒的中职学校学生和企业准员工双重身份，按照双向选择原则，学徒、学校和企业签订三方协议，对于年满16周岁未达到18周岁的学徒，须由学徒、监护人、学校和企业四方签订协议，确定各方权益及学徒在岗培养的具体岗位、教学内容、权益保障等。

ASSISTANT: Chongqing has launched a pilot program for modern apprenticeships in vocational schools. Starting this year, 60 vocational schools in the city will try out the new model of talent cultivation, in which students who are admitted to the schools will also have the status of trainees in enterprises. After being recruited and registered, the trainees will be pre-employed by the designated enterprises. The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures of vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the double identity of students as both vocational school students and trainee employees be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual choice, tripartite agreements will be signed between the trainees, schools, and enterprises. For trainees who are over 16 but under 18 years old, agreements must be signed by the trainees, their guardians, schools, and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the on-the-job training of the trainees.

ASSISTANT: As a pilot period for the vocational education system, the internship time for students is determined according to the talent cultivation plan for professionals in enterprises, and the peak internship generally lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented, and according to the different characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each rotation of the post. According to the arrangement, from August 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 municipal-level intermediate vocational student pilot sites in three batches, with a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。

ASSISTANT: South African doctors: Omicron's transmission power is strong, but most cases are mild

Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province said that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.

虽然收集足够的数据还需要几个星期的时间，但医生的观察和早期证据提供了一些线索。据南非国家传染病研究所总结：在近几周住院的新冠患者中，只有30%是严重病症，是前一波疫情重症比例的一半；平均住院时间从8天缩短到2.8天；近期的新冠患者中，仅有3%死亡，而在南非早期爆发的病例中，死亡比例达20 % 。非洲健康研究所所长威廉·哈内科姆（Willem Hanekom）引用国家传染病研究所的数据和其他报告说 ： “ 目前，几乎所有的迹象都表明，这是一种较温和的疾病 。 ”

ASSISTANT: Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the observations of doctors and early evidence have provided some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate among the early outbreak cases in South Africa reached 20%.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。

ASSISTANT: I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to practice with a racket that's not too expensive first. Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish between them, it's normal for expensive rackets to be more friendly than cheap ones. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have very low intensity, when the ball hits the racket head, it vibrates a lot, and the hard racket can't hold up. Even professionals have a hard time controlling them.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

ASSISTANT: The logic and underlying message are - tennis is so difficult, you can't learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so I'll cheat you with cheap ones. You'll play twice and never play again. That way, this racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad. When you can really distinguish good from bad, it means you've progressed, and then you can come back and buy the expensive ones from me. I'll make twice the money. I suggest spending a similar price to buy a second-hand good racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets can't be sold at high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 is already good, and a second-hand one for 200, isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a thousand-dollar racket?

江西３年内将培训万名乡村小学音体美教师-新华网新华社南昌５月２２日电（记者陈毓珊）记者近日从江西省教育厅获悉，为增强紧缺学科教师队伍保障能力，实现乡村义务教育均衡发展，自２０１６年起，江西省规划用３年时间为全省乡村（乡镇及以下）每所小学培训合格的音乐、美术、体育教师各１名，共计１万名。据了解，这次培训对象为江西全省乡村小学４５岁以下具有音乐、美术、体育学科知识基础或才能，能兼任音乐、美术、体育课程的其他学科教师。

ASSISTANT: Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural elementary school physical education teachers in the next three years-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Nanchang May 22nd (Reporter Chen Yuxuan) According to a report from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, in order to strengthen the shortage of subject teachers and ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, since 2016, Jiangxi Province has planned to train 10,000 qualified music, art, and physical education teachers for primary schools in the entire province within three years. It is understood that the target of this training is for primary school teachers in rural areas of Jiangxi Province who are under 45 years old and have a basic knowledge or talent in music, art, and physical education. They can also serve as teachers of other subjects in addition to music, art, and physical education courses.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通过培训，使他们掌握音体美学科教学的基本知识和教学技能，更新教学思想和观念，掌握现代教学方法，提高学科教学能力、活动设计能力、校园文化能力及自我发展能力，建设一支一专多能的音体美教师队伍，缓解乡村音体美教师缺乏的问题。为确保培训质量和效果，江西还规划为全省１００个县（市、区）小学音乐、美术、体育各培训１名，共计３００名培训者，全面提升他们的教学示范引领能力、教研活动设计组织能力、施训能力、网络研修工作坊建设能力，起到教授、示范、指导、监督的作用。

ASSISTANT: Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of aesthetics education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, grasp modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of versatile aesthetics educators to alleviate the problem of shortage of aesthetics educators in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to train 100 primary school music, art, and physical education teachers in each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, a total of 3,000 trainees, comprehensively improving their teaching demonstration and leadership ability, teaching research activity design organization ability, training ability, and network training workshop construction ability, playing a teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising role.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。

ASSISTANT: In fact, there is a lot of emphasis on clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls with heavier bodies, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, which can cover the fleshy part of the thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the excess flesh on the thighs.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。

ASSISTANT: Wearing clothes that are too long can give people a feeling of being short and fat. If you cut out the top, middle, and bottom sections in different colors, it will appear that you have naturally grown taller. For example, using a different color for the upper body, skirt, and long socks can create a sense of being tall. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide excess weight. A noble and elegant black mini skirt is also a favorite choice for chubby girls.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。

ASSISTANT: Wearing clothes in dark colors, especially black short skirts, can make you look slimmer. If you have fat legs, don't make your socks and shoes too noticeable. The more popular it is, the better. The color should not be too eye-catching either.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: In order to avoid people noticing your legs and feet, it's important to give off a feeling of being overweight. For slightly overweight girls, there are some tricks to dressing that are worth sharing. Don't wear tight-fitting short skirts, and avoid tops that are too short or stuffed into your skirt, as this can make you look uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black opaque tights or grid tights (the kind with finer grids). Choose A-line skirts with floral prints, and pair them with a blouse with a ruffled collar. This can effectively hide the shortcomings of an overweight girl.

当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔!

ASSISTANT: Of course, even the chubby girl can be particular about her outfit when wearing a short skirt. When a chubby girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make her figure look taller. Paired with high heels, it can make your legs look longer, which is the IN thing of the summer!

如果你是上身胖，但腿很瘦的MM，推荐选择华丽感的连衣短裙。不但能遮住大肚皮，更能展现你的优点。A字短裙会很显瘦，比较适合胖女孩，上衣要选择紧身一些的，形成层次感会更显瘦。

ASSISTANT: If you are a bit heavier on top but have slim legs, I recommend choosing a fancy short dress. Not only can it cover your belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. An A-line dress will look slimming, which is more suitable for chubby girls. For the top, choose something that fits a bit tighter to create a sense of layering, which will make you look even slimmer.

ASSISTANT: More than 130 Asian American organizations in the US submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, accusing three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - of discriminating against Asian American applicants in their admission process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. - Xu Jianmei, Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23rd.

该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of top American universities has increased many times over, but the proportion of Asians in these three top American universities has remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and persistently discriminated against Asian applicants in their so-called "holistic" admission process. Zhao Yu Kong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asians was the lowest compared to the number of applicants of all ethnicities.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。

ASSISTANT: According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in recruitment. They also hope that the universities being sued will take the issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.

ASSISTANT: Currently, the three colleges that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yuejia Town, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and signed a "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Agreement." The agreement stipulated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit of 200,000 yuan would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week.

然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: However, after that, both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory's sale and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house purchase contract. Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu had prepared for the house purchase, including the deposit and the down payment, but the seller did not sign the contract, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。一审判决后，原告提起上诉。

ASSISTANT: For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yuyang Municipal People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double compensation for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.

近日，二审法院维持原判。【律师提醒】 在交易过程中要尽到必要的审慎注意义务。在签订合同时，作为买方要尽到必要的审慎注意义务，比如，核实房屋所有权人信息、房屋是否被人占用等相关信息，并在合同中明确关于交付的具体时间、地点，以防履行合同时双方产生争议。

ASSISTANT: Recently, the Second Circuit Court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due diligence. As the buyer, you should exercise due diligence in verifying information such as the ownership of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information when signing the contract. It is also necessary to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。

ASSISTANT: 320 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (Sabah, Malaysia, November 11, 2022) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper being exposed to light, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 babies. However, the department's director, K. Aminu, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the counterfeit-proof paper arrives next week.

"One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivery to our country."

ASSISTANT: He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' inventory. Kirau Aminuys revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。

ASSISTANT: The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening the epidemic prevention and control of the novel coronavirus in port cities along the land border. It stipulates that persons who have recently left port cities along the land border (excluding those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) must present a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and persons traveling to port cities along the land border must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the port city scope by each province, district, and municipality to March 15, 2022.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the notice also proposes that conditionally open ports can study setting epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions. The person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Agency introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support, and the exchange between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies based on regions, a single line of epidemic prevention and control can become two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the advance of the border epidemic prevention and control, reduce the spread of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。

ASSISTANT: Recently, there have been several local clustered outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry. The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposes some problems such as insufficient and untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some localities, non-implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disposal of cold-chain products at all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the weak links in port city epidemic prevention and control, to scientifically and accurately carry out epidemic prevention and control work and tighten the external prevention and control line.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and civilian livelihood protection work, publicize and open up civilian livelihood protection hotlines, regularly identify potential risks in the supply of basic life necessities and prices, and actively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public. According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly administered municipalities where they are situated. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。

ASSISTANT: Don't scare people off at the starting line - When browsing bookstores, one can often sense the popularity of success-oriented books. Many of the success-oriented books that are currently popular emphasize the "best principles" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。

ASSISTANT: Let me translate the text from Chinese to English:

Which means that we need to talk about the most important and fundamental aspect, which is "how to do it". Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are fully committed to doing their best, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either they climb Mount Tai, or they just wait in place. This "best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people are intimidated before they even start.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。

ASSISTANT: Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a decision to transform yourself and make a 180-degree change," which is exactly the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who are conservative, stick to the old ways, and refuse to change, you will have to shout loudly in their ears "you must transform," which is undoubtedly self-deception and beating a dead horse. Most people will be afraid to take the first step and hesitant to make a decision when faced with the word "transformation." Alternatively, they may make a hasty decision to transform and take the first step, but it often doesn't last long, and they quickly lose momentum and fall behind. It is difficult to see any sustainability in this.

马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue "Starting from Tomorrow" perfectly embodies the classic representation of "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limit of what most people can achieve, leaving them feeling frustrated. Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a more feasible path for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。

ASSISTANT: The core principle of "the next good thing" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100%, doing 1% is also fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand hill in front of your house is also fine, because that is also better than staying in the same place. In any case, as long as you do something, it is stronger than not doing anything. Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as you persevere, the probability of success will also increase.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: The road to success following the "second-best principle" may be a bit longer, but it can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people. Although the "best principle" appears to be a banner for making everyone successful on the surface, in reality, it can only effectively motivate a few; while the "second-best principle" can motivate more people.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。

ASSISTANT: The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results, reaching 108,500 tons, with a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the protected initial period in 2002. Naked carp, also known as "Yangtze River fish", is a rare and valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human activities such as large-scale killing and degradation of the breeding environment, the number of Tibetan antelopes in the Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the reserve of Qinghai Lake Tibetan antelopes was only 2,592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake Tibetan antelopes were listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the "Closure of Qinghai Lake for Breeding Fish", prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from catching or selling Tibetan antelopes and their products in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。

ASSISTANT: At the same time, through artificial breeding and releasing and cleaning the main river channels of the rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has been increasing annually. The deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of 1.8 billion naked carp have been artificially bred and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing to the recovery rate of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources exceeding 23%. The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water source nurturing area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone for controlling the spread of western desertification to the east.

为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。

ASSISTANT: In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, and to protect the aquatic wildlife, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。

ASSISTANT: Taking a foot bath and getting an electric shock from the bubbles? Choosing the right foot bath basin can have excellent therapeutic and health effects on the feet. Today, the editor of Jumei will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, providing consumers with a wide range of choices, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。

ASSISTANT: In related data, compared with traditional home appliances, sales of health-related home appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet. Mr. Li tried using a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。

ASSISTANT: Because he found that this popular foot bath basin has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of applicable population, materials guaranteeing safety at the highest temperature setting, etc. However, generally speaking, foot bath basins do not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a modular foot bath basin.

水电分离，没有任何安全隐患。同时你可以随便拿电笔测。

中国工程院院士刘仲华教授在开幕式上隆重推介：湖红之源在新化，红茶崛起为“五彩湘茶”注入新动力。近年来，省委、省政府大力支持茶产业发展，推进千亿湘茶产业建设，形成“三湘四水五彩茶”的发展格局。省内茶界加大创新，绿茶、黑茶、红茶等主力茶类轮番发力，主产茶区推进茶旅融合，带动广大茶农增收。

ASSISTANT: Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in new industries, and the rise of red tea injects new impetus as "Five-color Tea of Xiang". In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-dollar Xiang tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five-color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have taken turns to launch. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving a large increase in income for tea farmers.

风水轮流转，红茶又发力。省内茶界专家称，采完绿茶采红茶、黑茶，茶农一年四季有收入，茶园产值直线上升。在开幕式上，省领导为第四批获权使用“湖南红茶”商标的企业进行授牌，新化喜捧“湖红之源 ” 。

ASSISTANT: The winds of fortune shift, and red tea is making a comeback. Provincial tea experts say that by harvesting green tea and black tea, tea farmers can have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens is on the rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Lake Red Tea" trademark, and welcomed the launch of "Lake Red Tea's Origin".

在新化红茶展馆，福建茶商看中一款名为“冰里春”的高山茶，当即下订单。省茶业协会秘书长王准高兴地说，当前疫情等因素或多或少影响茶叶市场，但从茶博会现场看，亮点纷呈。新化红茶一抹红，注入了茶文化内涵，人气旺、交易火，湘茶产业喜迎新的春天。

ASSISTANT: In the New Xihu Red Tea Museum, a tea merchant from Fujian saw a high mountain tea named "Ice in Spring" and immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Fujian Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with joy that the tea market has been affected to some extent by the epidemic and other factors, but from the tea exhibition, it can be seen that there are many highlights. The New Xihu Red Tea has a touch of red, injecting the tea culture connotation, and the popularity is high, the transaction is hot. The Changsha tea industry welcomes the new spring with enthusiasm.

However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. Training is an even better choice for them.

要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

ASSISTANT: If you have a strong self-study ability, you can also choose to learn on your own, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the institution's faculty strength. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the institution has no meaning. Of course, the faculty strength of some newly opened training institutions may not be very strong.

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before making a decision, it's a good idea to investigate this training institution. It's best to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution, because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the courses are. I don't know how to answer your question, to be honest, because you haven't introduced your own situation. Learning this stuff is closely related to your personal circumstances, such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you're in. These factors will all be related to the industry you want to work in.

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

ASSISTANT: If you are a student who has not yet graduated or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many training institutions both offline and online, but the cost of learning is high and the time investment is quite large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. However, if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili to find training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultations. In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining videos.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of study fees and time costs, it is recommended that you go to a training institution to learn. This way of learning does not have to be very tiring, and the teachers will explain in detail. If you have any questions, there will be people dedicated to answering them, and in terms of study planning or supervision, there will also be assistance. Moreover, nowadays many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after studying, so you can save a lot of trouble in the interview process for finding a job later on. The above are my views on this matter. Since I don't know your specific situation, I only gave a general introduction, and if you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication and discussion.

A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the biennale. The biennale was co-curated by the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Yan Xiaoyu, serving as the artistic director.

据策展团队介绍，本次双年展的主题为“摸着石头过河 ” ， 隐喻社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当下境遇。本次双年展占地近12000平方米，展厅横跨六个相互连接的建筑，以六个单元呈现 ： 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 。其中，27位沙特艺术家的作品数量占本次展品总量的四成以上，囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品同样备受关注，有的艺术家以新颖的方式使用回收材料进行创作，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图 》 （ 2014）中，用废弃物重构了一幅经典山水画。

ASSISTANT: According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Touching Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and also reflects the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings displaying works in six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, with some artists using innovative ways to create with recycled materials, such as Ice using discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in his "Behind the Story Series: Endless Mountains and Rivers" (2014).

迪里耶双年展基金会首席执行官巴克利表示，希望本届双年展能够建立国际对话，让全球观众有机会了解沙特蓬勃发展的文化产业和创意社区，加强互动往来。田霏宇说 ： “ 双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特观众融入当代艺术世界 。 ”据了解，在双年展开幕周期间还将举办系列讲座，艺术家、策展人和创意行业的意见领袖将就跨文化交流、当代艺术发展等主题展开讨论。

ASSISTANT: Diriyah Biennale Foundation CEO Bakri said he hoped this year's biennale could establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural and creative industries and creative communities, and enhancing interaction. Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is double, on the one hand, it allows contemporary Saudi art to participate in the global dialogue, on the other hand, it allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, in which artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Regulate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bi Feng) To continue to do a good job in helping poverty-stricken populations find employment and to consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the revitalization of rural areas and the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. According to relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human and Social Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welf01
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

ASSISTANT: This regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, the National Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and four other departments. It mainly standardizes the object of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, position development, position management, and other aspects. In terms of position development, the regulation clearly stipulates that positions should be developed according to the principle of "needs-based, position-based, dynamic management, and total quantity control" and the principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary public announcement, and unified management." The recruitment process must follow the steps of public announcement, application, review, public notice, employment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the relevant departments to supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions. The regulations also stipulate that the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for the personnel in rural public welfare positions, and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

ASSISTANT: Although the rightists had a period of triumph in history, it was not long-lasting. They flourished when they received a little sunshine and sweated when they drank a little water. As soon as they achieved their goals, they would be attached to the leftists. However, when it comes to seeking the truth, the rightists played a positive role in the social progress. From defining the truth standard to developing the economy, promoting technological advancement, and promoting the institutionalization and protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: Three, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I'm very interested in what he has to say, and I also respect him as a person. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes a serious look at China's social issues. But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, chaos in political groups, and finally, foreign powers taking advantage of the situation.

Four, to change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who attempt political speculation and try to take advantage of the situation are not right-wingers, they are just a bunch of idiots.

ASSISTANT: Let's talk about this again. The left, in fact, is a group of orphans of the times and politics. If it can be said that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when necessary. But the left doesn't have this kind of thinking, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!

ASSISTANT: Recently, I have seen some friends who are both against traitors and against leftists, and they are still very passionate about it. I think it's not necessary. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both one-dimensional, and there's no point in reasoning with them.

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the counter-revolutionaries curse you for five mao and the leftists curse you as a rightist dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but later forgot them or pursued them to the point of becoming dogmatic. Some even started out as heroic young dragon-slayers, but ended up as evil dragons.

ASSISTANT: Left and right, I think, generally refer to constraints and freedom. From the predisposition of China's historical and cultural genes, China as a whole tends to lean left. Domestically, the right wing values efficiency and development, while the left wing emphasizes regulation and fairness. Currently, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and with the competition between China and the US, leaning left is certain to continue for many years.

ASSISTANT: Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches." What is considered normal public opinion? Let's randomly select three hot searches: "February 2nd, two dragons lift their heads," "Good-looking Friends Rise in Price," and "AliExpress Event." Public opinion spreads and forms a wave, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If there is a secondary wave of public opinion, there may be a small "camel peak" that reappears.

ASSISTANT: [Peak shape] refers to human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting widespread attention; [Sawtooth shape] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search rankings; [Cliff shape] refers to collective withdrawal, with the hot search fulfilling its "function" and moving on to a new task or battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of heat for one event coincides with the trough of another event, with only a few seconds difference, indicating that the unified red army has been assigned a new task and launched a new round of attacks. The professionalism of the black publicity is evident: for dozens of hot searches simultaneously ranking on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke public opinion, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgement, which ones stimulate emotions, and which ones influence decision-making. The black publicity accounts are divided into batches and targeted at different nodes, almost considering all factors in the spread of public opinion.

ASSISTANT: These three people are all students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. Since they all had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization, the government has stepped up its prevention and control measures to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain of COVID-19. From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive in Sichuan by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense after arriving at the airport.

ASSISTANT: Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration Address: Huan Cheng Nan Lu 156 Hao Xing Fu Family Garden 12th Floor Initially, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. At the beginning, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.

来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: As soon as I arrived at the store, a series of scams began. I was there for the first time just to show them my house plan, but they didn't even go to the site to measure the house. They could actually give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan, and they didn't even know what brand of materials they were using. Their second scam was that you would have to pay the deposit as soon as you got to the store (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three were the basic fees.

ASSISTANT: Regardless of how it ends up, it's the customer's problem and they are completely blameless. There are various ways to shift responsibility, and there are many details that I don't want to go into, it's all too sad. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they did the decoration for also had poor quality, and they ended up charging various fees later on. It's a scam, they are just the head of the dragon decoration that originally deceived people, now they've changed their name and become something else.
