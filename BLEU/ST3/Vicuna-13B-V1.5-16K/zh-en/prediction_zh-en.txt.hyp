I bought it, but I wrote the wrong address. Can I change it or cancel the order?
Alright, sorry.
A meaningful certificate - the emergency rescue certificate is one of the important skill certificates besides the driver's license that I think is valuable! Spread the word: emergency measures are actually for emergency rescue in case of sudden events, that is, pre-rescue before the ambulance arrives.
As we all know, after an accident, the process of an ambulance arriving takes some time, and it is precisely during this time that it is the most critical. This is the time when we need emergency treatment. If I were to really experience a heart attack, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So having someone nearby who knows first aid is really important! When someone nearby collapses, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of just standing there helplessly, unable to do anything. The feeling of helplessness is too scary. "In China, we have official data showing that there are 300,000 accidental deaths each year, and the most dangerous is cardiac arrest."
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15%. In Las Vegas casino hotels, the survival rate is 78%, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%. This is what the founder of the first response company said.
If someone experiences cardiac arrest with no breathing and no pulse, CPR is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to potentially save the person's life. I have found that we currently have very few people who are aware of the importance of learning first aid, but when an emergency arises, it is too late. Therefore, I call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
You never know, it might save someone's life! You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are even discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of my goal to complete before turning 25. Adding first aid certification to my goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certificate, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

Chongqing has launched a pilot program for modern apprenticeships in vocational schools. Starting this year, 60 vocational schools in the city will try out the new model of talent cultivation, in which students who are admitted to the schools will also have the status of trainees in enterprises. After being recruited and registered, the trainees will be pre-employed by the designated enterprises. The Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures of vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the double identity of students as both vocational school students and trainee employees be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual choice, tripartite agreements will be signed between the trainees, schools, and enterprises. For trainees who are over 16 but under 18 years old, agreements must be signed by the trainees, their guardians, schools, and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of the parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the on-the-job training of the trainees.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship formats and jointly conduct pre-job and transfer-job training for enterprise employees with collaborating enterprises. Pilot schools should reform the talent cultivation mode. The school and enterprises jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
As a pilot period for the vocational education system, the internship time for students is determined according to the talent cultivation plan for professionals in enterprises, and the peak internship generally lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented, and according to the different characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each rotation of the post. According to the arrangement, from August 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 municipal-level intermediate vocational student pilot sites in three batches, with a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices).
According to the principle of pilot first and then roll out, gradually expanding from the point to the surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise cooperative recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation, effectively improving students' on-the-job skills and increasing their employment rate and quality.
"My app shows as delivered, but I haven't received it yet."
Just now, I ordered some takeout and I don't know if it's been hung on the door handle and called for a re-delivery.
I live in Shek Wu Hui, why would the delivery address be wrong to He Hui Flower Garden?
I have considered this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally took the plunge. The suction power is not bad, and there is less dust in the house. However, holding it with one hand feels a bit heavy, and the wet mop needs improvement as it leaves residue when removing it. Overall, I am satisfied with this product. It is suitable for small kitchens like mine, and my children say the food I cook tastes better than what I make. I have made both stir-fried and boiled dishes, and the sugar-vinegar pork ribs are particularly delicious. The cooking time is longer, but other dishes only take a short time. The noise level is low, and I don't have to worry about burning the food or not being able to cook it. As soon as I received the product, I couldn't wait to cook three dishes for lunch. This is truly how technology improves life. The control of temperature and seasoning is precise, and the taste of the food is directly upgraded to a chef's level. It is a great tool for those who are not skilled in cooking, and I recommend purchasing it!
I have added a new member to my kitchen. An intelligent cooking machine that automatically controls the heat and flips the food by itself. I no longer have to fear being scalded by hot oil or ruining the food by not controlling the heat properly.
The stir-fried dishes are more delicious than the ones I made, the stir-fried eggs with tomatoes are particularly flavorful, and the eggs have a great texture. This pan is a good value. The ingredients are great and worth purchasing, very good.
Overall, it is very good, very clear, and consistent with the description. It is worth owning. The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and not tiring on the eyes. So far, I haven't noticed any other abnormalities compared to mainstream displays, but it is thicker and the frame is wider. The gap between the frame and the screen is a bit larger, but the screen display effect is not bad, and the accessories are complete and the speed is fast!
The merchant's service attitude is good! I used it for a while, the quality is not bad, and the screen resolution is also very clear. The stock trading is great, only 1 yuan per share, it's perfect!
The logistics are fast, the goods are good, the second item I bought is indeed good stuff. The display screen has high quality, not distorted due to the large screen, the interfaces are complete. The overall feeling is good, the colors are well restored, and the quality is excellent!

South African doctors: Omicron's transmission power is strong, but most cases are mild  Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province said that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The CEO of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to develop severe illness from COVID-19.
He said that compared to the previous Delta wave of COVID-19, the patients he treated had "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels." Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the observations of doctors and early evidence have provided some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% had severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among the recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate among the early outbreak cases in South Africa reached 20%. The director of the African Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all the signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "Currently, we still need to obtain data from the later stage. Usually, the time of hospitalization and death occurs later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delta still being one of the major COVID-19 strains worldwide, the Omicron variant is now appearing in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. Health officials have reported that in the first week of December, the number of new cases in Gauteng province increased by 400%, and test results show that over 90% of the Omicron variant cases have been detected.

I hope you understand.
Because the delivery time is faster than the displayed 30 minutes, thank you.
Yes, I've changed drivers and he's been waiting for a long time. That restaurant has been saying they're processing it for a while now.
I've been waiting for a few hours.
The photo has been taken and uploaded to you.
I know, but the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
It turns out I didn't call #NUMBER# after all.
If you don't send it, I will definitely complain. Why didn't you tell me earlier?
How long have you been waiting?
No, I didn't receive the call. Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any longer.
I have been waiting for an order for an hour and a half, but it has not been delivered. I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the restaurant sent live chicken soup.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to practice with a racket that's not too expensive first. Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't distinguish between them, it's normal for expensive rackets to be more friendly than cheap ones. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have very low intensity, when the ball hits the racket head, it vibrates a lot, and the hard racket can't hold up. Even professionals have a hard time controlling them.
The logic and underlying message are - tennis is so difficult, you can't learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so I'll cheat you with cheap ones. You'll play twice and never play again. That way, this racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad. When you can really distinguish good from bad, it means you've progressed, and then you can come back and buy the expensive ones from me. I'll make twice the money. I suggest spending a similar price to buy a second-hand good racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets can't be sold at high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 is already good, and a second-hand one for 200, isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a thousand-dollar racket?
The text translates to:  Friendly to newbies, but once you pass the newbie stage, it's all downhill from there. But most people, especially women, can't get past the newbie stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times regarding the delivery time, may I ask for your assistance in following up on this matter? Delayed.
"谢谢" means "thank you" in English.
It means that, in fact, I already have credit?
Next, do I need to place another order? Was the previous order no longer necessary?

Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural elementary school physical education teachers in the next three years-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Nanchang May 22nd (Reporter Chen Yuxuan) According to a report from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, in order to strengthen the shortage of subject teachers and ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, since 2016, Jiangxi Province has planned to train 10,000 qualified music, art, and physical education teachers for primary schools in the entire province within three years. It is understood that the target of this training is for primary school teachers in rural areas of Jiangxi Province who are under 45 years old and have a basic knowledge or talent in music, art, and physical education. They can also serve as teachers of other subjects in addition to music, art, and physical education courses.
Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of aesthetics education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, grasp modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of versatile aesthetics educators to alleviate the problem of shortage of aesthetics educators in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to train 100 primary school music, art, and physical education teachers in each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, a total of 3,000 trainees, comprehensively improving their teaching demonstration and leadership ability, teaching research activity design organization ability, training ability, and network training workshop construction ability, playing a teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising role.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous wrong order, but my car wheel cake is missing.
Hello, when will the ordered meal be delivered?
"Your ride-hailing driver's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#. Could you please provide a reasonable explanation?"
Sure, but your driver has some issues. Please handle it well.
Can you check if it's still on the way? If it can be delivered, that's fine. If it's really not, then refund the order payment.
In fact, there is a lot of emphasis on clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls with heavier bodies, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, which can cover the fleshy part of the thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the excess flesh on the thighs.
Wearing clothes that are too long can give people a feeling of being short and fat. If you cut out the top, middle, and bottom sections in different colors, it will appear that you have naturally grown taller. For example, using a different color for the upper body, skirt, and long socks can create a sense of being tall. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide excess weight. A noble and elegant black mini skirt is also a favorite choice for chubby girls.
Wearing clothes in dark colors, especially black short skirts, can make you look slimmer. If you have fat legs, don't make your socks and shoes too noticeable. The more popular it is, the better. The color should not be too eye-catching either.
In order to avoid people noticing your legs and feet, it's important to give off a feeling of being overweight. For slightly overweight girls, there are some tricks to dressing that are worth sharing. Don't wear tight-fitting short skirts, and avoid tops that are too short or stuffed into your skirt, as this can make you look uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black opaque tights or grid tights (the kind with finer grids). Choose A-line skirts with floral prints, and pair them with a blouse with a ruffled collar. This can effectively hide the shortcomings of an overweight girl.
Of course, even the chubby girl can be particular about her outfit when wearing a short skirt. When a chubby girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make her figure look taller. Paired with high heels, it can make your legs look longer, which is the IN thing of the summer!
If you are a bit heavier on top but have slim legs, I recommend choosing a fancy short dress. Not only can it cover your belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. An A-line dress will look slimming, which is more suitable for chubby girls. For the top, choose something that fits a bit tighter to create a sense of layering, which will make you look even slimmer.
Keep it simple with a white T-shirt and a mini skirt. Even chubby MMs can try it. Girls with a slim figure can also exude fashion sense. As long as you master the rules of dressing and matching, plump girls can also become the focus of everyone's attention.
After the change in dressing style, it's also important to exercise more in daily life and strive to break free from the label of "skinny girl" early in the morning. 😄

Most 3A games are also playable.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is not bad, the fan is quite powerful, and the work is relatively quiet. The game effect is also quite good when the fan is set to full speed. The appearance is quite cool, and the display effect of the game itself is quite clear. The screen is quite clear, and playing games in 1080p is enough for a laptop user to think it's pretty good. It's mainly used for design work, and the cost-performance ratio is quite high. It's lighter and better-looking than imagined, and the red on the butt is a very nice color of wine, not as vulgar as imagined. Overall, it's much better than expected, and it's worth buying. It's also suitable for women.
Two years ago, I started using the MSI Gaming Laptop and have been using it for two years now. The cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the quality is quite sturdy! My friends around me also recommend them to purchase this product! Currently, I have purchased three models in this series of laptops!
The appearance is beautiful and good-looking, and the configuration is also very suitable for my nephew to buy. I originally planned to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he needed it urgently, so I had to buy it earlier. As a result, I missed the bank's big activity, which is a bit regretful. However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics is also quite fast. I will come back later to update the review.
A brand new game notebook with high cost-performance, designed in a very good style, has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019, and the 3D rendering effect is displayed: bought it for my child to use for 3D rendering, the software is already installed, and my child said it can be used without any problems. This notebook is very suitable for 3D design work. I bought it for my son, and he said it was very good.
The computer is pretty good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, they are patient with those who don't understand and are willing to help. It's recommended to purchase, and the graphics for playing games are quite good.
"Why are there 6 copies of a shrimp dumpling order when there is only one order?"
I won't go, I ordered something online 1 hour ago and no one has contacted me yet, this is definitely an online scam.
You think this is my first time ordering takeout? After investigating, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order, and it was delivered successfully, thank you! How many days ago was that?
From 7:00 to now 9:30, it hasn't been delivered yet. It's necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Claimed to have the loudest exhaust note in the New Mountain District! This time, our team brings you a dream car for many men! It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini - the Aventador LP700-4, the successor to the Murcielago.
The price of this car is close to two million yuan, and the annual road tax is several thousand yuan. It has four wheels and is called LP700 because it has 700 horsepower. Can you imagine how fast it is? Even the editor doesn't know the exact figure, but according to the data, it can accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in just 2.9 seconds. By the time the editor's Myvi reaches 30km/h, the LP700 is already traveling at 100km/h!
The low car body, aggressive scissor doors, large air intakes on all sides of the body, and the 6.5 v12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini. There is no need to say too much about the car model, you can Google it yourself. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be given by Google! Too much attention, where everyone is looking, makes me uncomfortable (but it's actually kind of cool).
1km油钱在RM1左右 (车主根本不care)上下车的姿势要练习一下，不然会有点尴尬 (因为会爬不出车舱然后卡住一半)引擎声太大，下车后会顿时耳聋。(不过还是很爽)
The car body is too big, it will be quite narrow when parked in a regular parking space, and I'm afraid it will be hit by the car next to me when they open their door! A bit lonely on the road, because there's no opponent (I'm talking about myself, not the car owner, haha) Guys, don't misunderstand, I'm not selling this video, sorry!
If you have friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars, please feel free to contact us! More car information that you may not know is available on The Car Guide / People's Car Encyclopedia, which is worth millions in car accidents!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are cars that many car enthusiasts are familiar with. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of a Porsche 911 is also in the six-figure range! Recently, someone in a foreign country crashed both a Porsche 911 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and a Bugatti Chiron worth millions of dollars in just a few minutes! The result proves that expensive things are worth it!
I ordered a meal deal, but two items were delivered incorrectly.

The whole visual wedding photography base (Hebei store) does not currently have branch wedding fashion avant-garde, makeup artists are also top-notch, shooting techniques and angles are professional, shooting effects are very good. The seller has a very good reputation and the service attitude is also very good.
The makeup is very exquisite, and the team service is also very good. I had a great time on this trip and felt very professional. The seller's service attitude was very good, and I will introduce it to my friends. I am very satisfied. Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist for allowing me to have unique wedding dress photos. Thank you to all the staff who helped with the photos today, and I look forward to seeing the finished product.
Taking wedding photos is really a physically demanding task, especially for the photographer who has to run and jump around. The makeup artist was very thoughtful and designed a makeup look that suited my face shape. During the photo shoot, the photographer's humorous and playful style was praiseworthy. I am grateful to my photographer and makeup artist, and I hope to look this beautiful for the rest of my life.
Praise the bride, she has beautiful eyes and a nice figure, and she looks like a virtuous wife and a good mother at first glance. She will be thrifty and hardworking in managing the household in the future. The groom must have done well financially, and they will live a happy and blessed life together.

The wedding dress photos are so beautiful, blowing up the photographer and makeup artist, you are really super super professional.
Thank you Sister Mu for your patient companionship and thoughtful guidance. I really like the photos you took~ When I saw the wedding dress photos, I suddenly didn't recognize myself. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have wedding photos that can rival those of celebrities.
The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and makeup artist have aesthetics in common, fortunately, I found one. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "cheated" by the photos.
More than 130 Asian American organizations in the US submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, accusing three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - of discriminating against Asian American applicants in their admission process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. - Xu Jianmei, Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23rd.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of top American universities has increased many times over, but the proportion of Asians in these three top American universities has remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and persistently discriminated against Asian applicants in their so-called "holistic" admission process. Zhao Yu Kong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asians was the lowest compared to the number of applicants of all ethnicities.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in recruitment. They also hope that the universities being sued will take the issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.
Currently, the three colleges that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's appeal also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.
Why is the order still being executed even though the cutlery was just canceled?
Can you check if it has been canceled?
But I had already placed my order at 5:09 this morning.
On the other side is the reservation hotline, they don't know what to say. Can you contact them directly with a phone call?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yuejia Town, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and signed a "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Agreement." The agreement stipulated that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit of 200,000 yuan would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week.
However, after that, both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory's sale and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the house purchase contract. Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the content of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. Mr. Lu had prepared for the house purchase, including the deposit and the down payment, but the seller did not sign the contract, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yuyang Municipal People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double compensation for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Circuit Court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] In the transaction process, it is necessary to exercise due diligence. As the buyer, you should exercise due diligence in verifying information such as the ownership of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information when signing the contract. It is also necessary to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm afraid he might send the wrong address.
Rì Chāng Cān Guǎn (Wǔ Dào Kǒu Shop)[Máo Huā] Surroundings: Middle-sized and Middle-grade [Service Bell] Service: Food comes up quickly "Ancient Method Malva Pudding" is my must-order dish, the Malva pudding is too fragrant, too soft, and too delicious to eat 😋 If you like desserts, you must try "Eastern Jiang Mandarin Fish Slippery Tofu Pot", the soup is very fresh, the tofu is very tender, the taste of the black bean is praiseworthy, and the meat is good. The service is warm and passionate.
It's been a long time since I've been to Daychang. The fruit tea is still so delicious and made with real ingredients, and the first time I tried the sticky rice rolls, I loved the soft and southern taste! The rice was cooked to the perfect consistency and the portion size was very generous. The signature silk paper chicken was as good as ever, and the soup was also quite tasty. The chrysanthemum flavor was particularly praiseworthy, and the service was warm and friendly. The meat dishes were also very good.
The old store of Rizhao has been a web celebrity for many years, located in a traditional courtyard building with wooden floors. You had to wait a long time to get a bowl of clay pot rice at the door, and the clay pot was cracked... I haven't gone to Rizhao to eat for several years, as the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat when you arrive at the restaurant, but the food quality is as good as ever. The taste is praiseworthy, especially the meat dishes and the main courses from Daychang takeout.
[Rice] Meal: The dish was a bit disappointing this time. Three cups of chicken: The side dishes were a bit too much, and the chicken was a bit less. The main flavor was a bit off, the saltiness was not strong enough, which highlighted the sweetness, and everyone can add sweetness and various spices to the side dishes...
What is the way to drink Johnnie Walker Red Label? Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like to collect, some people like to enjoy food, of course, there are also people who like to appreciate wine. Johnnie Walker Red Label is currently one of the best-selling Scotch whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirits Competition. Each bottle of Johnnie Walker Red Label has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't you be wasting its aroma and taste?
How to drink Red Label Whisky? Here's a simple introduction from the author:  To enjoy Red Label Whisky, start by pouring a shot of the whisky into a glass. You can add a few ice cubes to cool it down if you prefer. Then, swirl the whisky gently in the glass to release its aroma. Take a small sip and savor the taste. You can also add a splash of water or a dash of mixer like soda or ginger ale to enhance the flavor. Remember to drink responsibly and in moderation.
Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch Whisky is made from a blend of about 35 Scottish whiskies, with a rich and traditional flavor of Scottish whisky, characterized by a rich and fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. On the palate, it is rich and refreshing with a hint of mint and a strong smoky malt flavor. This whisky can be enjoyed straight over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Johnnie Walker whisky has entered the Chinese market, and to cater to the tastes of the Chinese people, Johnnie Walker whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other fizzy drinks have become a timeless fashion. These sweet drinks not only neutralize the sourness, but also visually bring pleasure to people, and when added to the drink, they have the effect of changing the taste of the whisky. The most authentic and traditional way to drink Johnnie Walker whisky is with slices of orange and sugar (sand sugar is also possible).
The authentic red label whiskey has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize its acidity, and lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the drink. Of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. The three methods mentioned above are the best ways to enjoy red label whiskey, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.

Madam Jin's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) has not yet opened a branch for shooting before the wedding. We had to change the shooting time twice because we could not arrange the time well. The consultant, Lanlan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time. Later, we chose to shoot on a sunny weekend.
The staff at Madame Jin's workplace, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised. That was my first formal makeup job, wow~ I can't believe it, I will become that beautiful one day, hahaha. Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) were very patient with the makeup and the makeup looked very natural.
The outdoor photos were taken in Jiangwan City, fortunately the weather was very good and we didn't feel too cold during the photo shoot. The makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothing and accessories, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right. The photographer was also very funny and we felt happy all day during the photo shoot. When it came to choosing the photos, we saw many examples online and didn't want to delete too many photos for the clients, but when we were choosing the photos, we didn't have any intention of adding any, we just chose the 24 photos that came with the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister, who took her wedding photos at the same place, had a package of over 7,000 yuan and added over 1,000 photos, at that time I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many).
The photos have been fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. After looking at two of them, I thought they weren't quite good enough, and they immediately helped me redo them. I took out the photos of my sister that were taken before and compared them to ours. I think we are really satisfied with our photos, they are simple, clean, and have the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jin Furen to take wedding dress photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan. Thank you, Madame, for your sincere wishes. May you be happy and prosperous, with a bright future ahead! How much is this set, by the way?
What conditions must be met for $32 to be used?

Your name is Zheng Ming, and this is your second week living in Japan. You are walking down the street when suddenly you notice someone following you. You become scared and start running faster and faster, until finally you take off running. The person behind you shouts, "Miss! Wait! Wait!" (Japanese dialogue throughout) You stop at the convenience store entrance.
"Miss... I am a director, I think you are very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show?" You are very suspicious and scared that this might be a scam. He gives you a business card, and you find out he is actually a director from a major Japanese entertainment company.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The fee is definitely not low." You agreed to go to the company with him after some hesitation, and he said he saw you on the street at a glance and hoped you could come and participate. Thinking that there was no loss and you could still earn money, you signed the contract.

320 newborn babies in Sabah without birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (Sabah, Malaysia, November 11, 2022) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper being exposed to light, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 babies. However, the department's director, K. Aminu, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the counterfeit-proof paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he explained in response to a report by a net media that the issue of the printing of the Sabah newspaper had persisted for 10 months. He said that the issue had arisen two months ago, and that Sarawak also faced the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from other states, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' inventory. Kirau Aminuys revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work. "The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods next Thursday and return to Sabah immediately to carry out the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two working days (December 20th) to deliver it to the applicant."
"We will inform the applicants to go to various branches to collect their call-up papers." He added, "Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 call-up papers this year so far."

The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism issued a document requiring strengthening the epidemic prevention and control of the novel coronavirus in port cities along the land border. It stipulates that persons who have recently left port cities along the land border (excluding those connected with Hong Kong and Macao) must present a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and persons traveling to port cities along the land border must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The time range for this requirement is from the announcement of the port city scope by each province, district, and municipality to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that conditionally open ports can study setting epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions. The person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Agency introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support, and the exchange between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies based on regions, a single line of epidemic prevention and control can become two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the advance of the border epidemic prevention and control, reduce the spread of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been several local clustered outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry. The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposes some problems such as insufficient and untimely epidemic monitoring and early warning in some localities, non-implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disposal of cold-chain products at all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and accurate emergency response to the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine aspects, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the weak links in port city epidemic prevention and control, to scientifically and accurately carry out epidemic prevention and control work and tighten the external prevention and control line.
The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and civilian livelihood protection work, publicize and open up civilian livelihood protection hotlines, regularly identify potential risks in the supply of basic life necessities and prices, and actively respond to and solve prominent problems reflected by the public. According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include counties (cities, districts, banners) where land, water, and air ports are located, as well as the cities (prefectures, states, leagues) and directly administered municipalities where they are situated. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Old clothes are inevitably prone to minor defects, so if you decide to purchase old-style products, you should have this in mind. If you are a perfectionist, I will point out more obvious defects.

On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the Bilibili platform sparked widespread attention. The video reveals the truth about the US military's 20-year obsession with blood and slaughter. (Video source: Bilibili)
This film tells the story of how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "fighting terrorism" and forcibly exported American-style democracy. Over the course of 20 years, the military became addicted to violence, committed numerous war crimes, and killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians. They used drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, distorted human nature, and formed killing squads. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" where "suspects" are subjected to various forms of torture and physical humiliation. One atrocity after another has sparked more hatred among the Afghan people. As the video said, the US-style "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more terrifying."
War has not brought the people of Afghanistan peace, democracy, and prosperity, but only left the country full of wounds and countless killings and destructions. Let's watch the video together to uncover the truth behind the US's so-called "anti-terrorism" actions and the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
The food arrived late, and it had all cooled down. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it, and even the soup had spilled out.
Immediately cancel, the things he sent are definitely cold, I haven't taken them yet! #NAME# said no one went to pick them up.
"If you don't refund the money after we talk on the phone, I will report you to the police."
Multiple times I have used #PRS\_ORG#, but today's experience was the worst and completely unacceptable.
However, it is also necessary to remind the restaurant and the driver to avoid a similar incident from happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time, but it keeps getting delayed and I don't know how long to wait.
If you cancel the order, can you get a refund for the payment?
How to give payment to the driver for the service fee?
An hour or more ago, it was confirmed that a driver was unwilling to wait any longer.
Don't scare people off at the starting line - When browsing bookstores, one can often sense the popularity of success-oriented books. Many of the success-oriented books that are currently popular emphasize the "best principles" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it," and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it.
Let me translate the text from Chinese to English:  Which means that we need to talk about the most important and fundamental aspect, which is "how to do it". Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are fully committed to doing their best, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either they climb Mount Tai, or they just wait in place. This "best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it is "extremely correct", but 99% of people are intimidated before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a decision to transform yourself and make a 180-degree change," which is exactly the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who are conservative, stick to the old ways, and refuse to change, you will have to shout loudly in their ears "you must transform," which is undoubtedly self-deception and beating a dead horse. Most people will be afraid to take the first step and hesitant to make a decision when faced with the word "transformation." Alternatively, they may make a hasty decision to transform and take the first step, but it often doesn't last long, and they quickly lose momentum and fall behind. It is difficult to see any sustainability in this.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue "Starting from Tomorrow" perfectly embodies the classic representation of "universal human nature." The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limit of what most people can achieve, leaving them feeling frustrated. Perhaps the "second-best principle" is a more feasible path for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core principle of "the next good thing" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100%, doing 1% is also fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand hill in front of your house is also fine, because that is also better than staying in the same place. In any case, as long as you do something, it is stronger than not doing anything. Because the threshold has been significantly lowered, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as you persevere, the probability of success will also increase.
The road to success following the "second-best principle" may be a bit longer, but it can effectively motivate more people and benefit more people. Although the "best principle" appears to be a banner for making everyone successful on the surface, in reality, it can only effectively motivate a few; while the "second-best principle" can motivate more people.
Do I need to place a new order now?
The phone has been ringing unanswered and the delivery has not been sent yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered? How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He missed two meals, but one order has already been completed. I want to ask how to contact the driver who just delivered to me and tell him that there will be another driver coming to deliver.
The resource reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake has increased by 7,100 tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results, reaching 108,500 tons, with a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the protected initial period in 2002. Naked carp, also known as "Yangtze River fish", is a rare and valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human activities such as large-scale killing and degradation of the breeding environment, the number of Tibetan antelopes in the Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the reserve of Qinghai Lake Tibetan antelopes was only 2,592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake Tibetan antelopes were listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the "Closure of Qinghai Lake for Breeding Fish", prohibiting any unit, collective or individual from catching or selling Tibetan antelopes and their products in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and releasing and cleaning the main river channels of the rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has been increasing annually. The deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of 1.8 billion naked carp have been artificially bred and released in Qinghai Lake, contributing to the recovery rate of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources exceeding 23%. The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water source nurturing area in China and even Asia, while Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone for controlling the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, and to protect the aquatic wildlife, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, even though the weather was cold.
Excuse me, is the takeout delivered in a bag? We just see a bag and want to know if it's a missed delivery or if someone has taken it, thank you.
It's been 1 hour already, but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and it's a bit disappointing to receive the wrong order. I hope the restaurant can prepare another meal for the little ones. Please check the quality of the food while being busy.
Taking a foot bath and getting an electric shock from the bubbles? Choosing the right foot bath basin can have excellent therapeutic and health effects on the feet. Today, the editor of Jumei will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, providing consumers with a wide range of choices, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan.
In related data, compared with traditional home appliances, sales of health-related home appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking.
Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet. Mr. Li tried using a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that this popular foot bath basin has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of applicable population, materials guaranteeing safety at the highest temperature setting, etc. However, generally speaking, foot bath basins do not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a modular foot bath basin.
Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard. You can test it with an electric pen at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headline - Hunan Daily - huasong.hunan.gov.cn - Hunan Daily December 10th news (full media reporters: Zhang Changwu, Hu Lanlan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Product Launch Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry. Vice Chairman of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Association and Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Huo Shunli, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in new industries, and the rise of red tea injects new impetus as "Five-color Tea of Xiang". In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a trillion-dollar Xiang tea industry, forming a development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five-color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, and main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea have taken turns to launch. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving a large increase in income for tea farmers.
The winds of fortune shift, and red tea is making a comeback. Provincial tea experts say that by harvesting green tea and black tea, tea farmers can have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens is on the rise. At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Lake Red Tea" trademark, and welcomed the launch of "Lake Red Tea's Origin".
In the New Xihu Red Tea Museum, a tea merchant from Fujian saw a high mountain tea named "Ice in Spring" and immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Fujian Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with joy that the tea market has been affected to some extent by the epidemic and other factors, but from the tea exhibition, it can be seen that there are many highlights. The New Xihu Red Tea has a touch of red, injecting the tea culture connotation, and the popularity is high, the transaction is hot. The Changsha tea industry welcomes the new spring with enthusiasm.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled? I don't want them anymore, because there's no way to stop the car below, so he couldn't deliver them.
#NUMBER# 100 yuan has been received, it's a missing food item.

There is evidence from #PRS\_ORG# to prove that no one took it, #PRS\_ORG# falsely accused me and I had to defend myself again. I sent it to the delivery person's house and you didn't take it, then falsely accused me of taking it myself.

Time Capsule Photography has not yet opened branches, and there are no member evaluations [effects] for the photos yet. Photo effects: I took two outfits. Overall, it's not bad. I like the photos in this set quite a bit.
[Service Details]: Due to discomfort during pregnancy, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and allowed me to rest for a while. They also continuously provided me with cold water to drink. Package price: 1000 yuan. Thank you to the rabbit for the review. Initially, I had planned to reject the ancient style, but the finished product was simply too beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can give us the energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend it to all of you! There is nothing to criticize, from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography to post-production.
The makeup artist is particularly skilled and will match your style to create a makeup look that suits you. All the makeup products used are from top-tier brands. As for the photography, it's quite professional. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and the popular photography studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance. Some of my colleagues have had their photos taken there, and they thought they were just so-so after seeing the finished product. I specifically sought out this studio because it is a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is the case for most people as well. The photographer brother will capture and record the natural and splendid moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a top-notch team. When the film comes out, we and the people around us all praise it endlessly. I have already recommended it to my close friends, and my close friend just watched the film and was equally delighted.
I hope this kind of studio won't be buried and more people can discover TA and show their own style instead of being uniform. Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Jinxing and Qingling, both of whom are very creative and talented newcomers. We are a creative studio, and as long as the client likes us, we will put in 200% effort to complete the project. We are grateful for the sweet and helpful assistant, the lively and cheerful photography teacher, and every member of the team. It was a wonderful experience and the results exceeded my expectations. Thank you all for your hard work! 😘😘
Thank you for your comment, Little Universe. Meeting you is also a kind of fate. From Urumqi to Qinhuangdao, our trust is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao to play again.
How should I give the money? The resent meal has already been sent.
The driver did not receive the phone call from the restaurant staff right now.
A programming newbie who wants to share their personal experience. If you're planning to enter this industry, you can consider finding a place to receive training, but if you don't have that idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the money spent on training is very expensive, and it takes six months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. Training is an even better choice for them.
If you have a strong self-study ability, you can also choose to learn on your own, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the institution's faculty strength. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the institution has no meaning. Of course, the faculty strength of some newly opened training institutions may not be very strong.
Secondly, before making a decision, it's a good idea to investigate this training institution. It's best to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution, because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the courses are. I don't know how to answer your question, to be honest, because you haven't introduced your own situation. Learning this stuff is closely related to your personal circumstances, such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you're in. These factors will all be related to the industry you want to work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many training institutions both offline and online, but the cost of learning is high and the time investment is quite large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. However, if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili to find training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultations. In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining videos.
If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of study fees and time costs, it is recommended that you go to a training institution to learn. This way of learning does not have to be very tiring, and the teachers will explain in detail. If you have any questions, there will be people dedicated to answering them, and in terms of study planning or supervision, there will also be assistance. Moreover, nowadays many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after studying, so you can save a lot of trouble in the interview process for finding a job later on. The above are my views on this matter. Since I don't know your specific situation, I only gave a general introduction, and if you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for communication and discussion.
I arrived at 1 point before. I saw it in the app.
What do you mean, you haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I, undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stovetops, oil fumes, lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional sewing, home service. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is hard, but we must continue to live and not betray every effort. If you like, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only see the results, but we have to endure the process alone. When facing life, besides being strong, we have no other choice but to continue. The road may be able to turn back and look, but it cannot turn back and walk... Cleaning is both work and responsibility. Life becomes beautiful because of service, and service becomes exquisite because of sincerity. Although we may do the dirtiest job, we will use the most serious attitude to clean every corner of the customer's home until it is spotless. When we see the satisfied smile and the raised thumb of the customer, at that moment, all the hard work is worth it, and the investment will eventually pay off!
My daily work - your requirements, my service. Heartfelt service, heartfelt cleaning, preserve the beauty.
The details you care about, Feng Jia's housekeeping can make it "clean" to the best of my ability, serving with love. Protecting every family's cleanliness, planting the banner of housekeeping, serving to perfection, and cleaning to the home. Both indoor and outdoor cleaning are part of my daily work.
The crystal lamp is magnificent, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly, just like in life, if we put in the effort and pay attention to the details, we can achieve success. We strive for excellence in every aspect of our work, and your satisfaction is our top priority. The quality speaks for itself, as professionalism is worth trusting, and your recognition is what motivates us the most.
The current situation in every industry is tough! But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, persevere, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least I will be stronger than those who just sit and complain. "A day's plan starts in the morning, and all the beauty begins with the dawn." I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction as you start a new day and maintain a good mood all day. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed when we had it. As we grew up, happiness became a goal to be achieved. But as we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and once we understood that, we were happy. Being the truest, kindest version of ourselves, following our heart, and living a life without regrets; walking our own path in life; these are the two greatest treasures in life: good health and a good mood, living happily and contentedly until old age! In every stage of life, we will encounter different difficulties.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but your courage to face things positively. Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it head-on. The more you're afraid, the more you'll be defeated by difficulties; but if you face challenges head-on, you'll eventually overcome them.
The curator of the China Sand Museum collaborated with the Saudi Arabian government to hold the first Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua Net, December 12 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Jun) The first Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the biennale. The biennale was co-curated by the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Yan Xiaoyu, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Touching Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and also reflects the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The biennale covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings displaying works in six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, with some artists using innovative ways to create with recycled materials, such as Ice using discarded materials to reconstruct a classic landscape painting in his "Behind the Story Series: Endless Mountains and Rivers" (2014).
Diriyah Biennale Foundation CEO Bakri said he hoped this year's biennale could establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural and creative industries and creative communities, and enhancing interaction. Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is double, on the one hand, it allows contemporary Saudi art to participate in the global dialogue, on the other hand, it allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, in which artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered an axe and a cleaver from the restaurant, and they told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver bones. I want to ask for clarification on the reason.
"Bones can, call the restaurant to arrange delivery separately."
However, the system is not very convenient, it is still using another room.
I am at #ADDRESS#, in the Mei Xin Li branch which is quite far away from me.

Yunnan: Regulate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bi Feng) To continue to do a good job in helping poverty-stricken populations find employment and to consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the revitalization of rural areas and the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. According to relevant personnel of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Human and Social Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welf01
This regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, the National Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and four other departments. It mainly standardizes the object of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, position development, position management, and other aspects. In terms of position development, the regulation clearly stipulates that positions should be developed according to the principle of "needs-based, position-based, dynamic management, and total quantity control" and the principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary public announcement, and unified management." The recruitment process must follow the steps of public announcement, application, review, public notice, employment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the relevant departments to supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions. The regulations also stipulate that the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for the personnel in rural public welfare positions, and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.
The address is wrong, can you cancel the order?
"Have I canceled the order by reordering?"
Although the rightists had a period of triumph in history, it was not long-lasting. They flourished when they received a little sunshine and sweated when they drank a little water. As soon as they achieved their goals, they would be attached to the leftists. However, when it comes to seeking the truth, the rightists played a positive role in the social progress. From defining the truth standard to developing the economy, promoting technological advancement, and promoting the institutionalization and protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
Three, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I'm very interested in what he has to say, and I also respect him as a person. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes a serious look at China's social issues. But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, chaos in political groups, and finally, foreign powers taking advantage of the situation.  Four, to change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who attempt political speculation and try to take advantage of the situation are not right-wingers, they are just a bunch of idiots.
Let's talk about this again. The left, in fact, is a group of orphans of the times and politics. If it can be said that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their ideas when necessary. But the left doesn't have this kind of thinking, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I have seen some friends who are both against traitors and against leftists, and they are still very passionate about it. I think it's not necessary. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both one-dimensional, and there's no point in reasoning with them. Also, don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making traitors and leftists acknowledge it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the counter-revolutionaries curse you for five mao and the leftists curse you as a rightist dog, it just proves that our middle way is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but later forgot them or pursued them to the point of becoming dogmatic. Some even started out as heroic young dragon-slayers, but ended up as evil dragons.
Left and right, I think, generally refer to constraints and freedom. From the predisposition of China's historical and cultural genes, China as a whole tends to lean left. Domestically, the right wing values efficiency and development, while the left wing emphasizes regulation and fairness. Currently, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and with the competition between China and the US, leaning left is certain to continue for many years.
Although I can't understand it, I'll just give it a thumbs up since it's such a chivalrous act.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches." What is considered normal public opinion? Let's randomly select three hot searches: "February 2nd, two dragons lift their heads," "Good-looking Friends Rise in Price," and "AliExpress Event." Public opinion spreads and forms a wave, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If there is a secondary wave of public opinion, there may be a small "camel peak" that reappears.
They look exactly the same as the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? By randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, it presents the characteristics of "peak shape", "sawtooth shape", and "cliff shape".
[Peak shape] refers to human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting widespread attention; [Sawtooth shape] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search rankings; [Cliff shape] refers to collective withdrawal, with the hot search fulfilling its "function" and moving on to a new task or battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of heat for one event coincides with the trough of another event, with only a few seconds difference, indicating that the unified red army has been assigned a new task and launched a new round of attacks. The professionalism of the black publicity is evident: for dozens of hot searches simultaneously ranking on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke public opinion, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgement, which ones stimulate emotions, and which ones influence decision-making. The black publicity accounts are divided into batches and targeted at different nodes, almost considering all factors in the spread of public opinion.
Propagation is a science, putting aside personal stances and emotions, public relations will also disappear without a trace when faced with objective data. Every action leaves a trace, and we will uncover these traces together. Data source: Time Machine Hot Search.
Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency's correspondents abroad, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus. Mauritius reported its first two cases of infection with the Omicron strain on December 10th.
According to the Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th. The other infected individual is a local resident of Mauritius who came into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned. The two infected individuals were treated in hospital and their nucleic acid test results have turned negative. They have now returned to their respective homes. Cyprus announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
These three people are all students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. Since they all had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization, the government has stepped up its prevention and control measures to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain of COVID-19. From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers over the age of 12 who arrive in Sichuan by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense after arriving at the airport.
The Saudi Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. Malawi's Minister of Health, Khumbize Kandodo Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had detected its first three cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The country's health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these three cases of infection.
The phone number provided by the delivery rider for the takeout order was fake.
"Will I get a refund if I reorder the same item?"
If it can't be done, please cancel the order and get a refund.
Thinking of calling for breakfast early and eating early, but now it's 7 o'clock and I haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you're saying... is your Chinese translated or do you prefer to use English?
Should I call him to deliver that message?

I don't think this will be of any help!
The order for the money belly is from Phoenix Claws, and the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do you want me to stay in the conversation?
I explained to your staff on the phone.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration Address: Huan Cheng Nan Lu 156 Hao Xing Fu Family Garden 12th Floor Initially, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look. At the beginning, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.
As soon as I arrived at the store, a series of scams began. I was there for the first time just to show them my house plan, but they didn't even go to the site to measure the house. They could actually give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan, and they didn't even know what brand of materials they were using. Their second scam was that you would have to pay the deposit as soon as you got to the store (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of more than 10,000 yuan. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets in the bathroom, and these three were the basic fees.
Excluding their service fees, which are higher than those of other companies, I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced and had a dedicated team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it ends up, it's the customer's problem and they are completely blameless. There are various ways to shift responsibility, and there are many details that I don't want to go into, it's all too sad. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they did the decoration for also had poor quality, and they ended up charging various fees later on. It's a scam, they are just the head of the dragon decoration that originally deceived people, now they've changed their name and become something else.
So don't choose such incompetent decoration companies. In the future, when choosing, please check these and inquire about them on Baidu because decoration is not cheap. If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of merchant reviews, please see the merchant's statement for details. The Chongqing Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours. Find a decoration company by browsing the public reviews on the platform.
So terrifying, if it takes less than 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my refund within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it could be canceled within 15 minutes.
"Kǒu shuǐ jī yīng xū de, dàn shōu huò de shēng ròu, méi bǎng fāng chī"  This should be translated as: "The mouth-watering chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it."
I haven't received a response for 3 days. Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly subscription plan! What's even stranger is that I use the same credit card every time, but I still have to pay shipping fees every time.
Can you first grant an exemption, and then collect my monthly fee after your investigation is complete? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's almost 3 o'clock now, isn't it time for you to give me compensation and come to deliver the goods?
But the driver just put it by the door and then the person left and it was delivered to the wrong address.
Your driver has already picked up an order for me at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me to wait for the driver, who received my order at 19:25, but still refuses to take me to complete the purchase. Do I need to order something else?
How to handle when your driver has gone and you still have to wait?
I will send the package, if you don't cancel, I will report to the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such behavior of personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scoundrel. If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing we need to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending friend requests on Facebook and posting provocative posts, to your attempt to publish what you call my hometown and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude. After you, you intensified your tagging of me, not only maintaining a frequency of one day six meals, but also continuing to discuss ambiguous, humiliating comments about me on Facebook with you and your so-called friends, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and what kind of fruit to plant in bed, etc. I...I've had enough. But later, I received even more friend requests from Facebook friends sending me a photo of you and comments with sexual harassment content.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my reporting was uploaded, you did not show any restraint, but instead became more and more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your identity and status in society. In our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment. You can even deny that it's not your photo or continue to post attacking comments. That's right, I can't and don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and don't want to know you, and my appearance and figure don't need your comments.
I don't even think any girl would be willing to let others humiliate her like this for the sake of fame. My friend asked me if I was okay, and I said I was, but you wouldn't believe it.
I think it's impossible for any girl to say she's okay after being bullied like this. Whether it's in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even the most basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice resides in the hearts of people.
I captured some comments for everyone to review. You should not be able to impersonate yourself with this post, right? I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.
"会心一笑" can be translated to "a smile from the heart" or "a heartfelt smile" in English.
I have reported and attached a photo, but have not received a response.
What kind of cow? If there's no cow, there's no beef broth, and there's no way to eat fresh meat.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?
"Unacceptable, I've already placed the order and it's supposed to be delivered at 7am."
Why is the remake so different?
