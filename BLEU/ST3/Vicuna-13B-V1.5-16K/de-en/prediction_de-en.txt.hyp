The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the item's value... I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer, so it's not a problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so it can be tracked as a return from you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I have to be honest, I find that quite frustrating.
Do I have to cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get a discount?
I personally also think that children should not be required to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I believe it is beneficial for older siblings to help out with their younger siblings to some extent. For example, watching them for a short time, helping them out occasionally, or bringing them a bottle.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are integrated. As long as they can still be a child themselves, I don't see a problem there. If your K1 takes care of the short time alone and it's okay for them, that's good.
You can best decide for yourself whether this is suitable for your children. It's not like he has to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours when he falls asleep. Legally, it's probably questionable.
Maybe that's why the psychologist's statement comes into play. Because if something actually happens like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you want to take, of course, is up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again! I read a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title for the life of me. Maybe someone here knows something about it... The story was about fear and how to cope with it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with feed and entering his enclosure with predators. The case is taken over by a commissioner who quickly leads to his therapist who runs a clinic for treating fear patients. The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist.
There are more cases of self-murder and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of each self-murder and document it, and post the photos on the internet. Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patients' brains that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients are ultimately forced to face their anxiety in the most extreme way (a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death).
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight". At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had something to do with fire. This is roughly the plot, I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If someone knows about this action or can even reveal the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available. I need to contact my husband first. But that may take some time.
What steps do I need to take?
Is it also possible to get a refund of the price difference?
Child, 4 years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) over the entire length. Tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp. Did not work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left. Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 scales. LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker with a sound diaphragm kit.
Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder. It masters the data format DCC as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In DCC format, 14 to 128 speed levels are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thank RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with a suitable digital central station. It controls all DCC programming modes, and with compatible central stations, CV values on the main track can be read out. For central stations that can only program CV values from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels with 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also allows for reprogramming with the prestigious Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central stations. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system. Braking with DCC braking blocks or with direct current is also possible.
In addition, he also holds a Selectrix® braking diode. An ABC-pendulum train automatic allows for automatic pendulum movement between two stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on both analog AC and DC railways.
After my voucher was not extended due to a complaint that did not arrive, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere, where customer friendliness is prioritized and I don't have to tip-toe around to achieve nothing at all! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson will accelerate the booster vaccination campaign New Omikron cases provide politics and science in Great Britain. Therefore, all eligible adults in England should receive a vaccination offer by the end of the year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to accelerate the COVID-19 booster vaccinations at an even faster pace than previously targeted due to rapidly increasing Omikron cases. Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second dose, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening. Previously, the target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing a crisis situation with the Omikron variant, which is why the vaccine protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson. The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose.
"Get boosted now!" said Johnson. On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137. This represents an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent a job application. Today, I received an invitation for an interview via email.
I will respond to the email. Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now. Can someone please help me? I am a foreigner and don't want to step on any officials' toes.
Conclusion: everyone should become familiar with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. Four of them work. Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale. How could such a foam damage occur otherwise after 9 months?
Try it first on the #PRS\_ORG#. But that has been working for about 14 days no longer.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were none left. Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and have it charged to my account.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content Warning: I'm going to write a bit more in-depth about domestic violence here. I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) frequently come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons. A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs all too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them. I am clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I can't reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, is very close to tears, are all worth being able to live without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't. It will never be easier that way, but please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring production: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently started on Netflix. Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim. At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, held up. Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, had said with regard to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs." However, this did not subside after the game, but rather increased in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Although the bare result was disappointing, what was even more disheartening was the manner and style of the team's performance.
A substitute statistic expresses the whole dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was only 13 percent, 4 shots (all from young John Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions? John Patrick answered: "We were not concentrated enough after the win in Tenerife and did not implement what we trained for, namely moving the ball."
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted very differently: "It was awesome to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people." Although only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, they made the most of it.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. "The best playmaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim again. While in Patrick's team, even the key performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) underperformed.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a complete rout and came within eight points after they had already trailed 39:59. Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points. Fortunately, there was not much time for complaining.
Already on Wednesday (at 8 pm) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself several months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again for this reason.
We had originally registered ourselves half a year ago.
Always peeled like an egg: Max Raabe will be 59 years old and manages to captivate his audience with new interpretations of 1920s and 1930s hit songs. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck".
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. But that's not going to happen. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other planned appearances during the Advent season must also fall through, as it says on the website of the singer, who is celebrating his 59th birthday today, and his musicians (<http://www.palast-orchester.de>). From January, the artists then want to catch up on their already postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic. Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing. In 1986, he founded the Palace Orchestra together with fellow students. Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlagers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women, That's No Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream. Always impeccably dressed, with his blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good day, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance? It can be combined with existing furniture and we could check in advance whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only fold the cover but not flip through the pages.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: The expropriation does not create any new apartments. The new Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment conglomerates, as has been demanded in a Berlin popular vote. "With an expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the structure of ownership," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years. By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is actually the best protection against the formation of a monopoly. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental regulations. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rental mirror. I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still doesn't loosen up, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps", emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I realized a few days later that I forgot to make the last payment step. Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will come at all? #PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
"Gutschein sounds great. Then I'll redeem it independently during the new order. Thank you very much for the quick clarification!"
When the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take in itself?
I have already cut myself on my finger. That is an absolute cheekiness.
At least 100 dead through tornadoes in Kentucky. During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept through the USA. In Kentucky alone, there may be more than 100 dead to mourn.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone. In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several tornadoes have caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives. The storms left a roughly 200-mile-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Whose governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything is gone everywhere the tornado passed through. Houses, stores, government buildings - simply gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible. He counts alone in the state of Kentucky in the United States up to a hundred deaths, the official numbers are rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the #NAME# display case is sold out. That's very unfortunate. Will it be produced again?
Or is it completely removed from the assortment? Is there the possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you sign up? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but I can only order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had submitted an item through the contact form and wanted to follow up to inquire if it was received or being processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans. While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for vaccination. In doing so, they are in line with social partners ÖGB and WKO, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination today.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - aims to increase willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations.
He switched to a company where he complained about. This does not improve his situation any more than yours. Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year now. He obviously didn't stay put in his old place and went looking for something else. You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares? He didn't like his job either. There are too many variables.
Please take note of the cancellation. That will then be legally relevant. I will take a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign Boron greetings! I am currently leading for a group of 4 friends the adventure Over the Greifenpass and I want to smoothly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players.
We are playing DSA 5. The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I am working on writing the entry adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet. The premise is that the heroes have to bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action should take place. A few miles from the village, the hero should be ambushed by a group of goblins and lured into a trap. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, intimidating, recognizing the danger in time, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed. The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a ditch and flank them to the left and right with three each armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon. If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf. The cart, of course, is gone. 2. If a defeat is inevitable, this half-elf with two of his henchmen intervenes and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great. What do you think of Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will later play a decisive role, so it's not just cannon fodder. Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely consider many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart and put it back together again. And yet it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to return them. Could you please arrange for the return labels to be sent, so that I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, today during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the starting accident disrupted the schedule, it was still possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision. Apparently, however, legal reasons give F1 priority, and therefore everything else must be restricted, which is why Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the entire race.
Nonetheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.
At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something that is possible or required is a puzzle. Both have constant uncertainties about the rules.
Generally, I don't like Roos's artificial commentary style, but I acknowledge that it's a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL even more serious. Additionally, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latter brings a lot of unrest in the commentary, as he clearly does not take it seriously. Advertising simply takes over at Sky, as can be heard in the out lap, where Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary is sufficient and must be played directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overlook the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job except for the advertising during the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the magnificent F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
To the following: #PRS\_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered. I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing has happened. The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady said yesterday that she would check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair). I am requesting support.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filter system using air pumps. We offer this series in 3 variants.
Look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can see the performances compared. If the pumps are strong enough, entire facilities can be operated with them.
If you own a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that you can connect more outflows. The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. However, air pumps are also an option to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a curtain of air (which you can find in our shop) or with decor that converts air bubbles into a function, such as a treasure chest, shell, or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise. The installation is very simple. The fan pump is connected to an outlet, e.g. via a 4/6 mm air hose... and off you go.
The fan pump should be the same height or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between. Simply cut the air hose and install the valve in between.
This would prevent it, if water were to ever run backwards, which would cause the water from the tank to be pumped out by the pump... If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate the processing time as 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and packages are also picked up daily. If everything goes smoothly on the way, it goes very quickly. We just want to prevent a little, so that no one is disappointed, only because it once took a little longer.
It seems that not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry...of course, there is no Corona here. Please do not judge poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services. Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment...they are damn struggling.
This is also very different regionally. Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Can you also order the legs in light colors here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and TV host on short space trip The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space. They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas. Under a brilliant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly crowned astronauts back after their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much each of them paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not disclose. Laura Shepard Churchley reminded after the short flight of the mission of her father. He had worked hard on his missions and had to make everything himself.
She was simply carried away, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm. He would love to go back to space again, said the host.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude. The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated. The capsule that was separated from the rocket during flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman. On the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works or studies in biochemistry, I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject actually quite exciting and I am not bothered by it in the lab (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical). Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, I thought at the time that I definitely wanted to study until I got my doctorate and I will.
Currently, I have doubts, especially the career prospects are quite depressing. On the one hand, you always hear about great career opportunities and the profession is in high demand (Studycheck, etc.), but on the other hand, you always hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really be interested in:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary? 3. What have you studied/What qualifications do you have?
4) Would you do the whole thing again? Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and considering in 2022 possibly dropping out of my studies and doing an training to become a IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them as well :)
Extra stress during vacations and holiday weekends. This topic came up for me last week. However, I had to use this long weekend to relax.
Therefore, let's add a post now. Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress in our company. As it seems, there is also a lot of stress before holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Ascension Day" with us in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official. So there was a long 4-day weekend last week.
What happened last week? Stress everywhere. Hordes of emails that absolutely had to be sent before the weekend, orders here and orders there, everything *absolutely necessary* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because? Because "next week then" after so much time sounds and that shouldn't be allowed to happen? Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also thoroughly exhausted. What is the point of this self-imprisonment due to holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all very independent. My question is simply: Are we, the Swiss, the only ones like this? Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet. "The nice thing is, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, you just go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the festival by baking and frying places with her son. "I love that," said Catterfeld. But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts yet, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth shedding process and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg. NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in birds is exclusively due to nutritional errors. As the feathers are made of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of flawless feathers. For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large portion of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparations should be administered.
NETON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it but unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are, I have received a bed from you. However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them. What do we do now? I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced. The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder. So I will receive new ones.
When will they be sent out? No, no flat ones. According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter. The important thing is that they fulfill their purpose. At my place, they are not flat.
Could I have sent this to you? Hello #NAME#, let me explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage Two people have been slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Bavaria. In addition, an estimated damage in the five-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). According to reports, two residents were taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
That comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo Uğur Şahin, CEO of Biontech, published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021. Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly expressed his vaccination status until now.
Now, the entrepreneur has published a photo that shows his COVID-19 vaccination. The illness of a friend moved him, as Şahin shared. Uğur Şahin, the CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, has published a photo that shows him receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
In social media, there were false information that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network. "For some months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused it because the communication should not revolve around him. But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is struggling with a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Shahin further. He did not ask about the reasons. "The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts alone, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences. An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself", said Şahin at the time. There is prioritization in Germany for vaccinating the vaccine. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the Biontech CEO has been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power. On Friday evening, the lights went out in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no power and in many cases also no heating. A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with heavy damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours. The fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities on Friday evening. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally fully resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and female helpers of the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have imposed significant restrictions. We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will still take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily restore some cables, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company statements. Power is flowing again. The fire that broke out on Friday around 7:15 PM heavily damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to Westnetz.
There are extensive cleaning and repair works required there. At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been established. With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again. An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm. Since 11:15 pm, even those who were previously affected by the outage have had power.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed. The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It is important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially for older or single people, and inform the local fire stations when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed strom-dependent medical devices or were dependent on medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is about the bedspread #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a beautiful day as well and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the subframe on the tabletop. It is a Custom #NAME#. There are three versions available.
We wanted to get those with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#, we got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it around and thus shorten it. Can you help me with that? Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it would otherwise not be suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback.
Sure, that's much easier! Then we'll do it like this: Please send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat. However, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG# before purchasing.
Should I do it now?
A discount that low, I find almost impolite. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins  German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia. Once again, the duo had to give in to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who started with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Reverse of order number #NUMBER# When will the money be credited back to my account?
Sure, here's the translation:  "Yes, we both have s new made and use version 4.5... it could be that they have often heard of problems."
I directly bought a book with my #PRS\_ORG#, it seems to be the case. As soon as I want to open it, the message appears, ups! This document cannot be opened.
"Datei ist möglicherweise Fehlerhaft melden sie beim Kundenservice. Soweit ich es erkennen kann ist es eine #PRS\_ORG# epub Datei. Können sie mir weiterhelfen?" translates to:  "The file may be defective. Please report to customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can you help me?"
"Chat connection is down and now? I also have to work in between!"
To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clean water, and dry them. Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes. You can do this on the inside of the parts that will not be visible later or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the wall should be drawn with the brush stroke by stroke evenly. Light overlapping of the color layers will ensure a uniform surface later.
Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces. A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors. The dark ones might otherwise shine through. Metallic tones and metallic colors come last with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be unattractive metal flakes when they mix with normal colors. Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before weathering them. The models achieve their true original appearance through decals or stickers.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names up to decorative strips and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch. Apply the decals in the correct sequence while the parts are still accessible. It is easier to apply decals to an aircraft cockpit before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are patience, a steady hand, and time when it comes to applying decals. Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them as needed. Decals are also known as water transfer prints because you moisten the back of the paper briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just push the image a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand). While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, you gently pull the carrier paper sideways away. Attention: Always check first if the image sits correctly before completely pushing the image away from the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Squeeze out excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look for something else, I can no longer read and have to log out and log back in and find the place where I left off reading. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive this by email? Even for all 3 packages? Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Okay, thank you anyway! I will buy it somewhere else as soon as the money is back. Will I get the problem-free one back?
Fertility treatment under statutory health insurance / What is an "insurance case"? Hello everyone, we were in fertility treatment for a while, but now that it comes to billing with statutory health insurance, it suddenly becomes complicated.
In sequence: We had applied for the fertility treatment at the statutory health insurance (PKV) in advance and received the approval for three attempts. The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was covered by the PKV. Some time later, we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these towards the PKV yet. We applied for the cost coverage again with the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts. The reason: with pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire. The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the GTC, however, "The insurance event begins with the healing treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists." The questions to the experts in the round here: * Who is right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (5 attempts have to be reimbursed)?
* Should the statutory health insurance have informed us in the benefits that with a birth, further attempts would be forfeited? * Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here. Thank you very much for your help already!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best achieve them?
Alright. We won't be ordering from them anymore. When they add the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), it's obvious that they've lost a good customer.
They may certainly forward this to their manager. This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now he says I have to send the item back first. I can't do anything about the fact that the commode is completely disturbed when it arrives at my place, can I? Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot.
There it is clearly stated that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account. We will no longer do this.
No, the defect only occurred after several months of use. A desk chair should be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they shouldn't sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless, the warranty lasts for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain packaging in any other way. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in that way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG promoted products. Are these products being advertised in addition to purchasing hookers, which we unfortunately cannot find with you. Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits. Wikipedia has the following to say about it:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, for example, on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it? And what might you not like at all?
I am a very satisfied customer of yours, having already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. Has the delivery time been extended again? Is it now also reliable?
Thank you Very friendly greetings There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, the waiting position does not change... I will give up again soon because it simply does not work here. Hello
"Partial victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated. According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "partial victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime. However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, stated the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP). This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely insignificant, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong judged.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. As the EU as a whole has not decided to take a stand against this, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights. This development also weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state insists on doing things its own way, like Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border. Furthermore, the EU is paying a price for its border policy with Belarus, as Bossong points out: the fundamental principle of asylum policy is being undermined, as the line 'border protection, border protection, border protection' has been strengthened." Another attempt at border crossing.
According to reports from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to cross the border from Belarus into Polish territory. 55 migrants were arrested overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday. Polish officials were pelted with stones near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard recorded 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months, or attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU. Poland and Lithuania, according to press reports, have sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country. In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent departures. The most effective element of the EU's reaction, according to Bossong, is the pressure on the airlines.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial measures." Minsk must also consider the internal political costs. The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the security apparatus to regularly push thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale, as they believe Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race. Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed a protest.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest refers to an alleged breach of the rules by Max Verstappen in the last Safety Car phase, where he is said to have overtaken irregularly. A second objection has been lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-compliant manner. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was on his way to his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I am checking that. I am speaking with the bank and will report back to you. Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag. The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited members and season ticket holders of the club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, to visit the park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages. The roller coaster trains glowed through the shirts red and white. Foxes, Ed Euromaus, and many red-white balloons provided the perfect setting," said the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesligisten and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it has once again been shown how well the partnership fits. Shining fans who enjoy the roller coaster together confirm this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is this €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home" as part of the "LiteraTour North" reading series. The author read from her current novel "At Home" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also moderated the event. She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens sensitively to the nighttime sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your idiotic chat and poorly delivered cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you will correct and not all from our household. Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday in a chat that I, or Mrs. #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return label. This email has not arrived yet. The package is to be delivered to #PRS\_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true. That's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners. You won't believe either of them.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself, you should simply let it go completely. Wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously challenges evolution is simply completely lost. As far as I'm concerned, God started it all. But if you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just spreading nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically planar-achromatic lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and color errors even in the outer zone. Often loupes are marked with magnification specifications.
These statements apply only to exactly defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the conditions of use. In order to be able to use your loupe optimally, we kindly ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions in the packaging). Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact lenses.
By applying an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. If the optimal usage conditions are followed - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. Further information can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are searching for Christmas trees. Landowner Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations during his Christmas tree sales. Once, a man even drove home alone because he and his partner couldn't agree on a tree.
Every year, he plants around 2000 pieces for this. The 56-year-old has already experienced so many curious situations. This makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit fun, he says.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, I'm out as a customer! After all, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And therefore, they both have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which definitely doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks. Unfortunately, I am now having trouble building a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a 50 Mbps DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbps flawlessly, except for a few failures. The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbps to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module attached to the FritzBox, these are also received. However, at the other DLan module that transmits WiFi, I no longer receive the full 500 Mbps, but the more I move away from the module with the socket (which is located in 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less I receive.
This results in the Internet being slower in the first floor with the new fiber optic connection (~45 Mbit) than before. I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with fiber optic cable through the power line, and is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables throughout the house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created this account specifically. Therefore, I would be all the more grateful for a response.
When it's time to switch to a current account, who would have thought that there would be peace and quiet with current accounts, is being deceived. While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their customers' fee increases from the past with various tricks, the free balances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now they have simply halved the allowance and even quadrupled it for savings accounts. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request. And that's not just for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the case with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the free balances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks have now also set a free balance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the online portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers there, which even won in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutes should form reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally illegal and have to refund millions to bank customers.
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston leads a whole beauty army and is now officially at the top of Hollywood. But her life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was elected by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year. For her, who made a fuss in 2021 with the reunion of "Friends" and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is above all the result of a lot of discipline and work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
Anyway, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, read correctly: just ONE chip from the bag). It's actually a miracle that her hearts equally fly away in both male and female fans. Perhaps because she just has bad luck - and is still looking for her great love.
And crossed out the baby wish from the list. Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. This hurt her.
The people who asked don't have a clue what's going on with me medically, as to why I can't. It was really hurtful. Hopefully, success and fame will bring happiness.
Undeserving end to a career: Räikkönen has to give up Kimi Räikkönen's farewell to Formula 1 ended quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn wiped the sweat from his forehead and surrendered.
That's it. After a driving mistake and a minor tire touch, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance. It was his 349th and final Formula 1 race, as the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich achieves 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sports The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot. "I've calculated that, I would have to average nine and a half victories per season, then I could achieve it by Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack by 0.5 tenths on Saturday, moving up from third to first place. Then he made some adjustments to the material settings and on Sunday, he drove 0.30 seconds ahead with a larger lead. With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British driver Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd win in a row. Johannes Lochner from Berchtesgaden, who drives for Stuttgart, finished fifth this time after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner. Nolte won with a home victory, and Jamanka earned a podium finish.
On her home run, Laura Nolte collected her third season win in the two-woman bob at the women's event. After only managing fourth place the day before in the monobob, she stormed to victory on Sunday as part of Germany's triple triumph with pusher Deborah Levi in the World Cup. Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen finished second with the fastest sprinter in Germany, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded, in addition to her Olympic qualification, her first podium finish this winter. The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig. For me, it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I am very pleased with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there's also a lot to do around it". Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction".
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now! What should I do?
I haven't received it either and therefore couldn't redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time for it. And now they said it had expired, which really annoyed me.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare seat bench.
I want to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipment only started on March 16th when there was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website?
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
"Your colleague collected it yesterday. Why is it a problem today? I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered item."
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one, not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear wonderful girls and women, I have something I simply want to write and maybe it will go for one - or others as well...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, I am a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child. My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, he burned himself 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to burns). He's also burnt and we currently see each other less often (1-2 times a week) which doesn't work well for my needs of affection and love. My dog is currently experiencing stomach pain, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I used a warm lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month now. Now we also have to do household chores that we naturally divide among ourselves. But cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS condition is currently well regulated, I am more or less well treated and managing. Not good, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free. My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and tomorrow afternoon I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space there. So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then it continues after that, right?
Only until the birthday. Only until the holiday begins. Only until the weekend.
Only until... And so it goes on forever. I believe I just need these mental cues because otherwise I'll mess it up.
In some way, I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way... Does it also happen to you? Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express it in words. I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise. I think it also has a lot to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a refreshing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color and surface is scratched and the table leg has a print. In the first delivery, the color was exactly like on the website. We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me? If we switch tables now, will I get a different color or something?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#. In any case, it was sent twice. However, it was not confirmed.
There was so much more to it: I realized in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject like math or geography for them. For me, that was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed. What do you think?
Perhaps you can also talk about colleagues from work or studies with different attitudes. I generally understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate them. There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it seems strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity. What would motivate someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? To preserve culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or something? Please write in English, I understand it well. That's already been like this for a long time, so I would give up on it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a response soon, no later than the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hello dear people, I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I believe it was a movie for young people. In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure). Because I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman. And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot emerges. The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can continue to live, I believe. The transition, I believe, is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If this resonates with you, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach from week 1. Fast forward: still alive :D Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one might think. Make sure everything around them is in order, no stuffed animals, occasionally go in and take a look, but no continuous monitoring. That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows.
And we didn't have a sleeping bag, we always had a blanket. Observe your child when they sleep. Does they turn their head to the side?
Can something be straightened out from the belly? Or does it lie face down directly on the mattress? You can tell from this whether everything is in order.
We are all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the children to sleep on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have purchased many articles. But why are you then only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It concerns my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe.
Please contact me as quickly as possible. The cupboard is currently not usable.
To be quite clear, RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV. But it's just so easy that the politics of this broadcaster are now under all sauce. Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then they go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard." What are you now?
In the 0815 advertising sender, he tries to bring his billboard to the elite fan. And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, these apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people. A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ash out of the rented rooms that exploded at the expense of the action. How can all of this be good?
That's great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
I am requesting a return, as the wooden table delivered to me is defective. The body is damaged due to a damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort for stomach ache or simply for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile. Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it again in a dosed manner. The removable inner cushion can be heated up very easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when things aren't going so well. The cherry pit cushion with cover is exclusively intended as a warmth application for the following purposes: to check for unusual odors, stains or burn marks on the cushion before warming it up, and to dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up! Warm the inner cushion in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (following the manufacturer's instructions!). After heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the cushion by shaking it.
After that, lay the inner cushion back in the cover. There may be a slight moisture formation on the surface during the first warm-ups, but this disappears with repeated use. Please follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Please check before warming the pacifier in the microwave whether heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions. After the warmed inner pad has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pacifier on your wrist to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C)! Do not use the pacifier with acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory complaints, fresh bruises, blood blisters, and open wounds, as well as with people with reduced pain perception.
Please consult a doctor before using this product if you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or cancer conditions, or if you are pregnant. If any stitches have opened and loose beads have come out, dispose of the product and the loose beads immediately and keep them out of reach of children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, monitor the baby's temperature regularly during use to rule out overheating.
All incidents related to the product that have occurred must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority in the country where the user is based. The product is removable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, things are not going well under the third coach either. Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power supply. I bought this one about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be enough for operation. False error, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the plugged-in power supply. Therefore, I removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation? Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to be brought to my room. How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment? No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design! The 20-liter capacity swallows even larger photo equipment with ease, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what else do you need in everyday objects, remains organized and separable from the photography equipment thanks to practical accessories in the individually configurable interior. With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The stylish, minimalist design has it in a nutshell - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide quick access to photography equipment.
This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already been proven in messenger bags. In the locking flap, there is a metal locking hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken different "fill levels" into account: there are actually 4 anchor bars, firmly attached, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it's emptier, a deeper one. The flap closure and hook are also magnetically attached. This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook having to be pushed in.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the top lid, there is also a ripstop opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail significantly enhances the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you don't just carry your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily separate the two - and also independently access them through the two side openings. In addition, you can also pull the backpack from the right side away from your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain safely in the left backpack compartment and do not interfere. Comfortable, adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer layer of the backpack is made completely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it's supposed to rain in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the email from their support. #NAME# informed me by email yesterday about the confirmation of the commissioning of the contact by the shipping company for the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
I have not received a message yet. I kindly request immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support member, with none of whom I have progressed beyond the promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It needs to be clarified when the cabinet could be delivered again? Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on January 12th, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will place a larger order, but in any case, I will keep the damaged piece of furniture and not send it back. And that the past year did not go as planned, I could not have imagined and could not have redeemed and clarified it on time. But as a customer, I do not accept the damage.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of dynamic drivers who appreciate the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake discs are produced by casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut). All custom-made discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are unique to certain discs and designs.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that takes into account the cutting of the disc according to the properties of the original installation. The thus produced tuned discs ensure high comfort and braking efficiency. Additionally created openings increase the cooling effect of the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted windows emphasize the character of every car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining pieces of gold in the water at the southern fork of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country. Areas were surveyed, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many, it meant "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas. You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers have the same idea! You must surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to end up with the rest of them bankrupt.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory. You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that gradually works for you (known as "Engine Building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or bend rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments. Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma) to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California gained official statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Afterward, their choices are revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a blockade!
This disables half of the location - reducing the possible actions there. Then, the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes. Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer spins around to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, i.e. has covered every location once, and the year ends. There is a shooting range where players must defend Coloma against an impending bandit attack.
If the players have contributed enough gunmen and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards. If they fail, they will receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery. The game ends after the third shootout, followed by the final tally.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I take the shipping method up to size 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm, shipping method (games follow). For everything else, I usually use DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games follow, wrapped in plastic and bubble wrap).
If you want to be a collector, I can also send the carton in a carton for an additional fee of 2 euros, so that it reaches 100% no printing office.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on child-rearing. Now, former patients and legal guardians are making serious accusations against him.
Please be aware that the film is very difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. Parents and other responsible parties should never, ever, ever! Exercise power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation. Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries consulting on the abolition of testing requirement for triple vaccinated. The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated at their next meeting. "We need quick clarity on whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek. Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to "propose it to the Health Ministers Conference already on Tuesday next week." - afp
I also want to return the lamp. What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me?
I am unable to complete any purchases through my #PRS\_ORG# account. Error message: Oh no, an error has occurred. Purchasing through the #PRS\_ORG# website on my computer is working.
I have updated the account details. What could this be due to?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, which means sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000. Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that involve a higher rate of awareness, as one avoids deep anesthesia to protect the child until weaning. Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), carry a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition. I misunderstood their comment.
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help with that either. Those are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair. This is in addition to the legal obligation, also a standard in the field of eCommerce. Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately then, and we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email which you did not reply to. Once again, the question. In the order and on the invoice, it says that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier is company #NAME#. I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I will have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me. Will I not be called?
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He made a name for himself as a theater critic and later wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on Friday. There is a new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An Old Man Gets Older". It is a shocking diary of a slow farewell from the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby testify my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets. One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria. The production value was around 79 million euros. The number of pallets imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

Beef Roll Tips & Tricks I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash. It was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that :) Now I've come to my senses and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve. Tomorrow I will prepare a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
What's next? What about the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English may not be as good, but I'll figure it out.
The text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund was made. However, the money has not yet been received in my account until today.
Please check this.
Where there is still Christmas roast in the room of Lübeck, for many people goose or duck belong to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts. Have you not yet bought poultry?
Now is the time running out. We will reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME control, you can adjust both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "gain" and distortion. As mentioned earlier, the POWER LEVEL regulator can even be used to boost performance when it gets too loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. Here, the signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression, even when using headphones or direct recordings. You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX input, so that you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner. If you also get a VFS5 foot switch, you can conveniently call up sounds with your foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects. For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I've seen that with others. Is there a chance you can send the lamp back because it's too low for over a dining table?
"Also, I would also like to send them back. Can you help me with that?"
And the chest of drawers? Will we receive another update in the next few weeks on the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with a voucher or a discount. Under certain circumstances, I might even find a buyer for the furniture. But I'm not willing to pay more than 1,000 euros for items that I don't need.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran is making progress in talks on nuclear agreement  According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations to revive the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are about to agree on the topics on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency Irna on Sunday.
This is a "positive and significant development," as there was initially no consensus on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks were resumed on Thursday after a brief interruption of almost a week.
At the negotiations, negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating. There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but it is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state now has highest coronavirus incidence Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide. As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a coronavirus incidence rate of over 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day incidence rate with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence rate nationwide, the value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but was still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported within a day. On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in hospitals with intensive medical care.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting. In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand. As the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right? Do I not need to click or fill anything else in?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to kindly request that you allow me to cover the cost of the return shipping. An 8-euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, outrageous.
It's time for changes ###MBundestag greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day! #Why is the post here?
Looking at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past few months, one can conclude: it is not existent. We have entered a winter stalemate and extended the summer recess for several months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what's the matter? For the most part, it is likely due to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we generally stand. In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many here still have a strong desire for the Federal Assembly.
What needs to be changed Here, the community around the German Bundestag is being asked, who wants to keep this alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found a, to put it simply, pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have expressed an interest in rebuilding the project. However, I would like to expressly call upon everyone to participate, only in this way can this project have a future. We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server through this link. Goals: * How should the German federal parliament function in the future?
* What existing arrangements need to be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future? * How can new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system? I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a lot, but that's okay, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the time and interest, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide on the future democratically.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still being delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste. I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed it when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope it will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Does the #PRS\_ORG# daily towel come in a larger size, such as 240/240, for example?
#PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective wardrobe will be picked up promptly. And I kindly request that this be arranged now. I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup - #PRS\_ORG# must clarify how this can be done.
PRS\_ORG can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time do I have to arrange this and decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan? Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like. She has also lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently hardly ever eats meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years. When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that is, I used to think that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but I eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. In that moment, I had the impression that disapproval arose on their side, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, animal suffering is reduced. Now I wonder if my answer was too "simple"?
How do you answer the question? Have the feeling of being quickly put in a corner as a vegan and conflicts arise without even wanting to engage in it. It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
This does not constitute an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will be unable to collect my return at the designated location on the assigned date, as I will be unable to attend due to a funeral. Unfortunately, this cannot be changed. Could I please be assigned an alternative collection date?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available consistently.
Lahnsteiner rescue station equipped for water rescue: Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, recently handed over a subsidy of 45,000 euros to the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte, for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security. I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this matter," says the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte. The device is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, they permanently count on increasing deployments: The boom in hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Alright then, I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS\_ORG# collection for June. Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking the time to address this issue. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e., we were both armed personnel in the executive branch. I don't want to go into this any further! The question of right and left is always oversimplified in my opinion. Fundamentally, one should say that a civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people dressed in special uniforms and carrying weapons on the right of conservatism are naturally attracted to conservative magic. It should also be clear to everyone that these people cannot handle the lived reality. Of course, besides the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the overly feminine stereotype of gay men, because there are fewer to none of those in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women whom you don't notice unless they tell you), and on these people I can and must rely. After all, in doubt, they will save your life or put it on the line for you. But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, represent a conservative stance in my experience, they are proud of Germany and feel disregarded by overly left-wing politics, even if this politics claims to speak for them or thinks it has to make it right for them. They simply want to be treated normally. Back to the right, of course, you will also find extreme right-wingers in the police and military, but
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, begin to generalize and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences. Also, it happens that right-wing sympathizers meet who engage in lively thought exchange. Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well fought against and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very internationally entangled, and that's good in my opinion, that we can't afford to have actual racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand what this is about. I have also ordered the other basket from Germany. Why would it come from England? When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It is still about my order that is no longer deliverable. I previously chatted with #NAME#. Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Ordinary by child? Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a matter for a long time. I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but I have been struggling to keep my household clean and tidy for my entire life.
There are always phases where everything stays put, and then occasionally it hits me and I clean up. But it's never really "in case someone might drop by spontaneously". My husband (unfortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time the household just loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen will be cleaned most regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to get your child to become more organized? We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been occupying me for a while.
For me, I have no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable. Do people with children have a greater motivation or do they remain sloppy? I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers a maximum of comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-shaping with special, deeper engraving at the joints for improved mobility (at arm and knee bends) For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further enhance comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbow and knee bends) High-quality pre-shapes in the lower back area and in the step ensure a tight-fitting, perfect seat. Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when putting on and taking off equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection. Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face of the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet). The soft zone located in the collar improves sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the coating or stitching. Double fasteners with zippers connect a detachable inner sleeve with a soft, padded neoprene outer sleeve.
45° pre-curved seam at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load-bearing capacity when donning. Long ripstop zipper at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without hood. Long G-Lock back zip (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent).
Tear release valves on arms and legs, neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the tear release valves to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels glued flush with outer and inner overlapping.
The edges of the external flanges are bordered for greater load capacity, while the edges of the internal flanges are indented for increased flexibility. The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder? I have completed an education in software development and have been out of college for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am increasingly realizing that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD). This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe I have improved in this regard).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support. However, I don't know if the concrete work routine is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("I've messed up again with the simplest things") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"He must really think I'm underqualified" etc.). I will probably have these problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment. What do they mean by "return please"?
When I download a book from #PRS\_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS\_ORG# does not authorize this book" appears. Is there a problem?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the feed (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own body proteins from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather renewal in breeding birds are extremely complex processes and are closely connected to the overall organism of the animal with a particularly high strain. Please note that NEKTON-Bio may not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
After this inadequate dose of NEKTON-Bio, it should be resumed to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement). The protein taken in with the feed (protein) is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up its own body proteins from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather renewal in breeding birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disturbances in the breeding process. After this brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement). 1 g of NEKTON-Bio should be mixed with 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily. One level teaspoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In cases of severe feather damage, double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the start of new feather growth is visible.
According to this, the normal dose should be administered until the feather formation is completely finished. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without sunlight, at a temperature between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but this chair is sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and I attached some pictures. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in conflict with the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled. A request for felling has been submitted to the municipality. An employee informs me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
In the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly named as a tree to be protected. Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not? On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear. Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message, well, I still have a sofa that has not been used. Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, the question is just whether I can pay in euros and have the cover shipped to Germany. Can you check that?
Notification: Serious traffic accident on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg has occurred recently. As the police press alarm currently reports (14:03), a car has come into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Alright, I understand. Good, thank you again that it was so easy!
At and ideas for further career prospects. First of all, happy Christmas to you! Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I start digging here, briefly: I need advice, preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you. I am currently doing the Ref as a career changer. Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't want to mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me. At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that was it - even though the framework conditions were much less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me. I am now at my third "I google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year so far. Before the paints, I always decided to continue and at least finish the undercoat, afterwards I can still change my mind. But right now, I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me. Before the retreat, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my downtime was my downtime.
At that time, I was free. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now, even the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me. Fundamentally, it's fun and from an external perspective, the referee also runs well, what concerns feedback and so on. But I'm completely exhausted and ask myself, how much stress my body can withstand before it completely closes - if it doesn't do that already.
I am asking myself whether I want to continue the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or whether I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was appropriately paid for it and worked together as a team, not as a lone fighter like now, where I spend most of my time. But then I ask myself if I won't be in the same situation in a year's time as I am now and be unhappy. You can see, it's all a bit confusing, but maybe as outsiders you have ideas or suggestions on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely fed up with and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make emotional decisions at the moment, that probably leads to nothing good. But maybe your opinions will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Even these amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001. Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers. The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday with a score of 104:106.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Klett-closure fasteners, it adapts completely to your photography equipment needs and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-frame SLR cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses. A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a hot shoe flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still leave room for more lenses. Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and non-photography items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: possibly longest in history In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is since Sunday the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island. So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in the year 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are not making any predictions about when it might end. The indicators suggest a slowdown. "The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions The more than 1,000-degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2,900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE, in the little over three months since the eruption began. Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 170 soccer fields. More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros. Off the coast, two new landings were formed by cooled lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Heavily affected was above all the immensely important banana cultivation on the island, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption. 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely impacted, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts Christmas stands at the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension have something tempting about them.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold together our increasingly divided society. Therefore, it is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-building social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition. As Nicholas became the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated Christmas with gift-giving. Prior to this, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in some way. The background of this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night, in order to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular German custom of filling children's shoes with gifts. Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "saint veneration." For these reasons, they distance themselves from the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition. The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve as a result. However, since most Protestants no longer see such details as important, it only bothers a few people that the tradition of St. Nicholas, like the Martin's Day celebration with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, remains a firm part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one can find everything the heart desires, from shoes by the door to socks under the Christmas tree, to coveted luxury watches. A variety of traditions in Christian countries attest to a tradition of giving that dates back to the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who brings the children their gifts. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who in principle is a kind of Nicholas, with whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Christ Child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame. Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sled of the Troika. In the Czech Republic, the land of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is the Christ Child who is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been receiving this error message for three weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact details are up to date. Please help me to resolve this issue, otherwise I will have to buy another e-book from #PRS\_ORG#.
I inquired about a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# last week and also this morning. I was told that one would be sent to me. However, I have not received it yet (not even in the spam folder), so I would like to inquire now about the usual duration of this process.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace  In the vicinity of Kensington Palace in London, a man suspected of being a bank robber was shot and killed by police on Saturday. The police reported that callers had alerted them to a man armed with a weapon who had allegedly entered a bank and a bookmaker's business.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was later stopped by officials. Shots were fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not believe it was a terrorist attack. There are several embassies in the vicinity of Kensington Palace. The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also reside there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I will be redirected to your page immediately.
The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden. The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes. Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum brightness of 10 hours - The robust plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round. In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
Quite harmless is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The rounded, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day. Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
"Smart Stone" performs well in neighborhoods with larger gravel and boulders, where it can assert itself due to its size. You can save significant effort: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light. Simply place the "Light Stone" at any sunlit spot during the day.
Two delivered earth spades ensure a firm grip when needed. The matte white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant. Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing. "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically as dusk falls; in which color, you decide yourself: In addition to daylight white, you have six attractive light colors to choose from. Finally, the switch-off also takes place automatically, as soon as the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew from the beginning the next day.
I have already done this several times, it doesn't work.
Sorry, I would have liked to place another order with you, but if the coupon is not credited to my account, I will not order from you again for principle. If you decide otherwise, please let me know. Otherwise, this will be the last contact today.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard. Anyway, no hardware store was open during the lockdown...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again. A variable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a very quiet operation, especially with bell armature motors - the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past. The load control can now be adjusted up to 10 CVs and adapted to even difficult cases.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor. The LokSound 5 decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough for older motors. - Please use the eBay shopping cart so that shipping costs are calculated correctly.

Pill problem Hey lovely ladies, I hope I'm doing this right, is this actually my first post after a year on Reddit?
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had incredibly bad period pains and premenstrual syndrome. Now I would like to stop taking it again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pains, but my skin.
I had suddenly gotten around 100 explosion-like pimples from 0 within the last approximately two-year break, and they were everywhere. So far so superficial, but it bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel well. During the two-year break, it never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this. My cosmetics are already scent-free and without noise, but maybe someone can recommend something to me. Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, skin is such a thing. I had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread knötchenflechte and the acne theme.
In terms of nutrition, I have tried everything under the sun with my Christian illness and have ended up sticking to a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat because nothing else has worked so well. It may also be good that hormonally, the worm is simply in there, but when you, like me, have construction sites everywhere, you don't want to go looking for anything else that might otherwise go wrong.
I had already written everything to her colleague, seminars and so on, and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was replied to my matter. I have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But he is generally available in large print because it is available in large black letters.

In the name of the people: Lay judges pass judgments in everyday clothing in the courtroom. But their verdict depends on a lot, even if they don't wear a robe: jurors determine, along with professional judges, how long someone will go to jail.
Two of them report in conversation with the "public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately, I cannot access my customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We cannot keep it for so long. We would use the table, as offered by them, as if it were ours.
Sure, had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and also received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now wanted to get one in gray.
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for collection and refund? And when would the collection be?
A 10 kV underground cable will be built new in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable near Tann is legally binding. The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision paves the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
Bayernwerk, the network operator, has now announced that the approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the Tann transformer station in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a mast for overhead lines near the Edermanning village in Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially with us so far. The blue betsellnummer:#PRS\_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me how the next step will be? Have a nice start to the week!
This is a glass commode and all the sides are bulging out, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged. The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come to the apartment due to #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be collected because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Lesson Plan (EK) Hello dear colleagues, I have been in the Ref since the summer and I enjoy teaching, but I currently have major problems with time-efficiently planning my lessons in the subject of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not very well equipped technically, so I basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media. In addition, I can only black and white print for free at school (which is annoying for geography). I currently just need a lot of time to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geographical factors, and for me, every hour stands for itself. In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I always start my planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am not satisfied with most of the tasks in the book. Therefore, also the worksheets. Maybe a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#. I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Retail fears Christmas business due to the 2G rule. In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered may enter. The retail industry considers this unnecessary and laments revenue losses.
A possible solution is also at hand. The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail trade from the point of view of the German Retail Trade Association (HDE). Umsatzeinbrüche are to be expected with articles of non-daily need, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies look negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many have already written off the Christmas business. "What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week. It is only going well in the food retail trade and in the online sector. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
Shopping with masks, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO. "2G shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations deterred customers and required high personnel effort.
The band regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded. According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the received band that day. In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as they already are in public local transport for the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop specializing in shopping centers spoke of difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent. These numbers are now falling in the middle of such an important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers. This includes the so-called "wristband solution," where "visitors, for example, can present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel, can enter all stores unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler. It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it. How do I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp. In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is its ease of use and intuitive operation.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light that is completely flicker-free. The 120-degree emission angle allows you to illuminate large areas with relatively small distances, which is excellent, especially in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, there is a slot there for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User interface The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To adjust the settings for each memory location, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time. The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. This is due to the ability to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display indicators (the left battery in the upper display, the right battery in the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with current through the included power supply. The construction of the headlight is very simple. You have a 16mm threaded stud for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably adjusted using fasteners on both sides. Attention has been paid to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy-duty use. Additionally, a tilting hinge is included in the delivery range.
The package also includes a bag, which is great. This way, you can easily transport or store the lamp and any additional accessories you may want to purchase.
Sorry, I got a gift that is too small :(.
"Party, which we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt! After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had lost their last two games in a row, seemed to be on their way to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned it on, got rid of their frustration from a mixed start to the season within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise" to everyone involved. At first, it looked like another disappointment for Frankfurt, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach. "How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance", so Glasner further. I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game day and overcame his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result, especially for the spectators. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus within himself, but he is also well-prepared in terms of personnel. It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition. It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle.
No one wanted to "go step by step and remain humble" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level". Next up is an away game in English week on Wednesday at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 pm, Sky).
I received the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# to have it redirected, but there was no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
This would unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball before the quarterfinals against Spain  Germany's women's handball team sneak off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliating defeat against Denmark. At the end of the World Cup group stage, the DHB selection suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener. Against Spain, we have to act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished group III of the main round with 8:2 points as second behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't keep the flow. That was a bad game from everyone that we have to erase, said captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for qualification for the semi-finals, we must make a clear improvement against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup on the coming Tuesday in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in a duel with three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted defender Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now." Not up to par from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the level with the start. Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the German team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack. However, this was not the hoped-for initial spark. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German players struggled to make an impact - and when they did, they mostly failed against Althea Reinhardt, the strong goalkeeper of the Scandinavian team.
The game was called early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since defender Mia Zschocke was sent off shortly after a hard foul on her opponent, who also saw a red card. However, she will be allowed to participate in the quarterfinals. The German national team only started to play better in the final phase of the first half and at least managed to score five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes at 9:19. Once again, the Greens' protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders, to win. As a result, the German team was unable to catch up and left the field as a clear loser.
DACH-Adventskalender Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have managed to secure the Nicholas Day and use this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas Day, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays. How was it like at your home back then?
How about your partner? Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is the most beautiful thing for children?
What about shoe cleaning? Making little cakes? Decorating trees?
Is there music playing? Does the Christmas man come, the Christmas child or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa? It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone puts in the effort to have a beautiful family time around Christmas.
Whether they are now established traditions or something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help with the confirmation of the transfer... etc.
I would like to check if there is a discount code available, similar to how it works with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers. How does that work at #PRS\_ORG#?
The title is there, I am a vaccinating physician in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes. As these will soon be largely completed, it will then move on to some extent to vaccination centers for me. I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personally related (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does it interact with the vaccination...").
My area of responsibility includes informing people about vaccination, determining the indication (a person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and, if necessary, emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical technical assistants. In vaccination teams, we often don't have nurses, but rather (thank goodness!) pharmaceutical technicians for preparing the vaccine, who cannot (are not allowed to?) administer vaccinations, so I usually administer most vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution What exactly is a "Huidlerer"? With this dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, the BR television program "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the "Host mi?" series remained unguessable for the callers this time. No, it was not "a person who is nervous". And neither was it "someone who must everything go quickly".
As, heard the people from the TV moderator, is completely wrong. Whereupon the man from Amberg provided the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many people from the Upper Palatinate. "The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this. With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the better-known dialect word "Houdern". Thus, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for two weeks now. Every time I get a confirmation, I get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later. I've restarted the #PRS\_ORG# device, connected it to my computer, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really so risk-free? This morning I woke up full of motivation to prepare for my upcoming bike tour, and I at least wanted to train a little bit. Said and done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!). Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the journey on any account.
As I couldn't really get a replacement jacket and inner tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around again and take the first train back home with a somewhat bad mood. Then it wasn't technically so bad either, maybe it's even better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour. But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not have this problem often. Now it wasn't too bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old gentleman, who had ridden 120km on them by the time I picked up the bike) were also described as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about having to replace the tire after 80-90km of riding, I'm afraid I'll be in a really bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be flat-resistant, don't they? Now the whole thing naturally sounds very tempting. But are they really so indestructible?
I have little desire now to spend 40€/tire just to be disappointed in the end. Furthermore, I ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment, which seems to be available (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you advise me to go for other tires on a racing bike in general? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! The experts seem to recommend the Durano DD more?
Thank you in advance for the help and kind regards!
Car slams into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for unknown reasons crashed into a central island and then ended up on the oncoming lane, as the police reported.

Hello everyone,  We are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year! Unfortunately, due to well-known reasons, we are only able to allow a maximum of four people in the studio, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of this announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per shift, so we will stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow along! We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30. Start getting your drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
