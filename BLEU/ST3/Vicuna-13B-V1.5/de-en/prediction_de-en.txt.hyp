The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the item's value... I am a #PRS\_ORG# VIP customer, so it's not a problem for me.
I simply need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I have to say, I find this quite frustrating.
Must I cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
I also think it's generally not appropriate to ask children to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I do think it's good for older siblings to help out with their younger siblings to some extent. For example, looking briefly, helping briefly, bringing a bottle, etc.
This way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and are involved. As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem with that. If your K1 is able to entertain themselves for a short period of time and it's okay for them, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether this is suitable for your children. It's not as if he should be wrapped up in K2 and accompanied for hours while falling asleep. Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist. Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book! I read a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but the title won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows the title... The story was about fear and how to therapy it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by covering himself with food and entering his enclosure with his predator cats. The case is taken over by a commissioner who quickly leads to the caretaker's therapist, who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear. The commissioner also has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist's clinic.
There are more suicides and there is a new protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the site and document it, and to post the photos on the internet. At least, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately expose themselves to their fear in the most extreme way (a woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death).
This confronting one's fear is referred to in the book as "the fight." At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with fire. That is the rough plot, and I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or someone even reveals the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available. I have to contact my husband first, but that may take some time.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, Splinter under the thumbnail of the child, four years old, extends over the entire length of the wooden splinter (outer side). We tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp. Did not work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No more chances. Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.
All Bosch electrical tools, pneumatic tools, and measuring instruments are carefully inspected, tested, and subject to strict quality controls by Bosch's quality assurance. Therefore, Bosch provides a warranty for Bosch electrical tools, pneumatic tools, and measuring instruments. This warranty does not limit the buyer's claims for defects under the purchase contract with the seller or any legal rights.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, making it possible to install them in almost any H0 and 0 gauge locomotives. LokSound 5 decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker and a sound enclosure kit.
As with all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder. It masters the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed levels are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thank to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically report to a suitable digital central station. It supports all DCC programming modes, and with compatible central stations, the CV values on the main track can be read out. For central stations that can only program CV values from 1-255, there are auxiliary registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels with 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central units. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections just as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system. Braking with DCC braking blocks or with constant voltage is also possible.
In addition, he also holds with a Selectrix® brake diode. An ABC pendulum train automatic allows for automatic oscillation between two stations. The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railways.
After my voucher was not extended due to a complaint that did not arrive at my address, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere, where customer friendliness is prioritized and I don't have to jump through hoops to achieve nothing at all! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omicron: Johnson will push for booster vaccinations. New Omicron cases are causing politics and science in the UK. Therefore, by New Year's Eve, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccination offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to accelerate the COVID-19 booster vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing Om
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so the vaccine protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson. The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson. On Sunday, 1,239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137. This represents an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. dpa
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent an application. Today, I received an invitation for an interview via email.
I want to respond to the email. But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now. Can someone please help me? I am a foreigner and do not want to step on any officials' toes.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them work. Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect at the time of sale. How can such a damage to the upholstery occur after 9 months otherwise?
First, try the #PRS\_ORG#. But this has not worked for about 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books from the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were no more available. Now they are available again and I would like to please add 2 chairs to my order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content Warning: I will be writing somewhat extensively about domestic violence here. I just need to get something off my chest.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons. A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims do not want to be helped or we think we cannot help them. I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But in my profession, there are fewer things that move me more than when I am unable to do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in a private conversation, out of sight and hearing range of the perpetrator, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, is partly very close to tears, everyone is worthy of living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. It will never be easier that way. Please always remember that you are worth living without violence, it is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring production: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently started on Netflix. Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Giants Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim At least Johannes Patrick, the youngster, let them down. Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, had said with a look back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our belly." But this didn't calm down after the game - on the contrary, it was further intensified in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Where more than the bare result, the manner of the appearance disappointed.
A substitute statistic expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was a mere 13 percent, with 4 successful shots (all by young John Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions? John Patrick provided the answer: "We were simply not focused enough after our win in Tenerife, and we didn't implement what we had trained for." Namely, moving the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted very differently: "It's great to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people." Although only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, they made the most of it.
Not only because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. "The best playmaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim. While in Patrick's team, the key performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) underperformed.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59. In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points. Fortunately, there is not much time for complaining.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I have changed it.
Yes, I had already registered several months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have informed ourselves legally again and have written to them again for this reason.
We had originally already registered half a year ago.
Always peeled from the egg: Max Raabe turns 59 and he is able to enchant his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. But that's not going to happen. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Other appearances planned by the singer during the Advent season must also be canceled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who is celebrating his 59th birthday today (www.palast-orchester.de). From January, the artists then want to make up for the concerts that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic. Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students. Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hits and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women, It's No Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream. Always impeccably dressed, with blonde hair neatly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable in the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good Day, dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance? It can be used to complement existing furniture and we could check in advance whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only sew the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Enteignment does not create new housing The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a Berlin popular vote. "With expropriation, not a single new housing unit is created, only the structure of ownership changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years. By the way, a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to establish an expert commission to decide how to proceed with the outcome of the referendum.
But if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rent law. The coalition agreement provides for a rent price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index. I will speak with the justice minister to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market doesn't loosen up anyway, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I realized a few days later that I forgot the last step in the payment process. Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or whether it will come again at all? #PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great. Then I'll redeem it myself with the new order. Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger. That is an absolute audacity.
At least 100 dead through tornadoes in Kentucky. A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes to sweep through the USA. In Kentucky, there could be more than 100 dead to mourn.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone. On the night of Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives. The storms left a roughly 200-mile-long trail of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of this place, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything is gone everywhere the tornado passed through. Houses, stores, government buildings - just gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible. He counts alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred deaths, with official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME is sold out. That's very unfortunate. Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the assortment? Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when do you report yourself? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had returned an item through the contact form and asked if it had been received or processed, as I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans. While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for vaccination. This puts them in line with the social partners ÖGB and Chamber of Commerce, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched to a company where he used to work. This does not improve his situation any better than yours. Let's wait and drink tea.
It is a year now. He has obviously not stuck to his old spot and has been looking for something else. You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter. He didn't like his job either. There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation. That will then be legally relevant. I am creating a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign Boron greetings! I am currently leading an adventure "Over the Griffin Pass" for a group of 4 friends and would like to seamlessly introduce my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5. The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been planned, and now I am writing the entry adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet. The premise is that the heroes have to bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action should develop. A few miles from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the hero and lure them into a trap. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, intimidating, recognizing the danger in time, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.  Lurking unnoticed, the goblins ambush the heroes in a ravine and flank them to the left and right, each with three bows, while two with spears stop the wagon. If a fight ensues and the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf. The cart, of course, is gone. 2. If defeat is inevitable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his henchmen and comes to the heroes' aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is super. How do you rate Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the encounter as an introduction to the adventure too much?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder. EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely take many of your ideas into account and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I took the lamp apart again. And put it back together. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to return them. Can you then have the return labels sent, so that I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

We didn't make the chair. Suddenly, the crack was there. I just sat on it.
Here was the lower part, so to speak, the part with storage space damaged. Will everything then be taken away or only the storage space part?
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted mid-F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning had put the schedule far behind schedule, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!). Apparently, however, this is not possible for legal reasons, so that everything else has to be restricted, which is why Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it is stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race.
Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was rule ignorance among the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. In my opinion, such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first puzzle-guessing, as now according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
I do not generally like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I acknowledge that it is a matter of taste. However, I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of turmoil into the commentary, as he apparently does not take it seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, where in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Even these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air broadcasters. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overcome the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that covers the F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
To the here: #PRS\_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered. I have contacted the chat twice and haven't received any response yet. The First Lady told me that it will be shipped on Monday, but the Second Lady said yesterday that she would check and send an email, and she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair). I kindly request your assistance.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filtration system using air stones. We offer this series in 3 variants.
Look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can see the performances in comparison. Are the pumps strong enough to operate entire facilities?
Owning a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that multiple outlets can be connected. The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model, but air pumps can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a curtain of air (available from us in the shop) or with decor that converts air bubbles into a function, such as a treasure chest, shell, or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise. The installation is very simple. The fan pump is connected to an outlet or the like via a 4/6 mm air hose...and you can start right away.
The blower pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the blower pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between. Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent it if water were to flow backwards from the tank through the pump... If the blower pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily. If everything goes smoothly on the way, it goes very quickly. We just want to be a little cautious so that no one is disappointed, just because it once took a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry... of course, here no Corona is to blame. Please do not judge it poorly just because the delivery is delayed, this lies exclusively with the parcel services. Of course, one likes to complain about these services, even if we say at the moment... they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally. Don't be angry at anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Can you also order the legs in light color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and TV host into space The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space. They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas. Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly selected astronauts upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in flight and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their tickets, Blue Origin did not disclose. Laura Shepard Churchley reminded after the brief flight of her father's mission. He had worked hard during his missions and had to do everything himself.
She was simply carried away, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm. He would love to go back to space right away, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height. The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automatically. The capsule that was separated from the rocket during flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman. On the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely promoting the business of space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently shine in one color or play through its entire color palette. When the color change is activated, the light stone remains in a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light withstands the outdoors all year round.
In a snow-covered environment, its light is particularly good - only with a shortened light duration can be expected when the days become shorter. Please make sure in winter that no snow impairs the function of the solar module. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format that can be easily replaced if needed.
You can obtain a suitable replacement bulb for your chandelier through our online shop, thus extending the lifespan of your chandelier even further.

Someone who works or studies in biochemistry. I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject quite interesting, and I am not bothered by the lab work (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical). Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time, I also thought that I would definitely want to study until I get my PhD.
Currently, I have doubts, especially concerning the job prospects. On the one hand, you always hear about great career opportunities and the profession being highly sought after (Studycheck, etc.), but on the other hand, you constantly hear about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really like to know:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary? 3. What have you studied/What kind of training have you undergone?
4) Would you do it all again? Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering dropping out of university in 2022 and becoming an IT specialist instead.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them :)
Extra stress during vacations and holiday weekends  This topic came up for me last week. However, I decided to use my long weekend to relax and unwind.
Therefore, let's add a post now. Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas vacation, is there a lot of stress in our company. As it seems, there is also a lot of stress before holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day. So last week there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week? Stress everywhere. Lots of emails that had to go out before the deadline, orders here and orders there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend.
Because... well, because? Because "next week then" sounds strange after such a long time and that shouldn't be the case? Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a short week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed. What's the point of this self-imprisonment due to holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent. My question is simply: Are we like this only, the Swiss? Is this our reformed-evangelical nature?
Or do you know it in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia  Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet. "The nice thing is, even if it doesn't snow in Erfurt, you can simply go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
You will agree to the festival by baking and bastele with your son. "I love it," said Catterfeld. But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "I haven't bought any gifts yet, I have to start finally."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth shedding process and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg. NEKTON-Bio gives the bird smooth and glossy feathers.
The majority of feather damages in bird keeping are exclusively due to nutritional errors. Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of flawless feathers. For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals. The unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account in the composition of NEKTON-Bio. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I have found the function, unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are correct. I have received a bed from you. However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet. What do we do now? I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced. The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder. So I am getting new ones sent.
When will they be sent off? No, not flat ones. According to the assembly instructions, these are the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose. At least, they are not flat at my place.
Could I get this sent over? Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people have been slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Bavaria. In addition, significant damage in the five-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). According to reports, two residents were taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But it comes much later And I have to pay shipping costs again
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021. So far, the Biontech CEO had not publicly commented on his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo that shows his COVID-19 vaccination. The illness of a friend moved him to do so, Şahin shared. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo that shows him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network. "For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has refused because the communication should not revolve around him. But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is struggling with a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask about the reasons. "The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and distrust."
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences. An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time. There is prioritization in Germany for vaccination with the vaccine. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the CEO of Biontech has allegedly been vaccinated three times, according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: Thousands of people without power  In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating. A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage at a substation, ten thousand people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours. As a result of the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities on Friday evening. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late at night.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions. We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts, said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will take several days, as the Westnetz technicians had to temporarily restore some lines, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company's statements. Power has been restored. The fire, which broke out around 7:15 pm on Friday, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to Westnetz.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work needed there. At the same time, an connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 6:00 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again. An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected to the grid starting at 9:30 PM. As of 11:15 PM, even those who were previously affected by the outage had their power restored.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed. The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It's important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially older or single people, and inform the local fire stations when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is about the daily cover #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the undercarriage on the tabletop. It is a custom #NAME#. There are three versions available.
We wanted to get those with a diameter of #NUMBER#, we have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I can't combine it and thus shorten it. Can you help me with that? Otherwise, I would have to return it, as it would otherwise not be suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased to receive feedback.
Yes, that's really easy! Then we'll do it that way. Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat. However, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG# before purchasing.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost shameless. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins  The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia. Once again, the duo had to yield to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who started the cross-country skiing with a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of order number #NUMBER# When will the money be credited back to my account?
Yes, we have both updated to version 4.5... it could be that they have already heard of problems with it.
I directly bought a book from my #PRS\_ORG#, and it seems to be the case. But as soon as I want to open it, the message appears: "Ups! This document could not be opened."
File may be defective, please contact customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can you help me?
The chat connection is gone and now? I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clean water, and dry. Before bringing the brush into contact with the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes. You can do this on the inside of the components that will not be visible later or on a yogurt cup.
Draw the first stroke on the building component with the brush in a uniform stroke beside stroke. Later, the slight overlapping of the color layers will create an even surface.
Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistically looking surfaces. A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors. The dark ones could otherwise shine through later. Metallic tones and metallic colors are added at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unattractive metal flakes may occur when they mix with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them. The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or stickers.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names and decorative stripes on car models: decals give the model that final touch. Apply the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible. It's easier to apply decals to a cockpit before it's installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are patience, time, and a steady hand when applying decals. Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them as needed. Decals are also called water slide decals because you moisten the back of them with water briefly until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just push the image a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand). While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, you gently pull the carrier paper to the side. Attention: Always check first if the image is sitting correctly before completely pushing it away from the paper, so that it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and find my place up to where I have read. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you once.
Will I receive this by email? Also for all 3 packages? Because the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Ok, thank you anyway! I will buy it elsewhere as soon as the money is back. But will I get the problem solved?
Treatment for desire to have children with private health insurance / What is an "insurance case"? Hello everyone, we were in fertility treatment for some time, now when it comes to billing with the private health insurance, it suddenly becomes complicated.
In sequence: We had applied for fertility treatment for children in advance with the statutory health insurance (PKV) and received approval for three attempts. The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth, and it was settled with the PKV. Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and we carried out 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we have not yet settled these with the PKV. We again applied for cost coverage from the PKV and were granted 3 more attempts.
After several more attempts (we have conducted more attempts than agreed, logically we count the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts. The reason: The pregnancy/birth expire the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise. The second desire for a child is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment." The questions for the experts in the round are: * Who is right, the private health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
Had the statutory health insurance (PKV) informed us in the assurances that with a birth, the further attempts would become invalid? Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants per email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
In order. We will no longer be ordering from them. When they add the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), it is obvious that they have lost a good customer.
They may certainly forward this to their manager. This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now you're telling me that I have to send it back first. I can't do anything about the fact that the commode was completely disturbed when it arrived at my place. Please see what the colleague wrote in the screenshot.
There it is clear and unambiguous that the repayment was triggered and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account. We will no longer be doing this.
No, the defect only occurred after several months. A desk chair should be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they cannot sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products being advertised with additional horns that we unfortunately cannot find with you? Can you help?
"Low-budget films are films that are made with a small budget. There is no specific definition with exact budget limits. According to Wikipedia:  "A low-budget film is a film that is made with a budget that is relatively low compared to the average for the film industry. The exact definition of a low-budget film varies, but it is generally considered to be a film that is made for less than $3 million. However, some low-budget films have been made for as little as a few thousand dollars, while others have been made for tens of millions of dollars. The key factor in determining whether a film is low-budget is not the amount of money spent on it, but rather the creativity and resourcefulness of the filmmakers in making the film with limited resources."
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. One can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, for example, on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you? And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. Has the delivery time been extended again? Is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much Friendly greetings Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here. Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated. According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime. However, the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, said the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP). This stalemate - Belarus is not giving in completely, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The handling of the people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stance against this, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights. This development also weakens the cohesion within the Union.
"She apparently can't assert herself when a member state insists on doing things its own way", as is currently the case with Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border. Furthermore, the EU is paying an additional price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: The agreement on the asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at crossing the border.
According to reports from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus. 55 migrants were arrested in the night from Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday. Polish officials were pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months or attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU. Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country. In addition, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure. The most effective element of the EU's reaction would be the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial measures." Minsk must also consider the internal political costs. The Belarusian society may not be accustomed to the security apparatus regularly funneling thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale Max Verstappen is believed to have committed two rule violations during the race. Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the last Safety Car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly. A second objection has been lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in compliance with the rules. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last lap of the Mercedes and was celebrating his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, during which the Dutchman had overtaken the car in front of him.
I am checking that. I am speaking with the bank and will contact you again, thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg Fantag The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag. As the park announces, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages. The roller coasters shone through the shirts red and white on that day. Foxy, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect setting, according to the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it has shown how well the partnership fits. Shining fans can be seen who enjoy the roller coaster together, confirms Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar. My question is whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you correct and not all from our household. Contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# cake, and a return label. This email has not arrived yet. The package is to be delivered to #PRS\_ORG# today.
Please contact me with friendly greetings.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he isn't an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true. That's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners. You won't get either of them to admit it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages. If one wants to distance oneself, then one should simply leave it alone. Yes, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions the evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost. As far as I'm concerned, a God may have initiated the whole thing. But once you're a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken any more seriously than Kollegah.
To obtain the best field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows for practically distortion and color error-free use of the loupe up to the edge zone. Often, loupes are marked with magnification specifications.
These statements apply only to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use. In order to be able to use your magnifying glass optimally, we kindly ask you to observe the information in the table "Technical Data" (see instructions for use in the packaging). On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - including impact magnifiers - light reflections can occur.
By applying an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. With proper use - the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. Further information can be found in the included user manual (available in German and English).

Fir tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees. Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations during his fir tree sales. Once, a man even drove home alone without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for it. The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations. This makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit funny, he says.
And what about the coupon? Otherwise, I'm out as a customer! At least I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both have their name for that reason.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which certainly doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks. Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly and received and sent 50 Mbit with a few exceptions. The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the DLan module that is connected to the FritzBox. However, at the other DLan module that sends the WiFi signal, I no longer receive the full 500 Mbit, but the more I move away from the module with the socket (which is located in 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module), the less I receive (i.e., I am using a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower in the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with fiber optic cable through the power line? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables throughout the house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I have created an account here especially. Therefore, I would be all the more grateful for a response.
When it's time to change the current account, those who thought there would be a break in the current accounts are disappointed. While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their customers with various tricks about the fee increases of the past, the free balances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time. Now they have halved the allowance, and for savings accounts, they have even quartered it. Initially, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request. And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly agreed individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already previously lowered the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the case with ING Germany.
The popular among cost-conscious customers direct bank DKB has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks have already had an allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the online portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers there, which even won a ruling in their favor in the first instance at the Berlin Regional Court.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions - in case the higher instances declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally illegal and millions of euros have to be refunded to bank customers.
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston leads a whole beauty army and is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood. However, her life is like a journey up and down a mountain.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter". For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, that's what Aniston says, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag). It's a miracle that her hearts of both male and female fans still flutter equally. Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with happiness - and is still looking for true love.
And the baby wish has been crossed off the list. Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. This hurt her.
The people who asked don't have a clue about what's going on with me medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. Let's hope that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undeserving end of a career: Räikkönen has to give up Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 ended quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it. After a driving error and a slight touch of the tires, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, marking the end of his career in motorsport's top tier.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 world championship in a Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. (dpa)
Friedrich achieves 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot. "I've calculated it, I would have to win nine and a half races per season, then I could achieve it by Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place. Then he changed something in the material setup and on Sunday, he drove 0.30 seconds ahead with a larger lead. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd win in a row. Johannes Lochner, who drives for Stuttgart, moved up from second place to fifth place this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after placing fourth in the first race. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it too," said Lochner. Nolte with a home win - podium for Jamanka.
At the women's event, Laura Nolte secured her third season win in the two-woman bob on her home track. After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she stormed to victory in the German triple success with brakeman Deborah Levi in the two-woman bob race on Sunday. Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia finished second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded, in addition to her Olympic qualification, the first podium finish this winter. The woman from Wiesbaden, Kim Kalicki, finished third with Leonie Fiebig. For me, it was super cool to achieve my first podium finish in the World Cup. I am super happy that Mariama is accompanying me.
I am super happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, there is also a lot to do around it." Jamanka was a little frustrated with the not entirely error-free rides, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now! What should I do?
I haven't received it either, so I couldn't redeem it. That's why I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and no time for it. And now they said it had expired, which really annoyed me.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th? Nothing was indicated on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I type it in does an extra field appear with the message.
Yesterday it was accepted by your colleague. Why is it a problem today? I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one, not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear wonderful girls and women, I have something I simply want to write and maybe it will go for one or the other...
I am 24, I have kPTBS, I am a full-time student and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child. My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, he burned himself second-degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him take a shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn). He is also feverish and we are currently seeing each other less often (1-2 times a week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love. My little dog just had a stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I used a warm lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month. Now, household chores are piling up on us, which we naturally divide among ourselves. But cooking is especially a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is currently quite well under control, I am more or less well-treated and managing. Not great, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free. My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3:00 PM I have a written exam for which I haven't done anything yet, and on Thursday I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space left. So my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then everything continues, right?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of vacation. Only until the weekend.
Only until... And so it goes on forever. I think I'm just so stressed that I need these mental guidelines, otherwise I can't handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way... Does it also happen to you? Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly grateful, I cannot express it in words. I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise. I think it also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a refreshing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color and surface is scratched and there are marks on the table. In the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website. We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me? Will I get a different color if we switch tables now?
The email for the cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#. Otherwise, it was sent twice. However, it was not confirmed.
Something completely different: I discovered back in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography. For me, that was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed. What do you think?
Perhaps you can also talk about colleagues from work or studies with different attitudes. I generally understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate them. There is also a curriculum, etc.
But wouldn't it also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity? What would motivate someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? To preserve culture or something?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well. This has been going on for a long time, so I would refrain from it.
That's good, thank you. I expect a response shortly, no later than the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hello dear people, I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I believe it was a movie for young people. In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, there is the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman. And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and a action arises. The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead, who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can live himself. I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If that means anything to you, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept on her stomach since week 1. Fast forward: still alive :D Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one thinks. Make sure everything around it is in order, no cuddly toys, occasionally go in and take a look, but no constant supervision. That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows.
So, we didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket. Observe your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something be raised from the stomach? Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress? You can deduce from this whether everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was the custom and practice to lay the children on their stomachs to sleep.
Furthermore, we are already your "regular customer" and have bought many articles from you. But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It is about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit in the wardrobe.
I kindly request you to contact me as quickly as possible. The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly, RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV too. But it's just that the politics of this channel are now completely discredited. Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then they go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that you are an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a continuous billboard." What are you now?
An 0815 advertising broadcaster trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan. And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, these apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people. A Krogmann who lacks any empathy and is trying to make ash out of the rented rooms that exploded at the expense of the action. How can all of this be good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
I am requesting a recall, as the wooden table that was delivered to me is defective. The body is broken due to a damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling – my little heat friend is versatile. Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it again dosably. The removable inner pillow can be heated up easily in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft fabric makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when things don't go so well. The cherry pit pillow with fabric cover is exclusively intended as a warmth application for the following areas of application: Before warming up the pillow, check for unusual odors, stains, or burn marks, and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the pillowcase before heating the pillow! Heat the pillow in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions for your microwave!). After heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking it.
Then place the inner cushion back in the cover. There may be some slight moisture on the surface during the first warm-ups, but this will disappear with repeated use. Make sure to follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Please check before warming the pacifier in the microwave that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions. After the warmed insert has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pacifier on suitability for babies (max. 43°C) at your elbow. Do not use the pacifier with acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish conditions, circulatory complaints, fresh bruises, blood blisters, and open wounds, as well as with individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
For existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, as well as during pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use. If the patches have opened and loose beads have come out, dispose of the product and the loose beads immediately and in a way that is inaccessible to children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the child's temperature should be regularly monitored during use to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authorities in the country where the user is based. The product is removable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
It's not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach either. Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, happiness in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter. I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the power supply alone would be sufficient for operation. Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the power supply inserted. Therefore, I removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Perhaps you have some ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation? Is something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# brought to my room. How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment with you? With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem! The 20-liter capacity easily swallows larger photo equipment, which can be securely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And as for everyday objects that you may need, they remain well-organized and separable from the photography equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior space. With the "update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look. The stylish, minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photography equipment.
This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags. In the locking mechanism, there is a metal locking hook with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has also considered different "fill levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, firmly welded, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
When the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar. If it's rather empty, you take a deeper one. The zipper and hooks are also magnetic. This way, the backpack can be reliably closed without the hook being rusted.
The second feature distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to dig through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you're not just carrying your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily separate and store things from each other - and also independently access them through the two side openings. This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example, to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left half of the backpack and don't get in the way. Comfortable and easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And because the outer layer of the backpack is made completely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it rains in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# informed me yesterday by email about the confirmation of the commissioning of the contact by the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
So far, I have not received any message. I request immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support staff member, with none of whom I have gotten further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It can be seen when the wardrobe could be delivered again? Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help. I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on January 12, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the coupon for me, then I will place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and did not return it. And that last year turned out differently than I had thought, I could not have anticipated it and could not have redeemed and clarified it in a timely manner. But as a customer, I do not accept the damage.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of dynamic drivers who appreciate the reliability and safety of braking, even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake discs are manufactured using casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut). All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are unique to certain discs and designs.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that focuses on the selection of the disc according to the properties of the original installation. The discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency. In addition, the created openings increase the cooling efficiency of the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of every car by an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glittering flakes in the water at the southern junction of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country. Areas were marked off, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many, it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas. You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must surpass your pioneer colleagues, or you will end up bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory. You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or bend rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments. Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their choice is revealed and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a blockade!
This disables half of the location - reducing the possible actions there. Then, the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes. Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, i.e. has hidden each location once, and the year ends. There is a shooting range where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunmen and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards. However, if they fail, they will receive smaller rewards or end up in the cemetery. The game ends after the third shootout, followed by the final tally.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I use the shipping method "Warensendung (Spiele einfoliert)" for items up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm in size. For everything else, I usually use DPD and provide tracking (Spiele einfoliert, mit Flies umwickelt und Packpapier).
If you are a collector, I can also send the card in a cardboard box, which will not come into contact with any printing ink, for an additional fee of 2 euros.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The pediatric psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education. Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to endure. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. Parents and other responsible parties must never, never, never! have power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation. Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries advise on the abolition of the vaccination requirement for triple vaccinated The health ministers of the countries want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide abolition of the vaccination requirement for triple vaccinated. "We need clarity quickly from the federal states, whether and when the vaccination requirement can be abolished for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the conference of health ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to propose it to the Health Ministers' Conference on the following Tuesday. - afp
I also want to return the lamp. What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me?
I am unable to process any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#. Error message: Oops, an error has occurred. Purchases through the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer are working.
I have updated the account details. Why might this be the case?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, which is sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. This occurs at a frequency of about 1 in 1000. Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less commonly seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until weaning. Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, my comment accurately describes awareness, however, u/Nitemarex did not have any by definition. I misread their comment.**
The chair is, however, defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help either. Those are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair. This is in addition to the legal obligation, also a standard in the field of eCommerce. Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately, which means we will also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email which you did not reply to. Once again, I am asking. It says in the order and on the invoice that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The carrier is company #NAME#. I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I must cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor. Won't I be called?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He made a name for himself as a theater critic and later served as an intendant. He also wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97. There is still the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An Old Man Growing Older". The moving diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I already want to testify my gratitude for life here."
There are different types of pallets. One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020. The production value was around 79 million euros. The number of pallets imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against the Philadelphia Union, the team of German player Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash. It was served at Christmas and was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Also thank you again for that :) Now I have developed a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve. Tomorrow I will make a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What happened to the books, and how do I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English may not be as good, but I'll figure it out.
This text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed. However, the money has not yet been received by me.
Would you please check that?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the space of Lübeck, for many people goose or duck belong to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts. Have you not yet bought any poultry?
Now is the time running out. We reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier stage significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can adjust both the desired volume and the distortion content of your sounds.
Additionally, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, with which you can reduce the sound level without having to adjust the "Gain" and distortion. As mentioned earlier, the POWER LEVEL regulator can even be used to create a performance reserve when it gets unreasonably loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The attached signal is processed with a box simulation, so you can get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recording. You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX input, so you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuner. If you also get a VFS5 foot controller, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, turn the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects. For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I have seen this with others. Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back? Because it is too low for over a dining table.
I would also like to return them. Can you help me further?
And what about the commode? Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would be satisfied with a legacy or voucher as well. Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture. However, paying over 1,000 euros for items that I don't need is still a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer, and the wait time was not worth it. Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement  According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are about to agree on the agenda items to be discussed," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building atomic weapons. The Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed on Thursday after a break of almost a week.
At the negotiations, negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating. There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state now has highest coronavirus incidence Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide. As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a coronavirus incidence of over 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased but was still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths in connection with an infection were reported within a day. 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in hospitals with intensive medical care on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting. In addition, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is scheduled for the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I must print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right? Do I not need to click or enter anything else?
I want to avoid exactly that, which is why I am writing to you. I would like to kindly request that you allow me to cover the cost of the return shipping. A return shipping fee of 8 euros is, in my opinion, outrageous.
It's time for changes  Dear German Parliament, I greet you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall at the heart of Europe on a fantastic day! Why is there a post here?
When one looks at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past few months, one can observe: it is not extinct. We have entered a winter stalemate and extended the summer recess for a few months. #Where lies the problem?
Yes, what was the reason? For the most part, this is probably simply due to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we generally stand. In the last few days, there has been a growing impression that many of us still have a strong desire for the Federal Election.
What we need to change  At this point, the community around the German Bundestag is asked which wants to keep it alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days has become aware of this project and has found a, to put it simply, pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found the desire to rebuild the project. However, I would like to explicitly call upon everyone to participate again, only in this way can this project also have a future. We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange with each other and work out concrete things.
You can join the server through this link. Goals:  * How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed? How should we appear to the outside in the future? How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system? I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not too bad, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the time and interest, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide on the future democratically.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still to be delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste. I have already ordered a different hanging from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam. Very sad about that. I hope it will be returned and I get a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: does the daily pillow #PRS\_ORG# come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
PRS\_ORG must be able to guarantee me that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly. I kindly request that this is arranged now. I do not have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for collection - PRS\_ORG should clarify how this can be done.
#PRS\_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time do I have to obtain it or decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan? Today I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like very much. She has also lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently rarely eats meat.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years. When asked if I always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that I thought for a long time that I was supporting animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that annoyance arose on their side, and then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, one reduces animal suffering. Now I wonder if my answer was too simplistic?
How do you answer the question? I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly relegated to a corner and conflicts arise without one's involvement. Greetings from a vegan who loves harmony (;
This does not constitute an exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date, on which #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return in person. Since I cannot be present in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed. Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup date?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available consistently.
Lahnsteiner Dam for water rescue equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state  Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister, Roger Lewentz, presented a subsidy certificate worth 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein at the Lahnsteiner town hall. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security. I am glad that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate supports us in this matter," says Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte. The device will be used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, they are permanently prepared for increasing deployments: the boom in hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations, however, synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work.
I am a bit frustrated because this whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am hoping for help now.
Okay, that's fine. I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS\_ORG# collection for June. Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking an interest in this whole matter. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, that is, we were also armed executives. I do not want to go into this any further! The question of right and left is always presented in a very simplified way. Nevertheless, one should generally say that the civil servant tends to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that people who are attracted to conservatism and right-wing extremism from a special uniform and weapon carrier should also be clear that these people naturally have difficulty dealing with the lived reality. Of course, in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the overly feminine stereotype of gay men, because there are fewer of these in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women whom you don't notice if they don't tell you), and to these people I can and must rely. After all, in doubt, they can save your life or set it up for you. But even these marginal groups, although it may sound strange at first, represent my experience a conservative stance, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less abandoned by excessive left-wing politics, even if this politics seems to be for them or thinks it has to do something for them, they just want to be treated normally. Back to the right, of course, the police and the military are also a cross-section of society, where you will also find
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers, who are often deployed abroad, begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet from time to time who engage in lively intellectual exchange. Nevertheless, in my opinion, such things are well combated and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply entangled internationally, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. We couldn't afford to have actual racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side. Why should this come from England? When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer available. I previously chatted with #NAME#. Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black be delivered to Germany or is this basket available somewhere in Germany?
I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow, and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Ordinary by child? Hello, I (w32) have been busy with something for a long time. I am very disciplined and organized at work, (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but I have been struggling all my life to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases where everything comes to a standstill, and then occasionally it hits me and I clean up. But it's never really "that someone could suddenly drop by for a visit". My husband (unfortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere but mostly the household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child? We haven't gotten one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupying me for a while.
For me, I don't have any motivation to clean, it simply doesn't bother me as long as no visitors come and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable. Do you have more motivation with children or do you remain slovenly? I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut offers a maximum of comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-shaping with special, further engraving at the joints for improved mobility (at arm and knee bends) For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends) High-quality pre-shaping in the lower back area and in the thighs ensure a close-fitting, perfect seat. Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back zip and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection. When positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2mm) sealing at the face on the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet). A soft, adjustable zone in the collar improves sealing with a fine, adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop fastener that does not adhere to the coating or seams. Double cuffs with zipper at arm and ankle joints connect a detachable inner cuff with a soft, coated neoprene outer cuff.
45° Curl at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when pulling on. Long zipper at the nape with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without hood. Long G-Lock back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Sleeve closures on arms and legs Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the sleeve closures to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels tightly bonded with outer and inner overlapping.
The edges of the outer strap are reinforced for greater durability, while the edges of the inner straps are curved for increased flexibility. The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wristwatch computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder? I have completed an education in software development and have been on a break for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPS). This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe I have improved in this regard).
Can I become a social worker like that? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support. However, I don't know if the concrete work routine is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find information about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("again, the simplest things are messed up") and it is hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do this"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"he must think I'm really underprivileged" etc.). I will probably have these problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
But you have already returned the sofa, right? Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment. What do you mean by "return"?
When I download a book from #PRS\_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS\_ORG# authorizes this book, but there are problems" appears.
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken with the feed (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up its own protein substances from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism. Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as this can otherwise lead to disruptions in the breeding process.
After the brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement). The bird breaks down the protein (protein) it has taken in through its feed in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up its own protein substances from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather renewal in moulting birds are extremely complex processes that are closely linked to the overall organism of the animal with a particularly high demand.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the breeding process. After the short-term use of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed. 1 g NEKTON-Bio should be mixed with 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft feed.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily. A level measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the approach of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and I attached pictures. Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community member in conflict with the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled. A request for felling has been submitted to the municipality. An employee has informed me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
In the bylaws, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree. Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not? On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear. Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message, well, I still have a sofa that is unused. Could you then offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I believe that's possible. The question is, can I pay in euros and have the cover shipped to Germany? Can you check on that?
Urgent message: Serious traffic accident on St 2179 between Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg has occurred recently. As the police press alarm currently reports (14:03), a car has crashed into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand. Alright, thank you very much again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life. First of all, happy Christmas to you! My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good, because my dear head is currently dismantling everything that can be dismantled.
Before I dig in here... briefly: I need advice, preferably from people who are somehow familiar with my situation - that is, from you. I am currently doing the Ref as a career changer. Originally, I studied something else and worked in a related field (to remain at least somewhat anonymous, I won't mention anything specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me. At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that it was the right choice, even though the framework conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me. I am now on my third "I google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year. Before I started painting, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the Ref, but now I'm absolutely done.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me. Before the exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my leisure time was my leisure time.
At that time, I was free. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now, even the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that drive me crazy. Overall, it's fun and from an outside perspective, things are going well in terms of feedback and so on. But I'm completely exhausted and I'm wondering how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it's not already doing so.
I'm asking myself if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, found the work a bit boring but was appropriately paid and worked together as a team rather than being a lone fighter like most of the time now. But then I ask myself if I won't be in the same situation in a year's time and be unhappy. You can see, it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps as outsiders you have ideas or suggestions on how I can get out of this situation that I'm completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions at the moment, as I am feeling quite emotional, which is likely to lead to nothing good. But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand-new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Even these amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits, because they simply do a better job of capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for here. All guitarists dream of the warmth and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit with a 12AX7 tube in every VT+ amplifier embodies the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers. The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable hook-and-loop fasteners, it adapts completely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses. A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three additional lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLR cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2 still have room for more lenses. You can also store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLR camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and photography-related items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday. So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists dare not make any predictions about when it will end. The indicators point to a slowdown. The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions In just under three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros. Two new land masses of about 50 hectares each were formed offshore due to cooled lava.
Particularly affected was the banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption. 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were severely affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts Christmas is at the door, especially the children are hardly able to wait for the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something tempting about them.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-promoting "social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition, as it did with St. Nicholas becoming the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated the Christmas holidays with gift-giving. Before that, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in some way. The background of this still popular custom is that St. Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular German custom of filling children's shoes with gifts. Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "saint worship." For this reason, they distance themselves from the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition. The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, since most Protestants no longer see such details as so important, it only bothers a few that the tradition of St. Nicholas is still firmly part of the pre-Christmas season, much like the Martin tradition with Martin's singing and Martin's procession.
Today, one can find everything one's heart desires, from socks to coveted luxury watches, in front of the door in boots and under the Christmas tree. The diversity of traditions in Christian countries confirms a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who now brings gifts to children. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas with some characteristics assigned to him over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Christ Child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought some fame. Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sled as a troika. In Czechia, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, it is the Christ Child who is responsible for delivering the gifts.
I have been receiving this error message for 3 weeks when trying to download a new book, but my account and contact details are up to date. Please help with troubleshooting, as otherwise I will purchase a different e-book from #PRS\_ORG#.
I have requested a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning. I was told that one would be sent to me. However, I have not received it yet (not in the spam folder either), so I would like to inquire now about how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near King's Palace In the vicinity of Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday. The police reported that callers had reported a man with a weapon who had allegedly gone into a bank and a bookmaker's shop.
The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle which was later stopped by officials. Shots were fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not operate on the basis of a terrorist background. In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace, there are several embassies located. The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area, or stone garden. The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes. Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum brightness duration of 10 hours - The robust plastic execution is suitable for outdoor use all year round. In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that glow internally in color.
"Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in a total of six different color tones). The rounded, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day. Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether at the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He does well in the neighborhood of larger gravel and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size. You can save yourself a lot of hard work: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light. Simply set the "Light Stone" in a sunny spot during the day.
Two delivered stakes ensure a firm grip when needed. The matte white plastic cover is robust and weather-resistant. Its solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.

It eventually turns off automatically when the battery charge reaches a predetermined minimum or it gets lighter again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day.
I have already done that several times, but it doesn't work.
Regrettably, I would have liked to place another order with you, but if the discount is not credited to me, I will not place any more orders out of principle. If you decide otherwise, please let me know. Otherwise, this will be the last contact today.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again. A variable, adjustable PWM frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures particularly quiet operation, especially with bell armature motors - the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past. The load regulation can now be adjusted with up to 10 CVs to suit even difficult cases.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor. The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough for older motors. Please use the Ebay shopping cart so that the shipping costs are calculated correctly.

Pill problem  Hello dear ladies, I hope I'm doing this right. Is this really my first post after a year on Reddit?
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly severe pain during my period and premenstrual syndrome before my period. Now I would like to stop taking it again, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an approximately two-year break, during which I went from 0 to 100 acne-wise and had them all over the place. So far so superficial, but it bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel well. Over the course of the two-year break, the whole thing never really normalized.
Perhaps someone has some tips to avoid this. My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and quiet, but maybe someone can recommend something to me. Unfortunately, my gynecologist did not take me seriously, and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, the skin is such a thing. I had severe neurodermatitis before puberty, then a period of rest, then widespread acne and knotty skin.
I have also tried everything imaginable in terms of nutrition during my Christian illness and have ended up sticking to a sugar, milk, and meat-free mixed diet because nothing else has worked so well. It may also be good that hormonally, the worm is simply inside, but when you, like me, have construction sites everywhere, you want to stop searching for what else might be going wrong.
I had already written everything to her colleague (seminar, etc.) and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was answered about my matter. I have to keep working and answering the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What should I check if the money was there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgments in everyday clothing in the courtroom. But a lot depends on their verdict, even if they don't wear a robe: jurors, along with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately I am unable to access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have the means to store it for so long. We would use the table, as offered by them, as if it were ours.
Sure, I'd be happy to help. Here's the translation:  "Gerne, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful now, I would like to order one in gray."
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
A new 110 kV underground cable will be built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding. The government of Lower Bavaria's planning approval decision clears the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now announced this. The approximately seven-kilometer-long underground cable will connect the transformer substation Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected near the Edermanning village near Reut to a mast of the overhead line.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially with us so far. The blue Betsellnummer:#PRS\_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me what the next step is? Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained it several times yesterday! This is a glass commode and all the sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged. The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Subject: Lesson Planning (EK)  Hello dear colleagues,  I have been in the Ref since the summer and I enjoy teaching, but I am currently having major problems with time-efficiently planning my lessons in the subject of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not at all well-equipped technically, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media. In addition, I can only print in black and white for free at school (which is annoying for geography). I currently need a very long time to plan my lessons.
We are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself. In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I do not want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I always start with the learning goal in mind (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually, I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school does not have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the exercises in the book. Therefore also the worksheets. Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really enjoy it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. I have actually already decided to go for a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears the 2G regulation for the Christmas business. In most stores, only those who are vaccinated or recovered may enter. The trade considers this unnecessary and laments revenue declines.
A possible solution is also at hand. The 2G regulations, in the opinion of the German Retail Association (HDE), are ruining the important Christmas business for retail. Sales declines are to be regretted, criticized HDE CEO Stefan Genth, when it comes to articles of non-daily need.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies look negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many have already written off the Christmas business. "What is supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week. Only the food retail trade and the online sector are doing well. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO. "2G during shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations deterred customers and required a high personnel effort.
The "band system" must be approved nationwide, he demanded. According to this, each customer would only have to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the received band that day. In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested).
Even the real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop, specializing in shopping centers, spoke of difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent. These numbers will now certainly fall in the middle of such an important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers. This includes the so-called "wristband solution," where "visitors, for example, can present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a hotel club, enter all stores unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler. It looks unappealing.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it. How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp. In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very high luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker. The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large surfaces at relatively short distances, is excellent. By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To adjust the settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons. The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for the use of cost-effective NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also check the batteries' power output before the set - it has a built-in battery tester for each of the two battery compartments, with a value displayed in the two display screens (the left battery in the upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the flashlight with current through the included power supply. The construction of the flashlight is very simple. You have a 16mm threaded sleeve for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably set using sensors on both sides. Attention was paid to the fact that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy use. Additionally, a tilting joint is included in the delivery range.
It is great that a bag is also included in the delivery scope, so you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might still want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small 🙁
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring-packed comeback against Leverkusen What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt. After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had not won in their last two games, seemed to be on their way to another Bundesliga defeat.
But then the SGE turned around, shook off the frustration of a mediocre start to the season within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and gave a "general praise" to "everyone who was involved." At first, it looked like another disappointment for the Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach. "How the players then came back and put on a fantastic performance," said Glasner further. I am incredibly happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcoming his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I believe our mentality is incredible," said the 27-year-old, looking forward to the result especially for the spectators. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner will now keep the focus within himself, but he also feels well-prepared in terms of the personnel situation. It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition. It is top work in our medical department, but also the players are living highly professionally.
Now, one wants to "go step by step and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year at this level. Next up, on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (6:30 pm, Sky).
I received the email that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# to have it redirected, but there was no chance. Can it be resent directly to me or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is cancelled?
It would unfortunately mean for me that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Valve for women's handball team before quarterfinals against Spain  Germany's women's handball team is sneaking off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark. At the end of the main round of the World Cup, the DHB team suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," coach Henk Groener judged. Against Spain, we have to act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in Group III of the main round with 8:2 points behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't carry the flow with us. That was a poor performance by all of us that we need to erase, said Captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a clear improvement is needed against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup on the coming Tuesday to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion from Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted midfielder Xenia Smits and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now." Not up to par from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top of their game from the start. Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after just seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately up to speed and prevented worse with a few saves.
The first goal was scored by the German team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack. However, this was not the hoped-for spark. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team's goal.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since midfielder Mia Zschocke saw red later due to a hard foul on her opponent. However, she will be allowed to participate in the quarterfinals. Only in the final phase of the first half did the German national team improve their performance and manage to score five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the change was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19. The Greens' protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is considered a medal contender at the final, to win. As a result, the German team could not recover and left the court as clear losers.
ROOF-Advent calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have secured the St. Nicholas Day and use this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions during the pre-Christmas period, St. Nicholas Day, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays. How was it at your house back then?
How about at your\*r partner's\* place? Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is the most beautiful thing for the children?
Boot cleaning? Cookies baking? Tree decorating?
Is music being played? Does Santa Claus or the Christ Child come, or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa? It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort to have a beautiful family celebration around Christmas.
Whether these are now established traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help with the confirmation of the transfer... etc.
I would like to redeem a discount code, as it works with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers. Does this work there as well?
The title exists before, I am working as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these will soon be largely completed, it will then continue in part in vaccination centers for me. I would be happy to answer questions without any time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination...").
My area of responsibility includes providing information about vaccination, determining the indication (a person has a right to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and no reasons to the contrary), medical documentation, and, if necessary, providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical staff. However, in vaccination teams, we often do not have any, but rather (thankfully, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for preparing the vaccine, who cannot (are not allowed to?) perform vaccinations, so I also carry out most vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution  What is a "Huidlerer"? This dialect word, sent in by an Amberger, has caused heated thinking in the BR television program "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unmentioned in the "Host mi?" series by the callers this time. No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And neither was it someone who "has to go fast".
That, heard the people from the TV moderator, is completely wrong. Whereupon the man from Amberg provided the solution and thus probably also surprised many people from Upper Palatinate. "The Huidlerer", the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialect researcher Anthony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian television for years, confirmed this. With the remark that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern". Thus, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for two weeks now. After the confirmation, I always get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later. I have tried restarting the #PRS\_ORG#, connecting to the PC, synchronizing, and repairing.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bike - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of motivation to prepare for my bicycle tour next week by at least a little training. Well, I said and did it, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then something happened that lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you, Krefeld!). Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the journey on any account.
Since I couldn't get a replacement tire and tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around half-heartedly and take the first train back home. It wasn't technically that bad, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike ride. But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would really rather not have this problem more often. Now it wasn't too bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who rode 120km on them until 2pm on the day I picked up the bike) were also suboptimal, as he had been riding on them for several years. But if I think about the fact that I have to change the tire after 80-90km of riding, I am really in a bad mood :D
Now I have struck up a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be indestructible. Of course, this all sounds very tempting now. But are they really unbreakable?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end. Furthermore, I am asking myself: I currently have on my racing bike, I believe, 25x622. This is also available (apparently?) in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend me to other tires for a racing bike? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! My layman's knowledge rather leans towards recommending the Durano DD.
Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured  The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten when his car collided with a traffic island for unknown reasons and then veered onto the oncoming lane, according to police.

Hello everyone,  We are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year! Unfortunately, due to well-known reasons, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per shift, so we will be streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow along! We're doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30. Start cooling your drinks, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
