觉得很有意义的一本证书——急救证这是我除了驾驶证之外一本觉得重要的技能证书之一！普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。

ASSISTANT: A very meaningful certificate - the First Aid Certificate is one of the important skill certificates, besides the driver's license, that I think is valuable! Let me explain: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken in case of sudden events, that is, pre-hospital emergency treatment before the ambulance arrives.

众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。这个时候便是需要急救的时候。如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！

ASSISTANT: As is well known, the process of an ambulance arriving after an accident takes some time, and it is precisely during this time that it is most critical. This is the time when emergency care is needed. If I were to really experience a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then my window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!

所以身边的人懂得急救是多么重要呀！当我们身边有人倒下的时候，我们可以通过专业的知识去对他进行抢救，而不是傻傻地站在那里一动不动什么也做不了，这种无助的感觉太让人感到可怕了。“在中国，我们官方数据每年有三百万人意外死亡，最危险的叫心脏骤停。

ASSISTANT: Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid! When someone nearby collapses, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly, unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too frightening. "In China, we have official data that three hundred thousand people die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous is heart attack."

ASSISTANT: If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing, has no pulse, performing CPR on them is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to potentially save their life. I have found that few people have the awareness to learn first aid, but when an emergency arises, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.

重庆中职学校试点现代学徒制 入学即是企业准员工-新华网昨天，记者从市教委获悉，今年起，我市将在60所中职学校试点“现代学徒制”人才培养模式，接受试点培养的学生同时具备学徒身份，招生录入后将被试点企业预录为单位员工。市教委要求，规范中职学校招生录取和企业用工程序，明确学徒的中职学校学生和企业准员工双重身份，按照双向选择原则，学徒、学校和企业签订三方协议，对于年满16周岁未达到18周岁的学徒，须由学徒、监护人、学校和企业四方签订协议，确定各方权益及学徒在岗培养的具体岗位、教学内容、权益保障等。

ASSISTANT: Chongqing to pilot modern apprentice system in 60 vocational schools - Xinhua News Agency

According to a report from the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, from this year onwards, Chongqing will pilot a "modern apprentice system" talent cultivation model in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted into these schools will have the status of both students and apprentices. After being recruited and registered, they will be pre-employed as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.

The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises be standardized. The dual identity of apprentices as both vocational school students and enterprise pre-employees should be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, a tripartite agreement should be signed by the apprentices, schools, and enterprises. For apprentices who are under 16 years old but have not yet reached 18 years old, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to

In enterprise practice, the enterprise-based management mode should be implemented according to the characteristics of different professions. One mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational position. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city designated 60 municipal vocational middle-level modern apprenticeship pilot sites in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot site, and a total of about 3,000 apprentices (students) to be trained.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。

ASSISTANT: South African doctor: Although the transmission power of Omicron is strong, most cases are mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng province of South Africa has reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.

ASSISTANT: He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the patients he treated for COVID-19 had "breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels.

ASSISTANT: Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence have provided some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate among early cases in South Africa reached 20%.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。

ASSISTANT: I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively cheap practice racket first. However, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the friendliness. If you can't distinguish between the two, it's normal for the more expensive racket to be more friendly than the cheaper one. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the racket, it vibrates a lot, and the hard ball can't stay on it. Even professionals find it difficult to control it.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

ASSISTANT: Their logic and underlying words are - tennis is so difficult, you won't be able to learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so I'll cheat you with a cheap one. You'll play twice and never play again, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad. When you can really distinguish good from bad, it means you have progressed, and then you can come back here to buy the expensive ones. I'll make two times the money. I suggest spending the same amount of money on a slightly better used racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets won't sell for high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 is fine, and a used one for 200 is even better. Isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a thousand-dollar racket for only 200 bucks?

江西３年内将培训万名乡村小学音体美教师-新华网新华社南昌５月２２日电（记者陈毓珊）记者近日从江西省教育厅获悉，为增强紧缺学科教师队伍保障能力，实现乡村义务教育均衡发展，自２０１６年起，江西省规划用３年时间为全省乡村（乡镇及以下）每所小学培训合格的音乐、美术、体育教师各１名，共计１万名。据了解，这次培训对象为江西全省乡村小学４５岁以下具有音乐、美术、体育学科知识基础或才能，能兼任音乐、美术、体育课程的其他学科教师。

ASSISTANT: In the next three years, Jiangxi will train 10,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for rural primary schools. According to a report from the Jiangxi Education Department, in order to strengthen the shortage of teachers in these subjects and achieve balanced development in rural compulsory education, the province has planned to provide training for one music, art, and physical education teacher each for every rural primary school (township and below) starting from 2016. The training is open to primary school teachers in Jiangxi who are under the age of 45 and have a basic knowledge or talent in music, art, or physical education and can also teach other subjects.

通过培训，使他们掌握音体美学科教学的基本知识和教学技能，更新教学思想和观念，掌握现代教学方法，提高学科教学能力、活动设计能力、校园文化能力及自我发展能力，建设一支一专多能的音体美教师队伍，缓解乡村音体美教师缺乏的问题。为确保培训质量和效果，江西还规划为全省１００个县（市、区）小学音乐、美术、体育各培训１名，共计３００名培训者，全面提升他们的教学示范引领能力、教研活动设计组织能力、施训能力、网络研修工作坊建设能力，起到教授、示范、指导、监督的作用。

ASSISTANT: Through training, we aim to equip them with basic knowledge and teaching skills in the field of aesthetics education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their ability to teach the subject, design activities, and cultivate campus culture, as well as their ability for self-development. By building a team of teachers who are proficient in multiple areas, we hope to alleviate the problem of a shortage of aesthetics teachers in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to provide training for 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, with one trainee each for music, art, and physical education in each county, for a total of 300 trainees. The training will comprehensively enhance their ability to demonstrate teaching, lead research activities, conduct training, organize online research workshops, and serve as a teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising role.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。

ASSISTANT: Actually, there are many requirements for clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls who are overweight, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long. It should be around the knee, just covering the fat on the thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.

过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。

ASSISTANT: Clothes that are too long can give people a feeling of being short and plump. If you divide them into three sections of top, middle, and bottom, it will seem like you have naturally grown taller. For example, wearing a top, skirt, and long socks in different colors can create a sense of being tall. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the signature style of plump girls (the author deeply understands this point), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal a plump body. High-class and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice of plump girls.

穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。

ASSISTANT: Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make you look slimmer. If you have thick legs, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable. The more popular the style, the better. The color should not be too eye-catching.

以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and getting the impression that you are overweight, it's important to share some tips on how to dress for girls who are slightly overweight. Girls who are slightly overweight should not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and tops should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which can make you look uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, it's best to wear black tights or grid tights (the kind with fine patterns), and choose soft and delicate floral print skirts, paired with a blouse with a lapel collar. This can effectively cover up the shortcomings of overweight girls.

当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔!

ASSISTANT: Of course, when chubby girls wear short skirts, they also have to be particular about it. Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of the skirt, which can make your figure look taller. Pairing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN combination for the summer!

ASSISTANT: If you are an MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, I recommend choosing a short dress with a sense of luxury. Not only can it cover your belly skin, but it can also showcase your advantages. An A-style short dress will look slimming, which is more suitable for chubby girls.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。

ASSISTANT: Asian American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a joint complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on the 23rd, protesting against discrimination against Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three top schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called "holistic review" admission process, systematically and continuously. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the admission rate of Asians relative to the total number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。

ASSISTANT: Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhu Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in admissions. They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.

目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

ASSISTANT: Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's complaint also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yushan Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and transferred 200,000 yuan to the seller's bank account as a deposit. Lin signed on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the recipient, stating that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week."

然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: However, due to disagreements on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory for sale and payment methods, the property sale contract has not been signed for a long time. Considering that both parties have failed to reach an agreement on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu. The house that was carefully selected, the deposit was paid, and the down payment was also ready, just waiting to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。一审判决后，原告提起上诉。

ASSISTANT: For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yongjia City People's Court. After the court conducted a trial, it determined that both parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to solely blame the defendant. Therefore, the case should not apply the penalty of double the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the liability of breaching the contract by paying double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.

近日，二审法院维持原判。【律师提醒】 在交易过程中要尽到必要的审慎注意义务。在签订合同时，作为买方要尽到必要的审慎注意义务，比如，核实房屋所有权人信息、房屋是否被人占用等相关信息，并在合同中明确关于交付的具体时间、地点，以防履行合同时双方产生争议。

ASSISTANT: Recently, the Second Circuit Court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence in the transaction process. As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence in verifying information such as the ownership of the property, whether the property is currently occupied, and other relevant information when signing the contract. It is also important to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。

ASSISTANT: 1,100 newborns in Sabah without birth certificates due to counterfeit paper shortage (Kota Kinabalu, November 11) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper running out, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, with a total of 1,100 affected so far. However, the department's director, Kamaruzaman Abu Kassim, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the counterfeit-proof paper arrives next week.

ASSISTANT: He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from that of other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' inventory. Keryl Amynius revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work. "The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week, and the final stage of printing will be carried out immediately upon returning to Sabah.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。

ASSISTANT: The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism has issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control at ports of entry. It stipulates that those who have recently left land border ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) must provide proof of a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and those entering land border ports of entry must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The notice states that this requirement will be in effect from the date of announcement of the port of entry cities by each province, district, and municipality until March 15, 2022.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the notice proposes that cities with ports that meet certain conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. A relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support, and frequent exchanges occur between the two sides of the border. By implementing differentiated management policies, a single line of epidemic prevention and control can become two lines, which is expected to achieve pre-border control, compress the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。

ASSISTANT: Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported through ports of entry in cities. The aforementioned notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, inadequate implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of the entire cold chain, inadequate management of quarantine sites, and inadequate scientific and precise handling of epidemic emergencies. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to fill the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control work in port cities, without any relaxation, and to do the work of epidemic prevention and control in a scientific and precise manner, and to tighten the external defense line to prevent the importation of the epidemic.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the work of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihoods, publish and publicize the hotline for people's livelihood protection, and regularly investigate and address potential risks in areas such as the supply and price of basic necessities of life. According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include those with land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, cities, leagues), and directly-administered municipalities, with the specific scope determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

ASSISTANT: This film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan War under the pretext of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, resulting in 20 years of impoverished soldiers, bloodthirsty nature, and indiscriminate killings, committing various anti-human atrocities.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。

ASSISTANT: Don't intimidate people at the starting line. When browsing bookstores, one can often feel the heat of success books. Many of the popular success books today preach the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do "is what."
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。

ASSISTANT: Equating it to saying that the "how to do it" is the most important and fundamental link. Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are full of enthusiasm and do their best, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just wait in place. This "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people are intimidated before the starting line.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。

ASSISTANT: Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make up your mind, remake yourself, and undergo a 180-degree great turnaround," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who adhere to the status quo, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you should shout "you must transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the fool. Almost all people will feel fear and hesitation before the word "transformation," taking small steps and finding it hard to make a decision; or they may make a sudden decision to transform and take the first step boldly, but it often doesn't last long, and they fall back soon, and it's hard to see any continuity.

马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "Starting from Tomorrow" dialogue most vividly demonstrated this "universal human nature" classic. The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the entry threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, leaving the vast majority of people feeling frustrated and disappointed. Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a possible path for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。

ASSISTANT: The core principle of "the next best thing" is to "lower the bar" - it encourages a "small wins lead to big wins" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dunes in front of your home is also fine, because that is still better than staying in the same place. Overall, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing. With the bar significantly lowered, it creates the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres, the chances of success will increase.

只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: Following the "second-best principle" path to success may be a slightly longer journey, but overall, the "best principle" may raise the banner of making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can only motivate a few. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。

ASSISTANT: The naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 710 tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results obtained by journalists from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department. The total storage capacity of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has reached 108.5 thousand tons, increasing by more than 40 times compared to the protected initial period in 2002. Naked carp is a valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: During the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, the Tibetan antelope population in the Qinghai Lake area was severely reduced due to factors such as large-scale hunting, degradation of breeding habitats, and environmental deterioration. By 2002, the total storage of Tibetan antelope resources in Qinghai Lake had decreased to only 2,592 tons. In 2004, the Tibetan antelope was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any units, groups, or individuals from fishing for Tibetan antelopes or selling them or their products.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。

ASSISTANT: Meanwhile, through measures such as artificial breeding and release and the cleaning of the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passageways," the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has continued to increase annually. Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department Deputy Director Yang Lin introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 billion naked carp have been artificially bred and released in Qinghai Lake, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources. The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water source recharge area not only in China but also in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.

ASSISTANT: In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the Qinghai Lake water area, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, establishing a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。

ASSISTANT: Taking a foot bath and feeling a tingling sensation in your feet, is it due to electric leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the increase in people's awareness of health, foot baths are becoming more and more popular, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice.

在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。

ASSISTANT: In related data tables, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-related household appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. "It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking in the bathtub.

李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a pen, and the pen surprisingly lit up. Mr. Li discovered that there was electricity in the water of the foot bath. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although the foot bath was returned. Mr. Li still felt unsatisfied.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。

ASSISTANT: Because he found that this popular bathtub for a long time has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular bathtub.

第十三届省茶博会开幕 - 视点头条 - 湖南日报网 - 华声在线湖南日报12月10日讯（全媒体记者 张尚武 胡盼盼 通讯员 刘晓玲 摄影 李健）今天上午，第十三届湖南茶业博览会暨新化红茶推介会在湖南国际会展中心举行，展示茶产业，创新茶科技，弘扬茶文化，加快冲刺千亿茶产业目标。中华全国供销合作总社理事会副主任侯顺利、省人大常委会副主任叶红专出席开幕式。

ASSISTANT: The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily - Hunan Voice Online December 10 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Chaoyu, Hu Qianqian, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Changhe Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a billion-ton tea industry. Vice Chairman of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Association, Hou Shunli, and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

中国工程院院士刘仲华教授在开幕式上隆重推介：湖红之源在新化，红茶崛起为“五彩湘茶”注入新动力。近年来，省委、省政府大力支持茶产业发展，推进千亿湘茶产业建设，形成“三湘四水五彩茶”的发展格局。省内茶界加大创新，绿茶、黑茶、红茶等主力茶类轮番发力，主产茶区推进茶旅融合，带动广大茶农增收。

ASSISTANT: Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, grandly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhui, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into the "Five-color Tea of Xiang". In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the thousand-billion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters, Five-color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert force, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving large-scale tea farmers to increase income.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

风水轮流转，红茶又发力。省内茶界专家称，采完绿茶采红茶、黑茶，茶农一年四季有收入，茶园产值直线上升。在开幕式上，省领导为第四批获权使用“湖南红茶”商标的企业进行授牌，新化喜捧“湖红之源 ” 。

ASSISTANT: The wind water turns alternately, and red tea exerts its strength again. According to tea experts in the industry, after harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens increases linearly. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leader awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and new changes welcomed the "Lake Red Source".
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在新化红茶展馆，福建茶商看中一款名为“冰里春”的高山茶，当即下订单。省茶业协会秘书长王准高兴地说，当前疫情等因素或多或少影响茶叶市场，但从茶博会现场看，亮点纷呈。新化红茶一抹红，注入了茶文化内涵，人气旺、交易火，湘茶产业喜迎新的春天。

ASSISTANT: In the Xinhuai Tea Exhibition Hall, a tea merchant from Fujian was attracted by a type of tea called "Ice in Spring" and placed an order on the spot. The secretary-general of the provincial tea industry association, Wang Jun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea leaf market, but from the tea expo site, it can be seen that there are many highlights. The Xinhuai red tea has a touch of red, injecting cultural connotations into tea, and the popularity and trading are booming. The tea industry in Hunan is welcoming a new spring.

Firstly, you should look at the institution's teacher strength, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions may not have particularly strong teacher strength.

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before selecting a training institution, it is best to inquire about the institution's students. After all, only the students of the institution know how good or bad the courses taught by the institution are. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because you have not introduced your own situation. Learning this thing is closely related to your personal situation. For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you want to learn or engage in.

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

ASSISTANT: If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has graduated, in my personal opinion, if you have enough time, I recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also quite good, but the learning cost is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. However, if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili for more training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through introduction to obtain free resources, or for detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining videos.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but can pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, I suggest going to a training institution to learn. This way, learning doesn't have to be very tiring, and the teachers explain in detail. If you have any questions, there are people specially assigned to answer them. Moreover, in terms of learning planning or supervision, it is also helpful. In addition, many training institutions now sign employment contracts, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after studying, which can save a lot of trouble in the job interview stage. Above are my views, and I briefly introduced them before because I didn't know your situation. If you have any other questions you want to consult, feel free to contact me for communication and exchange.

据策展团队介绍，本次双年展的主题为“摸着石头过河 ” ， 隐喻社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当下境遇。本次双年展占地近12000平方米，展厅横跨六个相互连接的建筑，以六个单元呈现 ： 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 。其中，27位沙特艺术家的作品数量占本次展品总量的四成以上，囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品同样备受关注，有的艺术家以新颖的方式使用回收材料进行创作，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图 》 （ 2014）中，用废弃物重构了一幅经典山水画。

ASSISTANT: According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this year's biennial exhibition is "Feeling for Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and reflects the current state of cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Feeling for Stones to Cross the River", "Experiment as Inheritance", "Borderline Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create works using recycled materials, such as Xue Huan's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Stream of Qiyun Mountain" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using waste

ASSISTANT: The chief executive of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakri, stated that he hopes this year's biennale can establish international dialogue and allow global audiences to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative communities, enhancing interaction and communication. Tan Feiyu said, "The goal of the biennale is dual. On the one hand, it aims to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation, and on the other hand, it aims to immerse Saudi audiences in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, where artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the art and creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Regulate and Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) To continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken populations, to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently launched policies to promote the regulation and standardization of the management of public welfare posts in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. According to the relevant responsible person of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts, which are used for the employment of poverty-stricken labor and other rural disadvantaged groups, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken people achieve employment income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

ASSISTANT: This regulation was jointly issued by the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Rural Revitalization, the Ministry of Finance, and five other departments. It mainly standardizes the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, post development, post management, and other aspects. In terms of post development, the regulation clearly stipulates that it should be developed according to the principles of "post-based recruitment, post-based appointment, dynamic management, and quota control", "who develops the post, who uses it, and who is responsible for it", and "one person, one post, voluntary public recruitment, and unified management". The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public notice, appointment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the departments mainly responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for the subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the departments in charge of rural public welfare positions to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel in those positions. It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

ASSISTANT: II. Although the rightists had a period of being resolute in history, it was not long-lasting. This is because a little bit of sunshine can make things flourish, and a sip of water can make one sweat. As soon as they have a little bit of ambition, they look towards Shu (a region in western China), but as soon as they are struck, they fall to the ground. However, when it comes to the matter of facts, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. From defining the standard of truth during the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and technological advancement, to promoting the institutionalization of government and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: Three: As for me, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he has to say, and I respect him as a person. He is sincere, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, a chaotic political situation, and foreign powers taking advantage of the situation.

ASSISTANT: Let's talk about the left again. The left is actually a bunch of orphans of history and politics. If we say that the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when needed. But the left doesn't have this advantage, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!

五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

ASSISTANT: Recently, I have seen some friends mocking both thieves and leftists, and they seem to have a lot of energy. I think it's not necessary at all. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both a bunch of nonsense that can't be reasoned with.

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the anti-thief curses you for five yuan, and when the leftist curses you for being a rightist, it just proves that the middle path we are taking is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but forgot about them as they grew older, or pursued their ideals but ended up becoming obsessed. As they drifted further and further away from their ideals, even the once-noble young dragon could eventually become a wicked dragon.

ASSISTANT: I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom, and historically and culturally, China has a tendency towards the left. Domestically, the right emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left focuses on regulation and fairness. Currently, society as a whole tends to prioritize fairness, and with the competition between China and the US, being left-leaning is certain to continue for many years to come.

ASSISTANT: Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration Address: Huan Cheng Nan Lu 156 Hao Xing Fu Yuan 12 Floor

It all started with a friend's introduction because of trust. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: As soon as I arrived at the store, a series of scams began. This was my first time there, and I only showed them my house plan. They didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote and say that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't even know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that once you came to the store, they would drag you into paying the deposit (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, they can give you how much discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan deposit. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom was not included. These three are the basic costs.

ASSISTANT: Regardless of how it happens, biting to death is always the customer's problem, and they are completely blameless. There are all sorts of shifting of responsibility, as well as many details, and I don't want to go into them all; it's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend found that the house they decorated was of poor quality, and they charged all sorts of fees in the end.
