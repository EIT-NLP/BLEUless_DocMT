Sure, no problem.
A very meaningful certificate - the First Aid Certificate is one of the important skill certificates, besides the driver's license, that I think is valuable! Let me explain: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken in case of sudden events, that is, pre-hospital emergency treatment before the ambulance arrives.
As is well known, the process of an ambulance arriving after an accident takes some time, and it is precisely during this time that it is most critical. This is the time when emergency care is needed. If I were to really experience a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then my window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid! When someone nearby collapses, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly, unable to do anything. This feeling of helplessness is too frightening. "In China, we have official data that three hundred thousand people die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous is heart attack."
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved. In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing, it is less than 1%. This was the first reaction of the founder Lu Le.
If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing, has no pulse, performing CPR on them is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to potentially save their life. I have found that few people have the awareness to learn first aid, but when an emergency arises, it's too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
It's possible that it could save a person's life! You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to accomplish before turning 25, and adding the first aid certification to my goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certifications that I'm interested in. I'm planning to take a scuba diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a scuba diving first aid certification. It seems like you need to have a first aid certification to take the scuba diving certification, so actually, the first aid certification is quite useful!

Chongqing to pilot modern apprentice system in 60 vocational schools - Xinhua News Agency  According to a report from the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, from this year onwards, Chongqing will pilot a "modern apprentice system" talent cultivation model in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted into these schools will have the status of both students and apprentices. After being recruited and registered, they will be pre-employed as unit employees by the pilot enterprises.  The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment procedures for vocational schools and enterprises be standardized. The dual identity of apprentices as both vocational school students and enterprise pre-employees should be clearly defined. According to the principle of mutual selection, a tripartite agreement should be signed by the apprentices, schools, and enterprises. For apprentices who are under 16 years old but have not yet reached 18 years old, a quadripartite agreement must be signed by the apprentice, guardian, school, and enterprise to
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship formats and jointly conduct on-the-job training and transfer training with collaborative enterprises. Pilot schools need to reform talent cultivation models. Schools and enterprises should jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Take the cultivation of the educational system as a pilot period, the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the talent cultivation plan, and the peak internship generally lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, the enterprise-based management mode should be implemented according to the characteristics of different professions. One mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotational position. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city designated 60 municipal vocational middle-level modern apprenticeship pilot sites in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot site, and a total of about 3,000 apprentices (students) to be trained.
According to the principle of piloting first and then rolling out, gradually advancing from points to areas, we explore the establishment of long-term mechanisms for joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation between schools and enterprises, in order to effectively improve students' job skills, increase their employment rate and improve the quality of employment.

South African doctor: Although the transmission power of Omicron is strong, most cases are mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng province of South Africa has reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization. Pillay said, "They are able to control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He added that this includes elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions, who are more susceptible to severe illness from COVID-19.
He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta epidemic, the patients he treated for COVID-19 had "breathing difficulties and low oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence have provided some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate among early cases in South Africa reached 20%. William Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, quoted data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all the signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "Currently, we are still in the early stage, and we need to obtain data from the later stage. Generally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still one of the major COVID-19 strains worldwide, Omicron cases are now appearing in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak. According to health officials, the province of Gauteng in South Africa reported a 400% increase in new cases in the first week of December, and tests show that over 90% of the cases are the Omicron variant.

Actually, I don't know if it was a mistake by the store or the courier. The package didn't have a receipt, so I can't trace it.
I hope you understand
Because the delivery time displayed is faster by 30 minutes than the actual delivery time, thank you.
Yes, I have changed drivers. The restaurant has been saying they are processing it for a long time.
I have waited for several hours.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
It turns out that I didn't call for #NUMBER# after all.
If you don't eat, I will definitely complain that you can't send it. Why don't you tell me earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
No, I haven't received the call. Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.
I have been waiting for a meal for an hour and a half, but it still hasn't been delivered. I want to cancel the order.
Why not cancel it?
Hello, the live chicken delivered by the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively cheap practice racket first. However, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the friendliness. If you can't distinguish between the two, it's normal for the more expensive racket to be more friendly than the cheaper one. These "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste. They have very low strength, and when the ball hits the racket, it vibrates a lot, and the hard ball can't stay on it. Even professionals find it difficult to control it.
Their logic and underlying words are - tennis is so difficult, you won't be able to learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so I'll cheat you with a cheap one. You'll play twice and never play again, so this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad. When you can really distinguish good from bad, it means you have progressed, and then you can come back here to buy the expensive ones. I'll make two times the money. I suggest spending the same amount of money on a slightly better used racket. Choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not famous enough, so good rackets won't sell for high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 is fine, and a used one for 200 is even better. Isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of a thousand-dollar racket for only 200 bucks?
The text can be translated to English as follows:  "It's quite friendly to newcomers, but once you pass the newcomer stage, it's a pain in the neck. However, most people, especially women, can't get past the newcomer stage."
May I ask for your help in following up on the order as the delivery time has been repeatedly delayed? Can you provide an updated estimated delivery date? Thank you.
Thank you
That is to say, I already have credit, right?
Next, do I need to place another order? Can I ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but there were many things missing in the food that was delivered, and the chicken was also raw.

In the next three years, Jiangxi will train 10,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for rural primary schools. According to a report from the Jiangxi Education Department, in order to strengthen the shortage of teachers in these subjects and achieve balanced development in rural compulsory education, the province has planned to provide training for one music, art, and physical education teacher each for every rural primary school (township and below) starting from 2016. The training is open to primary school teachers in Jiangxi who are under the age of 45 and have a basic knowledge or talent in music, art, or physical education and can also teach other subjects.
Through training, we aim to equip them with basic knowledge and teaching skills in the field of aesthetics education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their ability to teach the subject, design activities, and cultivate campus culture, as well as their ability for self-development. By building a team of teachers who are proficient in multiple areas, we hope to alleviate the problem of a shortage of aesthetics teachers in rural areas. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to provide training for 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, with one trainee each for music, art, and physical education in each county, for a total of 300 trainees. The training will comprehensively enhance their ability to demonstrate teaching, lead research activities, conduct training, organize online research workshops, and serve as a teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising role.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes, we can't wait for another 20 minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.
I have found the buyer of the wrong order, but my tire is missing.
Hello, when will the ordered food be delivered?
Your delivery rider's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and his name is #NAME#. Can you please provide a reasonable explanation?
Sure, but your driver has some issues. Please handle it well.
Can you please check if it's still on the way? If it can be delivered, that would be the best OK. If it's really not available, then return the money for the order.
Actually, there are many requirements for clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls who are overweight, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long. It should be around the knee, just covering the fat on the thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
Clothes that are too long can give people a feeling of being short and plump. If you divide them into three sections of top, middle, and bottom, it will seem like you have naturally grown taller. For example, wearing a top, skirt, and long socks in different colors can create a sense of being tall. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the signature style of plump girls (the author deeply understands this point), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal a plump body. High-class and elegant black short skirts are also the first choice of plump girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make you look slimmer. If you have thick legs, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable. The more popular the style, the better. The color should not be too eye-catching.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and getting the impression that you are overweight, it's important to share some tips on how to dress for girls who are slightly overweight. Girls who are slightly overweight should not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and tops should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which can make you look uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, it's best to wear black tights or grid tights (the kind with fine patterns), and choose soft and delicate floral print skirts, paired with a blouse with a lapel collar. This can effectively cover up the shortcomings of overweight girls.
Of course, when chubby girls wear short skirts, they also have to be particular about it. Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of the skirt, which can make your figure look taller. Pairing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN combination for the summer!
If you are an MM with a fat upper body but thin legs, I recommend choosing a short dress with a sense of luxury. Not only can it cover your belly skin, but it can also showcase your advantages. An A-style short dress will look slimming, which is more suitable for chubby girls. For the top, choose something tight-fitting to create a sense of layering, which will make you look even slimmer.
Keep it simple with a white T-shirt and a short skirt. Even plus-size girls can try it. Girls with a bit of extra weight can also exude fashion sense. As long as you master the rules of dressing and matching, plus-size girls will be the center of attention.
After changing in the clothing coordination aspect, it's also important to exercise more in daily life and strive to shed the label of "chubby girl" early in the morning 😄

The appearance material: The appearance is quite cool, the game itself is a wind display effect. Display effect: The screen is quite clear, playing games at 1080p is enough for a laptop, and it feels quite good. It is mainly used for design and has a high cost-performance ratio, lighter than imagined, and better looking than imagined. The red on the butt is a very nice color of wine, not too flashy, and the overall is much higher than expected, worth buying. It is also quite suitable for girls.
Two years ago, I started using the Hengqi Dark Knight, and it took me two years to use it. The cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the quality is too hard! My friends around me also all recommend purchasing this product! Currently, I have purchased this series of three machines!
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also very good for buying for my nephew. I originally planned to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he was in a hurry, so I had to buy it early. Therefore, I missed the big bank activity, which is a bit regretful. However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics are also quite fast. I will come back to evaluate it for a while.
This is a brand new, high-performance gaming laptop with excellent value for money. It has a very nice design and has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019, which looks great.

The computer is quite good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, even if you don't understand, it's good to ask, and the recommendation to buy is not bad. The game's graphics are really top-notch.
An order of shrimp dumplings only has one? Why does the copy have 6?
I won't go, I'm a delivery person. In the past hour, no one has contacted me, which is basically an online scam.
Do you think this is the first time I've ordered takeout? After you finished your investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing my order, and that's why it was successful. How many days ago was that?
From 7 pm to now 9:30 am, it has not been delivered yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Claiming to have the loudest exhaust in the New Mountain District! This time, our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men! It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of this car is close to two million yuan, and the annual road tax is several thousand yuan. It has four wheels and is called LP700 because it has 700 horsepower. Can you imagine how fast it is? Well, even the editor doesn't know the exact figure, but according to the data, it can accelerate from 0 to 100km/h in just 2.9 seconds. That means that by the time the editor's Myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h. Wow.
The low car body, the imposing scissor door, the large air intakes scattered around the car body, and the glass bottom revealing a 6.5 v12 engine perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini. No need to say too much about the car model, you can Google it yourself. The editor has prepared some explanations that may not be available on Google. It's too eye-catching, and everyone is looking at it, making me feel a bit uncomfortable (but actually quite cool).
1km oil cost is around RM1 (car owners don't care at all). You need to practice the posture of getting in and out of the car, otherwise you may feel a bit embarrassed (because you won't be able to get out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud, and your ears will be ringing after getting out of the car (but it's still very cool).
The car is too big to fit into a regular parking spot, and there's a risk of being hit by the gate when a neighboring car opens it. It's a bit lonely on the road with no competitors (I'm talking to myself, not related to the car owner, haha). Please don't misunderstand, this video's supercar isn't for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot videos of your car, welcome to contact us! More car information that you don't know is in The Car Guide / People's Automotive Encyclopedia, which is worth millions of car accidents!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are cars that most car enthusiasts are familiar with. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of a Porsche 911 is also in the millions! Recently, in just a few minutes, a million-dollar supercar Chiron and a Porsche 911 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars were both involved in accidents abroad. Looking at the results, it was well worth it!
I ordered a package and two things were delivered incorrectly.
How can the order pay the service fee to the rider now?

Yes, the order is in the accepted state, but the restaurant called to say that the delivery rider cannot deliver the bones, so the restaurant needs to cut the meat and bones apart. Is it clear that the bones need to be discarded?
It's not about order delay or can you call me directly to ask if I'm following up?

The full-vision wedding photography base (Hebei store) does not currently have any branch stores for wedding fashion and makeup. The makeup artist is also top-notch. The photography techniques and angles are professional, and the shooting effects are very good. The seller is highly trustworthy, and the service attitude is also very good.
The makeup is very delicate, and the team service is also very good. This trip is very happy and very professional team, the seller's service attitude is very good, will introduce to friends, very satisfied. Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, let me have a unique wedding dress photo. Thank you to all the staff who helped take the wedding dress photos today, looking forward to seeing the finished product.
Taking wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for the photographer who has to run and jump around. The makeup artist was very thoughtful and designed a makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer had a humorous and lively shooting style, and it was worth praising. I am grateful to my photographer and makeup artist, and I hope to see myself looking this good for the rest of my life.
Praise the bride, she is beautiful and well-proportioned, looking like a virtuous wife and mother. She is frugal and takes care of the household. The groom is lucky to have her, and they will live a happy and prosperous life together. The wedding photo quality is really good, just like what it said online, my partner and I look handsome and beautiful, and we are very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude is also very enthusiastic. This time on the trip, not only did we admire the scenery, but we also took beautiful wedding photos and even made friends with the photographer. The wedding photos are so beautiful that they blew up the photographer and makeup artist. You guys are really super super professional.
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Sister Mu for her patience and dedication in accompanying and teaching me. I really like the photos that were taken~ When I saw the wedding dress photo, I was surprised that I didn't recognize myself in that moment. As long as the photographer is skilled, you can also have stunning wedding photos that can rival those of celebrities.
The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and makeup artist are both aesthetic. Fortunately, I met them. After seeing my wedding photos, I found out that I was also a "trickster".
Asian American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a joint complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on the 23rd, protesting against discrimination against Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three top schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called "holistic review" admission process, systematically and continuously. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the admission rate of Asians relative to the total number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhu Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in admissions. They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's complaint also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.
Why is the order still being executed even though the tableware has just been cancelled?
Can you help me check if it has been canceled?
But I have already placed an order at 5:09 this morning.
On the other side is the reservation hotline. They said they don't know anything, can't I just contact them directly by phone?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yushan Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and transferred 200,000 yuan to the seller's bank account as a deposit. Lin signed on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the recipient, stating that "if the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week."
However, due to disagreements on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory for sale and payment methods, the property sale contract has not been signed for a long time. Considering that both parties have failed to reach an agreement on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu. The house that was carefully selected, the deposit was paid, and the down payment was also ready, just waiting to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yongjia City People's Court. After the court conducted a trial, it determined that both parties ultimately failed to sign a formal contract, and it was not appropriate to solely blame the defendant. Therefore, the case should not apply the penalty of double the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the liability of breaching the contract by paying double the deposit. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Circuit Court upheld the original judgment. [Lawyer's Reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence in the transaction process. As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence in verifying information such as the ownership of the property, whether the property is currently occupied, and other relevant information when signing the contract. It is also important to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send the wrong address.
Translation:  Ri Chang Restaurant (Wu Dao Kou Store) [Mint] Environment: Mid-range [Service Bell] Service: Quick service "Old-style Marble Cake" is my must-order dish. The marble cake is too fragrant, too soft, and too delicious 😋 If you like desserts, you must try "East River Mandarin Fish Sweet and Sour Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh, the tofu is tender, the Mandarin fish has a good flavor, and the service is enthusiastic.
It's been a long time since I last came to Dayuang. The fruit tea is still so delicious and made with real ingredients. I tried the pork chop for the first time and it had a soft, southern-style texture that I loved. The congee was just right in terms of moisture, and the portion size was very generous. The signature stainless steel chicken wings were as good as ever, and the soup was also quite tasty. The flavor of the oregano was well-handled. Overall, I was impressed with the taste, service, and quality of the meat.
The text is about a restaurant called "Ri Chang Lao Diàn" that was once a popular internet celebrity. It was located in a small building on Dong An Street and had wooden floors. People had to wait for a long time to eat the famous congee (a type of rice porridge) at the restaurant, and the pot in which the congee was cooked had become cracked over time. The author mentions that they haven't been to the restaurant in several years, as the rise of various small restaurants serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat as soon as you arrive at the restaurant, and the quality of the dishes is as good as ever. The taste is excellent, the meat is delicious, and the main dishes are praiseworthy. The takeout from Day Chang is also great.
Rice Meal: The dish this time was a bit disappointing. Three-cup chicken: The vegetables were a bit too much, and the chicken was a bit too little. The main seasoning was a bit off, the saltiness was not enough, which highlighted the sweetness, everyone can add their own ideas for sweetness and various spices to the dish...
What is the method of drinking red label whisky? Everyone's hobbies are different, some like collecting, some like food, of course, there are also those who like to drink wine. Red label whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won international wine awards. Each bottle of red label whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to savor it, won't you waste its aroma and flavor?
So, how do you drink Red Letter Whiskey? Let me introduce it to you simply. The method of drinking Red Letter Whiskey is as follows:
The Glenfiddich 15-year-old single malt Scotch whisky is made from a blend of about 35 different Scotch whiskies. It has a rich and fragrant aroma with traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, and a fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. On the palate, it is rich and refreshing with a hint of grassiness. This whisky can be enjoyed on its own over ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red wine enters the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the people, red wine + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other fizzy drinks have become a timeless fashion. These sweet drinks can not only neutralize the sour taste, but also visually bring pleasure to people, and play a role in diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the mouthfeel when added to the drink. The most authentic and traditional way to drink red wine is with slices of lemon and sugar (cane sugar is also acceptable).
The authentic red wine has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon can bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. The above three are the best ways to drink red wine, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
If you cannot change my store location, can I have it delivered instead?
So I don't need to give you any more money, right?
The colleague's order has been delivered, but the GPS can't be reached. Is it there or not?
Mrs. Jin's wedding dress photography (Nanjie store) has not yet had branch photography because we did not arrange the time well. We changed the time twice, and consultant Lanlan was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a good weekend to shoot.
The staff at Jin Furen's workplace, whether it be consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all amazing. That was my first formal makeup job, wow~ I can't believe it, I'll be beautiful one day too, haha. Xiao Jie and another sister (sorry, I forget her name) did my makeup with great patience and it looked very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Kowloon City, fortunately, the weather was very good that day and we didn't feel too cold during the photo shoot. The makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, accessories, and immediately help us if there was anything not quite right. The photographer was also very humorous and we felt very happy throughout the day of taking photos. When it came to selecting the photos, because we had seen many cases online, we didn't want the guests to delete too many photos, but during our photo selection, there was absolutely no pressure to add more photos. The package we chose included 24 photos, and we didn't add a single one (I heard that my cousin who got married around the same time had a package of over 7,000 yuan and added over 1,000 yuan worth of photos. At the time, I was shocked and afraid that I would end up choosing too many).
Today's photos were edited well by Lanlan and sent to me. I saw two of them and thought they weren't quite good enough, so they immediately helped me re-edit them. I compared the photos of my sister taken before with ours, and I am really satisfied with our photos. They are simple, clean, and have the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Jinfu Lady for wedding dress photoshoots!
Set price: 3999 yuan. Thank you for your sincere wishes, may you be happy and fulfilled. The price of this set, how much is it?
What conditions must be met in order to use $32?
That's fine, you don't need to return the money.
Your driver says he can't find it, but I can't understand the English he's speaking.
Shall I return the curry base to you?
I only received half of it, there are six boxes that I haven't seen and haven't been sent.
The company is working overtime, and we haven't had lunch yet. We wanted to order takeout, but our order was canceled.
You are called Zheng Meng. This is your second week in Japan. You are walking on the street, suddenly you find someone following you. You are scared and start running faster. The person behind you shouts: "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese dialogue) You stop at the door of the convenience store.
"Miss... I'm a director. I think you're very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?" You're very suspicious and afraid that this is a scam. He gives you a business card, and you discover that he's really a director from a major entertainment company in Japan.
"If you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The fee is definitely not to be missed." You hesitated and agreed to come to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street at a glance and hoped you could come. You thought there was no loss and you could still make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts. In the first part, celebrities and ordinary people will live together in real life to cultivate mutual understanding. In the second part, they will enter the game together to overcome challenges.

So, how will the system handle the driver for the new order?
I think I cannot accept an order that takes more than 20 minutes to deliver.
1,100 newborns in Sabah without birth certificates due to counterfeit paper shortage (Kota Kinabalu, November 11) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper running out, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, with a total of 1,100 affected so far. However, the department's director, Kamaruzaman Abu Kassim, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and they will be issued once the counterfeit-proof paper arrives next week.
He made an explanation at a press conference regarding a news report by a certain online media about the issue of newsprint printing in Sabah that lasted for 10 months. He said that the issue arose two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory producing anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in its arrival in our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from that of other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' inventory. Keryl Amynius revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeiting paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work. "The agency will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the goods on Thursday next week, and the final stage of printing will be carried out immediately upon returning to Sabah. It is estimated that it can be delivered to the applicant's hands within two working days (December 20th)."
"We will notify the applicants to collect their admission tickets at various branch offices." He added that a total of 24,801 admission tickets have been issued in Sabah so far this year.
From 7 o'clock plus until now, isn't it almost time to eat? I'm referring to the food.
I am waiting across from #PRS\_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you, the restaurant says it's ready.
So I placed a new order using accumulated points, thank you.

It runs very stably, and there is no sense of lag. The sound of the fan for heat dissipation is good, and it feels like it's working. It doesn't spin like a gaming notebook all the time.

Recently, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ji Ping, met with the president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, in the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
When meeting, Kovacevic actively evaluated the China-Montenegro relationship and expressed that he had a deep impression of China's excellent organizational work during the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008.

The Montenegrin side hopes to use this as an opportunity to conduct more extensive sports exchanges and cooperation with China. Ji Ping stated that China and Montenegro have a special "olympic bond". The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open, presenting a simple, safe, and exciting event to the world.
We look forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in areas such as winter sports event preparation and athlete training. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue playing a bridging role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to continuously deepen people-to-people exchanges between the two countries and let the people of the two countries "move towards the future" together. Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete Awards" ceremony, and Tiandi, as a special guest, presented awards to the best young athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. At the event, a promotional video for the Beijing Winter Olympics was looped.

The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism has issued a notice requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control at ports of entry. It stipulates that those who have recently left land border ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) must provide proof of a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours, and those entering land border ports of entry must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. The notice states that this requirement will be in effect from the date of announcement of the port of entry cities by each province, district, and municipality until March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice proposes that cities with ports that meet certain conditions can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction. A relevant person in charge of the National Health Commission introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is the main economic support, and frequent exchanges occur between the two sides of the border. By implementing differentiated management policies, a single line of epidemic prevention and control can become two lines, which is expected to achieve pre-border control, compress the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported through ports of entry in cities. The aforementioned notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, inadequate implementation of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of the entire cold chain, inadequate management of quarantine sites, and inadequate scientific and precise handling of epidemic emergencies. The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in port cities, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to fill the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control work in port cities, without any relaxation, and to do the work of epidemic prevention and control in a scientific and precise manner, and to tighten the external defense line to prevent the importation of the epidemic.
The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the work of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihoods, publish and publicize the hotline for people's livelihood protection, and regularly investigate and address potential risks in areas such as the supply and price of basic necessities of life. According to the notice, the aforementioned port cities include those with land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (prefectures, cities, leagues), and directly-administered municipalities, with the specific scope determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the central government) based on the needs of epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machines" on the Bilibili platform sparked widespread attention.
This film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan War under the pretext of "counter-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through war, resulting in 20 years of impoverished soldiers, bloodthirsty nature, and indiscriminate killings, committing various anti-human atrocities. The excessive use of drone strikes on civilian facilities such as hospitals and schools has distorted human nature and formed killing squads. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation. One atrocity after another has aroused more hatred among the Afghan people. As the video said, the US "anti-terror" war is becoming more and more terrifying.
War has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only brought a country full of wounds and countless killings and destructions. Let's watch the video together to uncover the truth behind the United States' so-called "anti-terrorism" and bloody massacres, and expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
The food delivery was late, and the food had cooled down. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard, and it was completely impossible to eat, and the soup also spilled out.
Immediately cancel it. The things that he #PRS\_ORG# supplemented have definitely cooled down, and I haven't taken them! #NAME# said that no one has gone to take them.
If you don't refund the money after we talk on the phone, I will report you to the police.
I have used #PRS\_ORG# multiple times before, but today's experience was the worst. It was completely unacceptable.
However, it is also necessary to remind the restaurant and the delivery riders to avoid a similar incident from happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time, but the time keeps getting delayed and I don't know when to expect it.
If you cancel an order, can you get a refund for the deposit?
How do I pay the service fee to the driver?
"A rider confirmed more than an hour ago that they were unwilling to wait any longer."
Don't intimidate people at the starting line. When browsing bookstores, one can often feel the heat of success books. Many of the popular success books today preach the "best principle" - that is, first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do "is what."
Equating it to saying that the "how to do it" is the most important and fundamental link. Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are full of enthusiasm and do their best, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just wait in place. This "best principle" makes everyone admit that it is "absolutely correct", but 99% of people are intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make up your mind, remake yourself, and undergo a 180-degree great turnaround," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who adhere to the status quo, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you should shout "you must transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the fool. Almost all people will feel fear and hesitation before the word "transformation," taking small steps and finding it hard to make a decision; or they may make a sudden decision to transform and take the first step boldly, but it often doesn't last long, and they fall back soon, and it's hard to see any continuity.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "Starting from Tomorrow" dialogue most vividly demonstrated this "universal human nature" classic. The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the entry threshold is too high. It often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, leaving the vast majority of people feeling frustrated and disappointed. Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a possible path for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core principle of "the next best thing" is to "lower the bar" - it encourages a "small wins lead to big wins" theory, that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dunes in front of your home is also fine, because that is still better than staying in the same place. Overall, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing. With the bar significantly lowered, it creates the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres, the chances of success will increase.
Following the "second-best principle" path to success may be a slightly longer journey, but overall, the "best principle" may raise the banner of making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can only motivate a few. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
The phone has been ringing unanswered for a long time and the package hasn't been delivered yet.
May I ask for the delivery time? How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He is two meals short of delivering, but there is an order that has already been completed. I want to ask how to contact the delivery rider who told me about it earlier. Shouldn't there be another rider coming to deliver?
The naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 710 tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results obtained by journalists from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department. The total storage capacity of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has reached 108.5 thousand tons, increasing by more than 40 times compared to the protected initial period in 2002. Naked carp is a valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
During the 1960s and 1970s of the 20th century, the Tibetan antelope population in the Qinghai Lake area was severely reduced due to factors such as large-scale hunting, degradation of breeding habitats, and environmental deterioration. By 2002, the total storage of Tibetan antelope resources in Qinghai Lake had decreased to only 2,592 tons. In 2004, the Tibetan antelope was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any units, groups, or individuals from fishing for Tibetan antelopes or selling them or their products.
Meanwhile, through measures such as artificial breeding and release and the cleaning of the main inflow rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passageways," the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has continued to increase annually. Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department Deputy Director Yang Lin introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 billion naked carp have been artificially bred and released in Qinghai Lake, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources. The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan region is an important ecological barrier and water source recharge area not only in China but also in Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the Qinghai Lake water area, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, establishing a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, even though the weather was cold.
May I ask, is the takeout delivered in a bag? We only see a bag and want to know if it's short-delivered or if someone took it, thank you.
It's been 1 hour already, but it still hasn't been delivered.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and it's quite disappointing to send the wrong order. I have to make another reservation for the children to eat. I hope the restaurant can check the quality of the food while being busy.
Taking a foot bath and feeling a tingling sensation in your feet, is it due to electric leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the increase in people's awareness of health, foot baths are becoming more and more popular, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice.
In related data tables, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-related household appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. "It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking in the bathtub.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a pen, and the pen surprisingly lit up. Mr. Li discovered that there was electricity in the water of the foot bath. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although the foot bath was returned. Mr. Li still felt unsatisfied.
Because he found that this popular bathtub for a long time has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular bathtub.
"Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards. You can easily test it with a pen."
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily - Hunan Voice Online December 10 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Chaoyu, Hu Qianqian, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Changhe Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a billion-ton tea industry. Vice Chairman of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Association, Hou Shunli, and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, grandly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhui, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into the "Five-color Tea of Xiang". In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the thousand-billion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Xiang, Four Waters, Five-color Tea". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert force, and the main tea-producing areas promoting tea tourism integration, driving large-scale tea farmers to increase income.
The wind water turns alternately, and red tea exerts its strength again. According to tea experts in the industry, after harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens increases linearly. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leader awarded the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and new changes welcomed the "Lake Red Source".
In the Xinhuai Tea Exhibition Hall, a tea merchant from Fujian was attracted by a type of tea called "Ice in Spring" and placed an order on the spot. The secretary-general of the provincial tea industry association, Wang Jun, happily said that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea leaf market, but from the tea expo site, it can be seen that there are many highlights. The Xinhuai red tea has a touch of red, injecting cultural connotations into tea, and the popularity and trading are booming. The tea industry in Hunan is welcoming a new spring.

Time Capsule Photography Temporarily no branch member evaluation [effect] Photography results: Took pictures of two pieces of clothing. Overall, it's not bad. I like this set of photos quite a bit.
[Service] Service details: Because I felt a bit uncomfortable during pregnancy while doing makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest on one side while continuously providing me with warm water to drink. The price for this service was 1000 yuan. Thank you, Rabbit, for your review. Originally, I had said that I didn't like the ancient style, but the finished product was so beautiful that I didn't expect it.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can fill us with energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend it to all my little buddies! There is nothing to fault from reception, makeup, costumes, lighting, photography, to post-production.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match your makeup style to suit you. The makeup products used are all top brands. As for the teacher, Mr. Tian, it's quite professional when it comes to photography. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and it takes half a year to queue for the popular movie theaters in Beijing. My colleagues have shot some films in Beijing, and after watching them, I thought they were just so-so. I specially searched for this studio, which is a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expression management is not very good, and we think this is the short version for most people. The photographer, Brother Li, will capture and record the natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a top-notch team. The finished product has left us and those around us speechless with praise. I have already recommended my close friend and she just watched the final cut and is equally overjoyed.
I hope this kind of studio won't be buried and more people can discover ta and show their own style instead of being uniform. Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Jingling and Xingying, both of whom are very creative and talented newcomers. We are a creative studio, and as long as the client likes us, we will put in 200% effort to complete the job. We are grateful to meet such a sweet and helpful assistant, as well as a lively and open-minded photographer teacher. Everyone in the team is super nice and it was a wonderful experience to work with them. The results of the photos exceeded my expectations and it was an unforgettable experience. Thank you everyone! 😘😘
Thank you for your review, knowing you is also a kind of fate. From Chongqing to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you, and I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao again to play.
How should I give the money? The re-sent meal has already been delivered.
There is no driver to receive me now, the restaurant staff is calling me.
A beginner programmer who wants to share personal experiences. If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to find a place to receive training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and it takes 6 months to learn. However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed an excellent choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline, training is even better.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. Firstly, you should look at the institution's teacher strength, if the teacher strength is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning, of course, some newly opened training institutions may not have particularly strong teacher strength.
Secondly, before selecting a training institution, it is best to inquire about the institution's students. After all, only the students of the institution know how good or bad the courses taught by the institution are. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because you have not introduced your own situation. Learning this thing is closely related to your personal situation. For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you are in, all of these will be related to the industry you want to learn or engage in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has graduated, in my personal opinion, if you have enough time, I recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also quite good, but the learning cost is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. However, if you are in the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili for more training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through introduction to obtain free resources, or for detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining videos.
If you are not a computer professional but can pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, I suggest going to a training institution to learn. This way, learning doesn't have to be very tiring, and the teachers explain in detail. If you have any questions, there are people specially assigned to answer them. Moreover, in terms of learning planning or supervision, it is also helpful. In addition, many training institutions now sign employment contracts, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after studying, which can save a lot of trouble in the job interview stage. Above are my views, and I briefly introduced them before because I didn't know your situation.

I said I would be there at 1 point, and I saw it in the app.
What do you mean I haven't finished speaking, what are you doing?
I, undertake various services (installation, cleaning, maintenance) of wall-mounted stoves, hot water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove tops, oil heaters, lighting fixtures, and glass cleaning. I am a professional seamstress and offer household services. I would like to thank those who have silently given me a thumbs up. Life is tough, but we must continue to live and not waste the efforts we have made. If you like, please follow me. Thank you to those who have silently given me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only see the results, but we have to endure the process alone. When facing life, besides being strong, we have no other choice but to continue. We can look back at the road we've traveled, but we can't go back and retrace our steps. Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes exquisite through dedication. Although we do the dirtiest job of cleaning, we approach it with the most serious attitude, cleaning every corner of our clients' homes until they are sparkling clean. Seeing the satisfied smile and the thumbs up from our clients, at that moment, all the hard work is worth it, and the effort pays off!
My daily work - Your requirements, my service. Heartfelt service, heartfelt cleaning, to preserve the beauty.
The details you care about, Fengguo Home Services have done it to "perfection" for you, serving with love. Protecting every family's cleanliness, planting home management milestones, serving to the right place, and cleaning to the home. Indoor and outdoor cleaning are my daily work.
The crystal lamp is magnificent, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. Similarly, success in life requires careful effort and exquisite craftsmanship. We take every detail seriously. Give me a chance, and I will definitely satisfy you. Quality speaks for everything because professionalism deserves trust. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
The current situation in various industries is not easy at all! But I always believe that as long as I maintain a serious attitude, persevere, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least better than those who just complain and do nothing! A day's plan starts with the morning, and all the beauty begins with the dawn. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction, maintain a good mood all day, and good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed; as we grew older, happiness became a goal to be achieved; and as we matured, we realized that happiness was a state of mind. By being true to ourselves and acting with kindness, we can live a fulfilling life. There is only one path in life, and we must walk it ourselves. The two greatest treasures in life are good health and a good mood, which can keep us bright and lively until old age. At every stage of life, we will encounter different challenges.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but your courage to face things positively. Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; but if you face challenges head-on, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The curator of the China Sand Museum collaborated with the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Culture to hold the first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale - China News Network China News Service Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Guan) The first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art District located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating. This biennale is co-curated by the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Yan Fuyu, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this year's biennial exhibition is "Feeling for Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and reflects the current state of cultural development in Saudi Arabia. The biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Feeling for Stones to Cross the River", "Experiment as Inheritance", "Borderline Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create works using recycled materials, such as Xue Huan's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Stream of Qiyun Mountain" (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using waste
The chief executive of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakri, stated that he hopes this year's biennale can establish international dialogue and allow global audiences to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative communities, enhancing interaction and communication. Tan Feiyu said, "The goal of the biennale is dual. On the one hand, it aims to allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation, and on the other hand, it aims to immerse Saudi audiences in the world of contemporary art." It is understood that a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, where artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the art and creative industries will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.
I ordered from the axe and cleaver restaurant, and they told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver bones. I want to ask for clarification on the reason.
Bones can be, call the restaurant to arrange for delivery separately.
However, the system is not very convenient. You have to use another room.

Yunnan: Regulate and Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) To continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken populations, to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently launched policies to promote the regulation and standardization of the management of public welfare posts in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. According to the relevant responsible person of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare posts, which are used for the employment of poverty-stricken labor and other rural disadvantaged groups, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken people achieve employment income, consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects.
This regulation was jointly issued by the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Rural Revitalization, the Ministry of Finance, and five other departments. It mainly standardizes the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, post development, post management, and other aspects. In terms of post development, the regulation clearly stipulates that it should be developed according to the principles of "post-based recruitment, post-based appointment, dynamic management, and quota control", "who develops the post, who uses it, and who is responsible for it", and "one person, one post, voluntary public recruitment, and unified management". The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public notice, appointment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the departments mainly responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for the subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the departments in charge of rural public welfare positions to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel in those positions. It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.
The address is wrong, can you cancel the order?
Have I canceled the order again?
II. Although the rightists had a period of being resolute in history, it was not long-lasting. This is because a little bit of sunshine can make things flourish, and a sip of water can make one sweat. As soon as they have a little bit of ambition, they look towards Shu (a region in western China), but as soon as they are struck, they fall to the ground. However, when it comes to the matter of facts, the rightists have played a positive role in the process of social progress. From defining the standard of truth during the end of the Cultural Revolution, promoting economic development and technological advancement, to promoting the institutionalization of government and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
Three: As for me, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he has to say, and I respect him as a person. He is sincere, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, a chaotic political situation, and foreign powers taking advantage of the situation.  Four: To change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and its people. Those who engage in political opportunism and try to take advantage of the situation are not right-wingers, they are just scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left again. The left is actually a bunch of orphans of history and politics. If we say that the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when needed. But the left doesn't have this advantage, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Recently, I have seen some friends mocking both thieves and leftists, and they seem to have a lot of energy. I think it's not necessary at all. Don't try to reason with traitors and leftists, they are both a bunch of nonsense that can't be reasoned with. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making thieves and leftists acknowledge it. What's the point?
I tell my friends: When the anti-thief curses you for five yuan, and when the leftist curses you for being a rightist, it just proves that the middle path we are taking is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but forgot about them as they grew older, or pursued their ideals but ended up becoming obsessed. As they drifted further and further away from their ideals, even the once-noble young dragon could eventually become a wicked dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom, and historically and culturally, China has a tendency towards the left. Domestically, the right emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left focuses on regulation and fairness. Currently, society as a whole tends to prioritize fairness, and with the competition between China and the US, being left-leaning is certain to continue for many years to come.
Although I can't understand it, a like is enough, it doesn't matter what it says, it's all about the aesthetics.
I can't wait any longer, I have to place an order at 19:06, it's been 2 hours already 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange" hot searches. What is normal public opinion? Randomly selecting three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Lifting its Head, Pretty Friends Rising in Price, and the Incident of Goods Being Carried Away, public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index drops (following a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, small peaks may reappear.
They look completely different from the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" previously displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China. What is abnormal public opinion? By randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, they present a "lonely peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" pattern.
The following text has been translated from Chinese to English:  【Peak shape】 refers to human-induced heating, which quickly rises to the top of the hot search list and attracts widespread attention; 【Serrated shape】 refers to periodic heating, which ensures that the topic remains at the top of the hot search list; 【Cliff shape】 refers to collective withdrawal, where a hot search topic has fulfilled its "function" and moves on to a new task and a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's popularity is exactly the trough of another event's popularity, with only a few seconds between them. This must be a coordinated water army receiving a new task and launching a new offensive. The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot topics are simultaneously on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke and lead, which ones shift attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, and which ones influence decision-making. Black PR accounts are divided into batches and fine-t
Propagation is a science, discarding all subjective factors such as stance and emotions, and only relying on objective data, even black PR will be powerless. Wherever one goes, they will leave a trace, such traces, let's dig them out together. Data source: Time Machine Hot Search.
Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the new coronavirus. Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron strain infection on the 10th.
According to the Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected individual is a local resident of Mauritius who came into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa and tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th. After receiving medical treatment in isolation, both infected individuals have now tested negative for COVID-19 and have returned to their respective homes. The Cyprus Health Department announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
These three people are all students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of the month. Since they are all asymptomatic, they have not been hospitalized for treatment. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain, the government of S has stepped up prevention and control measures. From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense upon arrival at the airport.
The Sao Tome and Principe Health Department announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Malawi Health Minister Khumbize Kandodo said on the 9th that the country has detected 3 cases of omicron variant infection for the first time. The country's health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found these 3 cases of infection.

Have I already placed a new order for a refund on the previous order?
If it's not possible, please cancel the order and refund.
Thinking of having breakfast early, but it's already 7 o'clock and I haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you're saying... Is your Chinese translated or do you prefer to use English?
Shall I send a message to call him?

The text you provided is written in Chinese and reads:  收到是金钱肚订单是凤爪好的，电话是 #PHONENUMBER#  Here's the English translation:  "The order for the money belt is confirmed. The phone number is #PHONENUMBER#."
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained to them.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration Address: Huan Cheng Nan Lu 156 Hao Xing Fu Yuan 12 Floor  It all started with a friend's introduction because of trust. At first, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
As soon as I arrived at the store, a series of scams began. This was my first time there, and I only showed them my house plan. They didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote and say that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't even know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that once you came to the store, they would drag you into paying the deposit (and once you paid, you would never be able to get it back unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, they can give you how much discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan deposit. The quotation he gave me had many problems, 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, did not include any doors and cabinets, and the bathroom was not included. These three are the basic costs.
Excluding their service charges, which are higher than those of other companies, I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything to me before I signed the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they seemed very experienced, with a dedicated team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it happens, biting to death is always the customer's problem, and they are completely blameless. There are all sorts of shifting of responsibility, as well as many details, and I don't want to go into them all; it's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend found that the house they decorated was of poor quality, and they charged all sorts of fees in the end. These people are like the head of a scam, pretending to be big and American now, but seem to have gone bankrupt and changed to something else.
So don't choose such unreliable decoration companies. In the future, when you choose, remember to search on Baidu and check these consultations because decoration is not cheap. If you want to ask a merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of merchant reviews. For more details, please see the merchant registration statement. We provide you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours, for the "360 Integrated Home Decoration" channel in Kunming. If you want to find a decoration company, just go to the public reviews.
So terrifying, please cancel the order if it takes less than 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if 15 minutes or less could be canceled.
The fried chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it.
I haven't received a response for 3 days... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly subscription plan! What's even stranger is that I use the same credit card every time I pay, but now I have to pay shipping fees every time.
Can you first exempt me from paying the monthly fee until your investigation is completed, and then collect it afterwards? Is that possible?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's already almost 3 o'clock, isn't it time for me to receive compensation and have the goods delivered?
But the courier was left at the door, and then the person left and it was delivered to the wrong address.
Your delivery rider has already taken my order #NUMBER# for delivery, but they are still telling me to wait. They informed me at 19:25 that they have received my order, but they refuse to leave to complete the delivery. Do I need to place another order?
What should I do if my driver has arrived but I'm not ready yet?
I am going to send the package, if you don't cancel it, I will report it.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior of attacking people. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this kind of scoundrel. If we do not look at political parties and factions, the first thing we need to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
Since you started sending me Facebook friend requests and posting mocking posts, and then tried to publish what you called my home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude. After you left, you became even more persistent in tagging me on a daily basis, and continued to discuss some ambiguous and humiliating remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether or not I sleep around. I...have had enough. But later, I received multiple friend requests from Facebook friends uploading a photo of me and containing sexual harassment comments.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After I reported the news, you showed no restraint and became even more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your identity and status. In our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you are just concerned and caring about me, and you believe that this is not harassment. You can even continue to deny that those images were not made by you or continue to publish all kinds of attacking statements. That's right, I cannot and do not have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your comments.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate her so much just to become famous. My friend asked me if I was okay, and I said I was, but you wouldn't believe me.
I think it is impossible for any woman to be bullied to such an extent and still say that she is doing well. Whether it is in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in this way. I believe that justice resides in the hearts of people.
I have cut some of your comments for everyone to evaluate the post you sent. Shouldn't there be anyone who can impersonate you? I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.
The Chinese phrase "会心一笑" can be translated to "smiling at each other" or "laughing together" in English. It conveys the idea of two people sharing a joyful moment and enjoying each other's company through their smiles and laughter.
I have reported and attached a picture, but have not received a reply.
What kind of cow, if you don't point it out, it's a chicken with sour mouth, and there's no way to eat fresh meat.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not leftovers?
The translation of the given text from Chinese to English is as follows:  "It's unacceptable, I've already placed the order and was told it would be delivered at 7 o'clock."

On December 22nd, we went to "Hansdun" water purifier store to see the water purifiers. There was an activity going on inside the store with relatively favorable prices.
