南非周日向FW德克勒克，白人统治的最后一任总统，举行了官方纪念仪式。德克勒克在1990年释放了曼德拉，并带领南非从种族隔离向民主转型。德克勒克于11月11日因癌症去世，享年85岁。

De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.

"He was often misunderstood due to his over-correctness," De Klerk's widow Elita Georgiadis told around 200 attendees.

ASSISTANT: 随后，曼德拉成为南非第一位黑人总统，在1994年他的非洲人国民党赢得了选举。周日早上，南非总统哥雷亚萨（Cyril Ramaphosa）参加了开普敦的基督教大教堂（Protestant Groote Kerk），以为德克勒克（F.W. de Klerk）致敬。“由于他过于谨慎，他经常被误解，”德克勒克的妻子伊莱塔·乔治亚迪斯（Elita Georgiadis）告诉大约200位听众。

Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.

Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.

ASSISTANT: 批评家说他与 apartheid 时期的罪行无法分离，如果他活得更长，他应该为这些罪行负责。德克勒克代表国民党，该党在1948年正式建立了 apartheid 的种族隔离和非洲南部非白人多数的剥夺权利。在教堂外，一小群抗议者持着“正义被拒绝”和“对 apartheid 受害者的正义”的标语，迅速被警察带走。

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt.

While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.

It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.

ASSISTANT: Gabba双重停电解释及其为什么可能再次发生风险的停电风险与澳大利亚墨尔本球场（Gabba）的广播设施设置有关，不太可能在下一场阿什斯系列赛之前得到改善，因为板球当局等待更多关于该球场主要升级计划的细节，以便承办2032年奥运会。消息人士告诉《艾奇逊日报》和《悉尼观察报》，Gabba是澳大利亚板球的唯一一个主要球场，其场地内的主要电力供应不足以启动所需的广��
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 第四天，全球广播比赛的主要和备用发电机约25分钟停机。这是因为该区域的基础电力需要供应加布纳的灯塔（其中一个著名的灯塔在2019年的Big Bash League比赛中停电）和球场本身。因此，广播公司从一台巨大的柴油发电机中获取主要的电力供应，备用电力应该来自备用发电机。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.

ASSISTANT: 然而，在测试赛事的第四天，主发电机和备份发电机的故障导致两者同时停止运转，导致近30分钟内广播图像和DRS部分或完全丢失。NEP公司，它为福克斯和七网提供外部直播车和其他设施，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。所有将用于阿什赛（阿德莱德球场、墨尔本球场、悉尼球场和堪培拉球场）的场地都将提供主线电为广播商的主要供电，留下柴油发电机作为备份。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: 这种差异过去曾经给主播公司Fox Cricket带来了很大的焦虑，而在亚希斯测试期间，由于生产和技术人员的极大减少，无法密切关注比赛中不断滚动的许多隐喻性的球，这种差异变得更加严重。澳大利亚板球协会在几个月内收到Fox的警告，从技术角度来说，在其他地方比较安全地举办比赛，但如果留在加布纳，那么允许进入昆士兰的极少人员将带来“巨大风险”。

Molecular Diagnosis Test Can Detect Omicron Variant In 20 Minutes: Report Korean researchers have developed molecular diagnostics technology that can detect Omicron variants. The technology development has been currently completed, and it is expected to take time for commercialization.

ASSISTANT: 分子诊断测试可在20分钟内检测Omicron变异株：报道

韩国研究人员开发了一种分子诊断技术，可以检测Omicron变异株。该技术的研发已经完成，但商业化可能需要一定时间。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.

ASSISTANT: 10日，POSTECH宣布，由化学工程系李正旭教授带领的研究团队开发了一种分子诊断技术，可以在20-30分钟内检测到Omicron变异株，并将结果发布在线上。Omicron变异株在病毒的刺突蛋白中有26-32个突变，用于感染细胞的COVID-19病毒。据研究团队介绍，分子诊断技术可以区分单碱基变异，因此可以检测到“隐形Omicron”，这些变异株很难通过PCR测试检测到。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.

ASSISTANT: 目前，韩国疾病控制与预防中心正在使用三种方法来检测COVID-19变种：全基因分析、目标DNA（如刺突蛋白等突变）分析和PCR测试。在Delta变种的情况下，现有的PCR测试可以检测到，但Omicron则不能。这次新开发的技术不是一种测序方法，它可以读取DNA或RNA序列，而是分子诊断技术。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.

ASSISTANT: 现有技术仅针对病毒的特定区域进行筛查，而分子诊断技术是为了在COVID-19 RNA存在时仅引起核酸结合反应，从而实现快速检测。据李教授介绍，Omicron在PCR测试中对N基因具有强信号，但对S基因信号较弱。在“隐形Omicron”的情况下，N和S基因均为积极，从而增加了与其他变种区分的难度。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.

ASSISTANT: 分子诊断技术与PCR机制不同，能有效检测Omicron变异株。与传统技术相比，通常每台设备最多可处理96个样本，而新技术可在30分钟内处理超过125个样本（每小时超过250个样本）。此外，该技术不需要专门的设备，因此可以简单地制作诊断试剂盒。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.

ASSISTANT: 由于该方法可以在4天内开发诊断试剂盒，因此即使未来出现新变种或病毒，也能够迅速作出反应。“我希望这项技术的公开能够帮助我们尽快恢复正常的日常生活，”李教授说。我们将尽快进行新冠病毒可能出现的新变种的诊断和应对。

This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed. Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials.

ASSISTANT: 这项技术目前尚处于商业化前期。然而，它可以作为当前尚未开发PCR测试用于奥米冈变异株的情况下的辅助工具使用。李教授表示：“我认为，经过临床试验，这项技术将在下年第二季度接近商业化。”

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.

Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.
