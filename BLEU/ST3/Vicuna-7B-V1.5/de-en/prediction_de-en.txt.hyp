The product cost less than 20 euros. The fee corresponds to 40% of the product value... I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer and thus it is not a problem for me.
Please provide just a number or instruction on how to address the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I have to say that's very annoying.
Must I cancel the order and reorder for a better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I find it generally unfair to expect children to take on a parenting role for their younger siblings. However, I think it's good for older siblings to help out with the younger ones to some extent. Maybe just a quick look, maybe just a quick assist, maybe bringing the juice box, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved. As long as they can still take care of themselves, I see no problem. If your K1 spends the short time alone and it's okay for him, that's good too.
You can best determine whether it is suitable for your children. It is not that he should twist K2 and accompany them for hours while they fall asleep. It is probably legally questionable.
Maybe that's also the statement of the psychologist. After all, if something were to happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether you want to take on this risk is, of course, up to you :)
Please help me find the title of a book! I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't seem to remember the title anywhere. Maybe someone here knows... The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going to his raptor enclosure. The case is taken over by a commissioner who quickly becomes embroiled in a therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety. The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear of fire and ends up at this therapist's clinic.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet. At least it eventually turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where patients are given a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately have to confront their fears in the most extreme way (a woman jumps out of a window, another one kills herself intentionally).
The text describes an event that will be referred to as "the fight" in the book. At the end, there is a big showdown in a clinic that had something to do with fire. This is the basic plot, and I am pretty sure that the book was written by a French author/authoress.
If this story is known to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN available. I have to contact my husband. But that could take a while.
What steps should I take afterward?
Is it also possible to receive a refund for the price difference?
Child, 4 yrs old, splinter under the thumb nail Child, 4 years old, has a splinter under the thumb nail (outer side). Tried to remove it with a pincer.
Very difficult to grasp. Did not work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left. Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, which allows it to be installed in almost any locomotive of track width H0 and 0. LokSound 5 decoders are available with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker with a sound capsule assembly.
As all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder. He masters the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, decoders automatically register at an appropriate digital central station. It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, compatible central stations can read the CV values on the main track. For central stations that can only program CVs up to 255, there are helper registers.
Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels at 255 addresses. Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible centrals. The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes Märklin® brake tracks just as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC System. It is also possible to brake with DCC brake stones or with direct current.
In addition, he also has a Selectrix® brake diode. An ABC pendulum train automation enables automatic pendulating between two stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on analog DC and AC railways.
After my coupon cannot be extended due to a complaint that has not arrived with me, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere where customer friendliness is higher and I don't have to waste my fingers just to reach nothing! What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson plans to accelerate the booster campaign Politics and science in the UK are causing new Omikron cases. Therefore, all qualifying adults in England will receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Eve.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to speed up the COVID-19 booster vaccinations due to rapidly increasing Omikron numbers. Adults in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening. So far, the target date was end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns can be accelerated in the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish regions. We are facing an emergency due to the Omikron variant, so it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccine protection, said Johnson. The good news is that the vaccine level can be increased with a third dose of vaccine.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson. On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137. Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of a whopping 65%. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent out a job application. Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email.
I would like to respond to the email. However, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled him/her and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it can either be a man or a woman.
"I have no idea how to write this email. Can someone please help me? I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any toes."
Conclusion: Everyone should be familiar with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them go. The one I bought today doesn't go.
It is obvious that the chair had an invisible defect when it was sold. How can a cushion defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS\_ORG#. That doesn't work anymore since about 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have purchased 6 #PRS\_ORG# items, but I wanted to buy 8. However, there were none left. Now they are available again, and I would like to request that you add 2 chairs to my order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will be writing here about domestic violence in detail. I just need to express something from my soul.
I (21) frequently come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons. A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims cannot or do not want to seek help. I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in a private conversation with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to simply endure violence.
Often, I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. It won't get any easier, but please always remember that you are worth living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing design: "Arcane," the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix. Why are we excited about the already announced two-season order?
Basketball Bundesliga: Debacle of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim At least Johannes Patrick was left. Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomach." But this anger did not subside after the game - on the contrary, it was further fueled by the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. What was more disappointing than the bare result was the way the team performed.
A substitute statistic is named, which expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quote amounted to just 13 percent, 4 goals (all scored by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - more questions? The answer was provided by John Patrick: "We were not concentrated enough after our victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained for, namely moving the ball."
The reaction of his counterpart Sebastian Gleim was completely different: "It was a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people." There were only 750 spectators in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made the most of it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led his team's play. "The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim. While Patrick's team's key performers, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59. Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points. Fortunately, there was plenty of time left for discussion.
Already on Wednesday (7:00 PM), the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg before then.
We had earlier a different email address, but I have changed it.
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have informed ourselves legally again and have therefore contacted them again.
We originally reported ourselves already half a year ago.
Always as smooth as peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59. He can charm his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear happiness" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday. But that won't happen either. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official order" to curb the spread of the corona virus.
Other planned appearances by Max Raabe during Advent must also fall by the wayside, as it says on the singer's website and that of his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de). The artists plan to make up for the already postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic from January onwards. Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962 in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, and has been singing a lot and happily since his youth.
In Berlin studied he Operngesang, 1986 founded he together with Kommilitonen the Palast Orchester. Since then has the Bariton with his Repertoire aus Schlagern und Chansons im Stil der Comedian Harmonists etabliert sich. Er wurde vielfach mit Preisen ausgezeichnet.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to break out of the niche and make it into the mainstream. Always elegantly dressed, with neatly combed blonde hair and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer thinkable from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance? It could be combined with existing furniture and so we could control whether it matches in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only sew the cover, but I can't turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create any new apartments The new Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment complexes as demanded in a referendum in Berlin. "With expropriation, no single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years. A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations, by the way, is the best protection against monopolistic tendencies. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission to deal with the consequences of the people's vote.
But if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz just concluded talks with the FDP in the Ampel coalition about further tightening of the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rental index. I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not improve, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and only realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process. Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or will it come again? #PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great! Then I'll solve it independently in the new order. Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut myself on the finger. That is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead from tornadoes in Kentucky A devastating storm system has drawn numerous tornadoes across the United States. Alone in Kentucky, there could be more than 100 dead.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone. In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the USA and possibly up to a hundred fatalities. The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer long trail of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - all gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is possible. He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official numbers increase hourly.
Hello, I have just seen that Vitrine #NAME# is out of stock. That is very unfortunate. Will it still be produced?
Is she completely out of stock? Is there the possibility to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when must you report? If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return, and I would like to inquire if it has been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans while the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, Austrian companies have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial bonuses for getting vaccinated. This puts them on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is intended to increase willingness to receive Corona vaccinations.
He has switched companies where he was teased. This does not improve his situation any better than yours. Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year. He obviously didn't stick to his old place and was looking for something else. You can do that too.
And that he didn't find you well back then: naja, it doesn't matter. He didn't even find his job well. There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation into account. That will be legally relevant. I will take a screenshot.
Good day - I am interested in the Boone Dining Table, White. Is it also available in a 230cm size?
We carry all Smeg kitchen appliances and accessories in our online shop, kitchenpoint.de. We generally check the quality and completeness of your order. The new coffee machine from Smeg brings freshly ground coffee into your kitchen or office.
The simple and reduced design, the matte plastic surface in soft colors combined with the milled stainless steel front make the new SMEG coffee machines with milk frother a design object. Corresponding to the reduced design, all functions such as grind size and water volume, as well as the choice between espresso, americano, ristretto, or a mild coffee can be selected with only four buttons. Thanks to the steam arm, specialty drinks such as coffee-milk and milk foam can also be prepared.
Help with first own campaign Boron to greetings! I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on the adventure "Over the Dragon's Pass" and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5. The great bow is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out, and now I am here, writing the introductory adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes have to transport a wagon full of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further development of the story will take place there. A group of goblins is supposed to ambush the hero a few miles from the village and lure them into an ambush. I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, which also falls to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres armed. The goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a narrow path and flank them with three on the left and three on the right, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon. If the heroes are defeated, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf. The cart, of course, is gone. 2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf and two of his servants intervene and help the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is super. How appropriate do you find the Deus ex Machina solution from Solution 2? Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.  Note: I did not expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely consider many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narrative.
I have taken the lamp apart again. And put it back together. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send them back. Can you let the return labels come? Then I can package the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

We have nothing to do with the chair. Suddenly, there was a rip in it and I just sat on it.
Here was the lower part, so to speak, the part with storage space damaged. Will everything be taken away again or only the storage space part?
I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased significantly throughout the season, so I want to vent a bit with this post. Firstly, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to ensure punctual F1 coverage.
Although the schedule was significantly behind due to the delayed start and the crash at the beginning, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Sky UK, on the other hand, broadcast the race until the end.
Despite a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a rule incompetence among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is a possibility for Verstappen. I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on Formula 1 for a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first riddle regarding what is now allowed or prescribed by the rules, both have simply had constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL much better, even though I don't like his constant jokes, which make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one brings total chaos in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, and in the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear from F1TV after the race, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these channels make less advertising during their training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel. Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very scarce and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-speaking broadcaster for Formula 1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to transmit, except for the advertising. So, at least, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For here: #PRS\_ORG#-pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and has not been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and have not received a response. The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, while the second lady told me yesterday that she would check her email and send it, but she never responded.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 2019. One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair). I would appreciate any assistance.
Fan pumps are ideal for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air pump. This series is offered in three variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can see the performances in comparison. If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire systems with them.
Does one have a large aquarium? Pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outflows. The MK series has 1, 2, or 4 outlets, depending on the model. However, blower pumps are also available in the series to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (available in our shop) or with decorations that convert the air bubbles into a function, such as a treasure chest, shell, or similar.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, which ensures low operating noises. The installation is very easy. The fan pump is connected to an exhaust duct using a 4/6 mm air hose... and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed between them. Cut the air hose and place the check valve in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backward, which would cause the water in the basin to flow out through the pump... If the blower pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate a processing time of 3 days on eBay, packages are packed daily and picked up daily as well. Everything runs smoothly and quickly while on the road. We just want to give a heads up so that no one is disappointed, just because it took a bit longer than expected.
It would be like that, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in logistics... of course, here Corona doesn't stop either. Please don't judge immediately, just because the delivery is delayed, it lies exclusively with the parcel services. People naturally like to complain about these services, even though we currently say... they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally. Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Is it also possible to order the legs in a bright color?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV moderator into space. The daughter of the first US astronaut in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers have embarked on a short trip to space. They were transported by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, on Saturday.
The start and landing of the ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas. Under a bright blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly decorated astronauts upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were on the way for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard, who was launched as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each passenger paid for their ticket. Laura Shepard Churchley reminded us after the short flight of the mission her father undertook. He had to work hard and make everything himself during his missions.
She was simply along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic. He would like to return to space as soon as possible, said the host.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height The rocket system "New Shepard" flies mostly automatically. The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight reached a height of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, occasionally experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: At the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman. At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became famous worldwide with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without considering the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should glow permanently in one color or cycle through its entire color palette. When faced with a color change, the light stone retains a light color for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp ensures year-round use outdoors.
In a snowy environment, their light shines particularly well - only with a shorter light duration can be expected when the days are shorter. Please note that no snow should interfere with the function of the solar module in the winter. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can order a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the usage time of your Dekoleuchte.

"Perfect, that's exactly what I need :) do I need to provide anything else? You only need the tracking number in my email?"
Someone who works or studies biochemistry I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject itself quite interesting. Also, being in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical course). I have, of course, also inform
Currently, I am experiencing doubts, particularly concerning my career prospects. On the one hand (Studycheck etc.), one always hears great career opportunities and the profession is said to be highly sought after. On the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and extremely poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would be really interested to know:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary? 3. What have you studied/which training have you completed?
4) Would you do it all again? Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and doing a training to become a female IT specialist.
If you have any experiences to share, please feel free to write about them :)
Extra stress before vacation and holiday weekends This topic came up last week with me. But now I have to use my long weekend to relax from it.
Therefore, now a post. Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our operation. It seems that there is also a lot of stress on weekends and public holidays.
Well, it was like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a half-day off, which is semi-official. So, last week, we had a long four-day weekend.
What happened last week? Stress everywhere. Lots of emails that had to be dealt with before departure, tasks here and there, everything *had* to be done before the long weekend.
...well, yes, well? Because "next week then" sounds so long after so much time has passed and that shouldn't be the case? Or because people want to do so much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also incredibly agitated. What's the point of this self-sacrifice for holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent in their approach. My question is simply: Are we the only ones who are like this, the Swiss? Is this our reformed-evangelical style?
Or do you know it in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't even bought any gifts yet. "The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
You will synchronize with the party by baking cookies and pastries with your son. "I love it," said Catterfeld. But before the enlightened days, she still had a lot to do: "For the first time, I haven't received any gifts yet. I have to get things done now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moulting and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg. NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather defects occurring in aviculture are solely attributable to nutritional errors. Since feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a perfect plumage. For an efficient metabolism, the daily diet must also contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals. The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed and balances it. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be administered easily through drinking water or through the soft food.
Thank you, I have found it. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are it. I received a bed from you. However, there was a problem with one part.
The central beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them. What do we do now? I cannot build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced. The central beam does not fit into the intended bracket. Therefore, I receive new ones.
When will they be sent? No, not the flat ones. Those are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones, they were only too thin.
But that doesn't matter. The important thing is that they fulfill their purpose. With me, they are not flat.
Could I receive this? Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential building fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria. In addition, a estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire seems to have spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation. The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, and the police did not rule out the possibility of an intentional arson.
The Criminal Police (Kripo) in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But then it comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo  Uğur Şahin, the CEO of Biontech, has published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network LinkedIn. Until now, the Biontech chief had not made any public statements about his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination. The illness of a friend has motivated him to do so, he shared with me. Uğur Şahin, CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, has published a photo on social media that shows him receiving a COVID-19 vaccine.
There were false informations on social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated. Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network. "For several months, friends have been pressuring me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated in order to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him. But a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks."
According to Shahin, the school friend and his family have not been vaccinated. He did not ask for the reasons. "The most common reason seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it's better to share personal experiences. An interview with the German Wave is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated. However, the German Wave itself clarified that the video was created in December 2020.
"I am currently not allowed legally to get the vaccine myself," Sahin said at the time. There is prioritization in Germany for vaccinating the vaccine. Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted for a long time - and the BioNTech CEO has allegedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no power and in many cases also no heating. A fire had disabled a transformer station.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours. The lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communities. The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption could be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered support in schools by providing care places and calling for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked the affected people for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very conscious of the fact that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions. We would also like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring efforts, said the head of the primary technology area, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will take some days, as Westnetz technicians were able to only temporarily put some cables back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company statements. Electricity is flowing again. The fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 has reportedly caused significant damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to Westnetz's statements.
Here is the translation of the text from German to English:  "Dort seien aufwendige Reinigungs- und Reparaturarbeiten nötig. Parallel dazu sei eine Anbindung an eine 30.000-Volt-Spannungsebene geschaffen worden. Mit Hilfe dieses Bypasses stehe die Stromversorgung wieder."  In English, the text means:  "There are extensive cleaning and repair works required there. At the same time, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply would be restored."
Since Saturday 6:00 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 PM. Since 10:15 PM, even the last affected by the outage have had electricity.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies have been in operation. The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It's important now for citizens to take care of their neighbors, especially older or lonely people, and to inform the local fire stations if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. Additionally, temporary care places were established in schools for those who could not take care of themselves or required power-dependent medical equipment or were dependent on medical care. According to official statements.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is about the daily newspaper #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the substructure on the tabletop. It's a custom #NAME#. There are three versions of it.
We wanted to get table plates with a diameter of #NUMBER# cm, but we ended up with a diameter of 155 cm.
Today, my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I cannot collapse it and thus shorten it. Can you help me further? Otherwise, I would have to send it back, as it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise.
I would appreciate a feedback.
Yes, that's really easier! Then let's do it this way! Send me the return shipping label by email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat. However, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG# before purchasing.
Should I do this now?
I find such a low discount almost insulting. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic combined: Riiber wins The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää. The duo had to concede defeat again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping event.
Return of the order number #NUMBER# When will the money be refunded to my account?
Yes, we both have made some changes and are using version 4.5... it could be that they have already heard of the problem.
I have directly purchased a book from my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be working fine. However, when I try to open it, I get the message "ups! This document could not be opened."
The file may be faulty and should be reported to the customer service. As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now what? I have to work in between!
To ensure that the color application is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soap and water, rinse them with clear water, and let them dry. Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes. You can do this on the later non-visible inside of the parts or on a yogurt container.
The first stroke on the building component draws the brush evenly stroke by stroke. The slight overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistic-looking areas. A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors. The dark ones could otherwise shine through later. Metallic tones and colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal streaks may occur when they mix with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them. Models can achieve an original appearance through decals or peel-off images.
From national symbols on aircraft to ship names, decals, and license plates on automobiles: Decals give the model the final polish. Bring the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible. An aircraft cockpit can be easier to decorate before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpick are time, patience, and a steady hand when applying decals. Cut each required decal individually and arrange them as needed. Decals are also called water-slide decals because you wet the back side of the decal briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then simply cut the decal a small piece from the paper and place it on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand). While holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Note: Always check first if the decal is sitting correctly before completely peeling it off the paper, so it doesn't stick, wrinkle, or even tear.
Excessive water absorption with a household towel. Caution, not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off. On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Can I get this by email? Also for all 3 packages? Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages with me.
Thank you very much! Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned. Will I have no problem getting it back?
Childbirth treatment with PKV / What is a "insurance case"? Hello everyone, we have been in childbirth treatment for some time now, but when it comes to billing with the PKV, it suddenly becomes an obstacle.
In order: We had the children's wish train at the PKV applied for in advance and received the promise of 3 attempts. The attempts were not in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was accounted for with the PKV. Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and carried out two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet account for these with the PKV. We again applied for the cost coverage with the PKV and were granted three more attempts.
After some further attempts (we have conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones should be covered by the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts. The justification: The remaining 2 attempts of the first promise fall under pregnancy/birth. The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions (AGB), "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when treatment necessity no longer exists." The questions to the experts here: * Who has the right, the health insurance (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or we (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us that with a birth the further attempts fall away? * Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) will not be healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Okay. We won't be placing any more orders with them. If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can certainly pass this on to their manager. This is not competitively viable.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the return was initiated and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first. I can't do anything about it if the wardrobe is completely destroyed when it arrives at my place. Please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote.
It is clear and distinct that the repayment was initiated and I have not yet received a repayment per #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account. We will no longer be doing that.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months. A office chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they should not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to obtain a different type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company as is.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products being advertised with additional hooks that we can unfortunately not find with you? Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films  What exactly is a low-budget film? There is no general definition with precise budget limits. According to Wikipedia, the following applies:  (Note: I couldn't translate the last word of the sentence as it was not specified in the original text.)
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films online, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it? And what might not appeal to you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully equipped two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much. There is no telephone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will give up soon because it simply does not work here. Hello.
A "Half Victory" against Belarus comes at a high cost for the EU, according to political expert Raphael Bossong. The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, but the costs are very high and there are massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus-Poland and Belarus-Lithuania borders, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the conflict sustainably, according to a researcher at the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP). This state of suspension - Belarus is not entirely small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The way of dealing with people at the border is not in harmony with the European Convention on Human Rights, according to Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole has not decided against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights. This development simultaneously weakens the cohesion within the Union.
She seems unable to prevail when a member state insists on doing its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border protection agency, access to its border. Furthermore, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong points out: an agreement on asylum policy will be difficult to achieve because the slogan "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at crossing the border.
According to statements by Poland's Border Guard, meanwhile, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus. 55 migrants were arrested in the night from Saturday to Sunday and taken back to the border, said a spokesperson for the authorities on Sunday. The Polish officials were reportedly attacked by the migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months, or attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU. Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border crossings.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country. EU commissioners also traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure. The most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines, according to Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination, using tough measures and extraterritorial sanctions to operate. Minsk must also consider the domestic costs. The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly passes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has filed a protest after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi. According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest is based on an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, when he is said to have illegally overtaken. A second appeal was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed correctly. Verstappen overtook Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and celebrated his first Formula 1 title. The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase in which the Dutch driver had overtaken a car in front of him.
I will check it. I will speak with the bank and thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag  The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club Freiburg from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, to visit the park for free on this day. As the park announced, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club Freiburg from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were coupons for drinks and sausages. The roller coaster trains were red and white on that day. Foxy, Ed the Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
Already since the early 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits. Fans shining with joy, who have fun together on the roller coaster, confirm this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

I submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and incorrect delivery of cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you need to correct and not all from our household. Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We talked yesterday and agreed that I/Frau #NAME# should receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return shipping label. I have not received this email yet. I would like to bring the package to #PRS\_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he isn't an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything. It's like when a far-right politician says they have nothing against immigrants. You wouldn't believe them, would you?
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself from it, you should just let it be completely. Yes, wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is simply lost. Maybe God created everything. But if you're a creationist, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just filling our heads with nonsense.
And with that, you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like a colleague.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically planar-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion and color aberrations up to the edge of the field of vision. Often, magnifying glasses are marked with enlargement values.
These statements apply only for precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the usage conditions. In order to use your magnifying glass optimally, we ask you to take note of the hints in the table "Technical Data" (see instruction manual in the packaging). Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices - also on telescopes with eyepieces.
By using an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When used under optimal conditions - with the loupe right in front of the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in both German and English).

#PRS\_ORG# will make me do very nice and good service. It took a while until I reached a person, but they were super.
Hello dear #PRS\_ORG# Team, I have already contacted you under customer service with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called something else before. You can't ship from England due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations during the Christmas tree sale. Once a man even had to drive home alone because he couldn't agree with his partner.
Every year, he plants around 2000 pieces for it. The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations. That makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit funny, he says.
And what about the discount coupon? Otherwise, I'll be gone as a customer! At least, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit. And both have their name as a result.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "the spinner," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
We have had a new fiber-optic connection in the house for a few weeks. Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, with a few exceptions, flawlessly received and transmitted at 50 Mbit. The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to it, but the other DLan module, which sends WiFi, receives fewer and fewer of these 500 Mbit as I move further away from it with the module (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet is now even slower with the new fiber-optic connection on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology. This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses here.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with fiber optic cable over the power line? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables throughout the house.
I am truly desperate, which is why I have created an extra account here. Therefore, I would be even more delighted by a response.
When it's time to change the current account Who would have thought that now would be the first rest with current accounts, it is disappointed. While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with various tricks from their customers, the interest-free amounts for negative interest rates are also decreasing.
For example, Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros. Now it has halved the limit and even quadrupled it for savings accounts. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division of Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower freebet rates apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request. Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers". The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros previously, which still applies, as does the limit of 50,000 euros at ING Deutschland.
The currently popular direct bank DKB has reduced the interest-free periods in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. At least: More than 100 banks have already reached a free amount of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros, but there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which have even been granted legal rights in the first instance by the Berlin Regional Court.
Banks are currently discussing whether institutes should create reserves - in case the upper instances declare negative interest rates in principle as unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.
A table plate for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood. However, her life resembles a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was named the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter." For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
"At least, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a single chip from the bag). That their hearts still fly equally to the female and male fans is actually a wonder. Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still looking for the great love."
And the baby wish has been removed from the list. Prior to that, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. That hurt her.
The people who asked me this have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful. I hope that success and fame will also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it. After a driving error and a slight contact with a band, Kimi Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after only a few laps. It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
For the farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 in a Ferrari. He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup event - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot. "I've calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season to reach it by Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he defended against Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by moving up from third to first place. Then he made some changes to the material settings and drove a larger gap on Sunday with 0.30 seconds. With his teammates Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory. The Stuttgart-bound Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner came in second place before this, but this time he finished in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race. "If I knew what he did differently, I would also do it," said Lochner. Nolte won at home - Jamanka on the podium.
Laura Nolte achieved her third season victory in the two-woman bob at home. After finishing only in fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory with her pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday. Two-woman bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
You qualified for the Olympics alongside your first podium finish in this winter. Wiesbaden's Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig. It was super cool for me to get my first podium finish in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama is joining me.
I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the starting point, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized, "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot of stuff around it." Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not quite flawless runs, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I can buy it now!!! What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay it, so I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time to do so. And now it was said that it had expired, which made me very angry.
Look at the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently reduced :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th? There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was was gestern von Ihrer Kollegin abgenommen. Warum ist das heute ein Problem Ich habe Ihnen auch Bilder von der falsch gelieferten Wäre geschickt.
But we still want the shelf module, it's a new and undamaged one, and we don't want to cancel the entire order.
Only today, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear girls and women, I have something I want to write and perhaps it will resonate with one or more of you...
I am 24 years old, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - except that my dog doesn't cry or goes to kindergarten, he is basically my child. My best friend (who I've known since I was 6) is sick, has a second-degree burn from Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with his shower (because my hand is in a band due to a burn). He is also cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) which makes it difficult for me with my needs for affection and love. My dog has just had an upset stomach, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and stroking him.
I live alone with my sister and mother, and she is currently away for a month. Now, of course, there is also housework that falls on us, which we naturally divide between us. But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is currently set up quite well, I am halfway through therapy and am coming along. Not great, but I am coming along and am almost symptom-free. My university is demanding a lot of me right now (for me), I have a written test tomorrow at 3 pm for which I haven't done anything yet, and there's an anatomy lecture scheduled for tomorrow morning for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left there. So, my week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the holidays. Only until the weekend.
Only until... And so it goes on forever. I believe I am just so stressed that I need these mental references, otherwise I pack it in.
Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't seem to do it any other way... Is it the same for you? Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinite gratitude, I can't even express it in words. Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise. I think it also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the entire other color plus surface is scratched and there is a table leg impression. With the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website. We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me? If we switch tables now, will I get another color or something?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#. In the meantime, it was sent twice. However, it was not confirmed.
It was completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and see it as just another subject like math or geography. For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something. How do you feel about it?
Maybe you can also tell stories from your work or study colleagues with different attitudes. Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is useful to separate them. There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity. What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it? To preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?  I would be happy to write in English, as I understand it well. This has been going on for a very long time, and I would prefer to avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a prompt response, at latest by the beginning of next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Hello dear people, I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I believe it is a film for young people. In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it anyway in the real world, there is a young woman. And in the kingdom of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a story emerges. The antagonist is also a soldier from the Empire of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can continue to live. I believe that the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers will fight against each other. If this statement means anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept only on her stomach from Week 1. Fast forward: she's still alive :D Relax.
So a child holds much more than one thinks. Take care that everything around it fits, no cuddly toys, go in often and watch, but no minutes of surveillance. That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows.
Yes, and ours didn't have a sleeping bag, but always a blanket. Watch your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly? Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress? You can deduce from that whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was still common to put children to sleep by laying them on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already "Stammkunde" at your store and have already purchased many articles. But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already contacted a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It is about my wardrobe that arrived the day before (Order Number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#). The right drawer does not fit into the wardrobe.
Please contact me as soon as possible. The drawer is currently not usable.
To make it clear. RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself that not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV. It's just that the politics of this sender have become utterly ridiculous. Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then they still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "One wants to be 'no running billboard'." What is one now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring his billboard to the elite fan. And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people. A crook who lacks empathy and tries to make a profit by renting out exploded rooms. How can all of this be justified?
"Toll if you like, I find it terrifying."
Please call me back, as my delivered wooden table is defective. The body of the table is broken due to the damaged delivery of the #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort blanket or simply for snuggling - My little warm friend is versatile in use. Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warm applications, as cherry kernels absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled manner. The removable inner pillow can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft cushion makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel secure, even if it doesn't go well for them sometimes. The cherry pit cushion with a soft cushion is suitable as a warm-up layer exclusively for the following application areas: Before warming up the cushion on unusual odors, stains or burn marks, check and dispose of them immediately if they are present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the packaging to warm it up beforehand! In a microwave at max. 300 watts for max. 2 minutes (note from the microwave manufacturer!), heat the pillow evenly by shaking it after heating!
After that, lay the inner cushion back into the cover. During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications. Always adhere to the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can lead to damage (fire and burn risk!).
Check if it is allowed to heat corn products in the microwave according to the manufacturer's usage instructions before heating the pillowcase in the microwave. After the heated pillowcase is placed back in the bag, please check the temperature of the pillowcase to see if it is suitable for babies (maximum temperature of 43°C). Do not use the pillowcase for acute and chronic inflammatory, infectious or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood blisters, and open wounds, as well as for persons with reduced pain sensitivity.
Please consult a doctor before using this product if you have existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes, or tumor diseases, or are pregnant. If the seams have opened up and loose kernels have come out, discard the product and the loose kernels immediately and make them inaccessible to children. If this product is applied to babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly controlled during application to prevent overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority in the country where the user is located. The product is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in a machine. Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the Bundesliga. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the cellar.
It's not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach either. Jubilation in Darmstadt after their late win in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after their failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and approximately 3 years old) would no longer charge through my power adapter. This adapter I bought about 5 months ago and should still work.
I thought a power cord alone was sufficient for operation. Error message: the battery is empty and the laptop doesn't start even though the power cord is plugged in. Therefore, I disassembled the battery, but nothing happened there either.
Do you have any ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the internet? Is there something else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like to book the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to the room. How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat height is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? The Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design is the solution! With a capacity of 20 liters, it can easily accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, thanks to the padded FlexFold dividers that securely store them.
And what you still need for everyday objects is well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical approaches in the individually configurable interior. With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The minimalist design is literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to the photo equipment.
It works with two options: conventionally through the flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in Messenger bags. There is a metal locking hook in the closure flap, with suitable anchor bars on the front side of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, firmly riveted, into which the locking hook can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar. If it is relatively empty, take a deeper one. The zipper and hook are also magnetically attached. This way, the backpack can be reliably closed without having to insert the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you, for example, not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel gear.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more details below) and easily separate the contents - and through the two side openings, you can also access it independently. This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while the everyday items remain safely in the left backpack half and do not interfere. Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's raining in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# announced to me yesterday an email of confirmation for the assignment of the contact person by the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table.
Until now, I have not received any message. I kindly request immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support employee, and with none of them did I get further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#.
It is clear when the wardrobe could be delivered again? Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for the help. Have a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture item and not returned it. And I couldn't have guessed that the past year would turn out differently than planned, and I couldn't properly settle and clarify the damage. But I as a customer will not accept the damage.
Red brake rotors are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who knows how to appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions. Red brake rotors are cast and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut). All tuned rotors are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain rotors and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that is tailored to the enlargement of the disc after the properties of the original assembly. The thus manufactured tuned discs ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness. Additional openings also increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and brake blocks.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the land. Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels practically sprang up overnight. Everyone wanted a piece of the country's wealth.
For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the west and wants to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, round up horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas. You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You must outperform your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win. You choose your actions simultaneously, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works for you (known as "Engine Building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments. Coloma is played over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their selection is revealed, and they place their pawns on the appropriate locations. If a location has the most pawns, it receives a lock!
This deactivates half of the location, reducing the possible actions there. Then, the players alternate performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters. Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer turns at the beginning of every round to a new location and thus changes the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once and the year ends. There is a shooting game in which the players have to defend Coloma from angry bandits.
If the players have enough revolver heroes and the bandits are numerically superior, they will receive rewards. However, if they fail, they will receive lower rewards or end up on the graveyard. The game ends after the third shootout, and then the final score is tallied.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm for the shipping method, Warensendung (games included). For everything else, it is usually DPD secured and with shipment tracking (games included, wrapped with bubble wrap and packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can send the cardboard in a cardboard box for an additional fee of 2 euros, so that there are 100% no printing defects.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has surfaced in my Twitter timeline today, and I immediately watched it.
The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about upbringing. Former patients and those with parental authority are now making serious accusations against him.
Please take care of yourselves, the film is difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. Parents and other responsible adults should never, never, never have power over a child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation. Brrr, I still shiver.
Holetschek: Countries discuss elimination of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals The health ministers of the countries plan to decide on a nationwide elimination of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting. "We as countries need clarity quickly on whether and when the testing requirement can fall for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive to be vaccinated," said Holetschek. Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference "already on Tuesday next week." - AFP
Also, ich will die Lampe zurückschicken. Wie gehe ich da am besten vor?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS\_ORG# account. Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred. Purchases can still be made through the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated the contact details. What could this be due to?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, i.e. sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. These occur with an incidence of approximately 1:1000. The most common type is the perception of sounds/voices, which occurs in about 99.9% of cases. Rarely, there is the perception of images, and even more rarely, the perception of pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the birth to protect the child. Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia methods, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me correctly describes Awareness, but u/Nitemarex, by definition, had none. I mistakenly read their comment.
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ help is not available. These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair. That is besides the legal obligation also a standard in the eCommerce area. Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately. In doing so, we also lose some money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to. One more question. The delivery of the goods is stated to be to a room of my choice in the order and on the invoice.
The courier company is called #NAME#. I just called them and they told me that they only deliver to the doorstep - due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor. Will I be contacted?
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97. He gained recognition as a theater critic and as an intendant. Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97. There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older." The shattering diary of a slow farewell from the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life's gratitude."
There are different types of palettes. One of the most common is the European pallet, which is a standardized wooden pallet used mainly as a loading carrier in the European region. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Austrian Federal Statistical Office, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020. The production value was around 79 million euros. It is not recorded how many palettes are imported into Austria annually.

Rolled Beef Tips & Tricks I received some great tips for the perfect goulash a week ago. It was served at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that :) Now I've come to like it and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I will set up a beef fondue for that.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What about the books, or how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#? My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can manage.
The issue is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made. However, the money has not yet been received by me.
Please check there.
Where in the Lübeck space there is still Christmas ham left? For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts. Have you not yet bought any poultry?
Now time is running out. We reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit. With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set the desired level and, on the other hand, adjust the distortion of your sound.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and distortion. As mentioned earlier, you can even create a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL controller when it gets unreasonably loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL controller, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly. An AUX jack can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate pitch shifter. If you want to treat yourself to an additional VFS5 foot switch, you can comfortably call up sounds by foot, switch on/off effect blocks, and adjust the tempo of compatible effects "tap" to the beat. For live use, this is basically indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But have you seen it like this with others? Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back? Since it is too low for over a dining table?
Also, I would also like to send them back. Can you help me with that?
And the wardrobe? Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a discount or a voucher. Under certain circumstances, I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture. However, I don't think it's worth more than 1,000 euros for the items I don't need.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a Premium customer status at your company?
Iran is seeing progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement. According to Iranian statements, progress is being made in the negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement. "Both sides are close to agreeing on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Ali Bagheri, Iran's chief negotiator, to the news agency IRNA on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was no agreement even on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks were resumed on Thursday after a break of almost a week.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations. A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has surpassed Saxony - the free state is now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence. Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country. As the only federal state, the value is above 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence rate above 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence rate nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but remained above the value of 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day. 200 severely ill COVID-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting. In addition, the health authorities have been overburdened for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is not expected until early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the post office, that's it or? here I don't have to do anything else click/enter/fill out anything?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to request that the return be on my own expense. An 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, audacious.
It's time for changes. ###Welcome to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day! #What's the post here?
When one looks at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one can conclude: it does not exist. We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for some months. #Where lies the problem?
Yes, what was the reason? Mostly, it seems to be related to dissatisfaction, how things have turned out here and how we generally feel uncomfortable. In recent days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here are still really looking forward to the MBundestag.
What we need to change At this point, the community around the MBundestag has been asked whether they want to keep this project alive. The spark came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a mess.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community have found each other who want to rebuild the project. However, I also want to expressly invite everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future. We have therefore created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, on which we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things.
You can access the server through this link. Goals: * How should the MBundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we appear to the outside world in the future? * How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system? I am pretty sure I have forgotten some things, but that's not too bad, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let's democratically decide on the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/clumsy for it and is not suitable for my taste. For this, I have already ordered another hanging from you.
I combined it and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope that this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the daily planner #PRS\_ORG# also come in a larger size, such as 240/240 for example?
PRS_ORG must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be collected promptly. And I kindly ask you to arrange for this now. I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as far as possible for collection - they must clarify with PRS_ORG how this can work.
#PRS\_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for the assembly? How long would I have had to obtain it or make a decision about returning it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? Today, I had a conversation with a colleague whom I like very much. She herself has lived as a vegetarian for a while and currently eats meat very rarely, if at all.
I myself was also some years vegetarian before. When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that is, that I have long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction arose on their side, they defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and as vegetarians, they reduced animal suffering. Now I wonder if my answer was too "plump"?
How do you answer the question? I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without wanting it. It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am scheduled to return on the assigned date, but #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return beforehand. Since I cannot be present due to a funeral, this cannot be changed unfortunately. Can you please assign an alternative return date for me?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue is equipped: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the state Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a subsidy decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new equipment vehicle of the Volunteer Fire Department Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security. I am glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein. The equipment van will be used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks both on and under water in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, one permanently counts on increasing deployments: the boom of tourist shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I now hope for help.
Okay, so ist es. Ich würde gerne 3 Artikel aus der Kollektion von #PRS\_ORG# zu Juni bestellen wollen. Kann ich im Bestellvorgang einen Termin eingeben?

Thank you first of all for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive, furthermore, I do not want to go into it! The question of right and left always seems to me to be oversimplified. However, generally speaking, one should say that of course state employees tend to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It's clear to everyone that people in special uniforms and carrying weapons should be attractive to conservatives, but it's also clear that these people may have a hard time dealing with reality. Of course, besides the average white person, you now have many Germans with migrant backgrounds, women, and even homosexuals. I don't mean the exaggerated stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women who don't advertise it if they don't tell you. And you have to rely on these people as well, because they may save your life or put it at risk. But even these marginal groups represent a conservative attitude, meaning they are proud of Germany and feel less abused by excessive left-wing politics, even though this politics is supposedly for them or should make them right. But they just want to be treated normally. Back to the right, of course, the police and military also represent a cross-section of society, and you will also find extreme right-wing views there, but they are not allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-threatening plans, which is completely overblown in the media and anno
Of course, it can happen that even police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad due to negative experiences begin to generalize and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. It can also happen that right-wing sympathizers meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas. Nevertheless, such things are fiercely opposed to my opinion and are countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is also good in my opinion, that we could hardly afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered from the German side. Why should this come from England? When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer deliverable. I have previously chatted with #NAME#. Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket somehow available in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part, which are filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a thing for a longer time. I am very disciplined and organized in my work, I am self-employed, have very little free time, but since my whole life I have been having more trouble than I should to keep my household permanently clean and tidy.
There are always phases in which everything stays where it is, and every now and then it hits me and I clean up and organize. But it's never really like "someone could spontaneously drop by." My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household just loses out to work and laziness.
The kitchen is regularly cleaned because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child? We haven't yet, but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for a longer time.
Because for me, I have no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable. Does one have a greater motivation with children or does one remain lazy? I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and enables almost unrestricted movement freedom. Pre-shaping with special, deeper stamping at the joints for improved movement freedom (at arm and knee bends) The Focea Comfort 4 features an increased covered area by the Flex System 2, more than doubling the comfort provided by the Flex System.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends) high-quality pre-forms in the lower back area and in the step ensure a snug, perfect fit. The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lumbar spine area increases flexibility around the back closure and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection. When positioned on the chest, it provides warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Continuous, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face near the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head cover). Soft, zone located in the collar improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the lining or stitches. Double cuffs with zipper closure at the arm and foot joints connect an inside cuff with a soft, lined neoprene outer cuff.
For increased elasticity and durability when pulling, a 45° insertion at the end of the inner lining. A long zipper closure at the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without a hood. Long G-Lock P back zipper closure (overall without hood) with a metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Tear-resistant closures at arms and legs Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the tear-resistant closures to prevent tearing when excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer pockets are trimmed for greater durability. Edges of the inner pockets are embossed for increased flexibility. The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in place, especially at deeper diving depths (the system is compatible with all common armband computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a self-uncertainty personality disorder? I have received training in the field of software development and have been working as an apprentice for about a year now. Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right fit for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD). This means, roughly speaking, that I don't have a sense of self-worth and as a result, I am shy. I have no problem talking to people on a practical level, but it is very difficult for me to initiate casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as aloof (which I believe has improved somewhat).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as substance abuse counseling or family support. I don't know if the actual workday is as I imagined it, and it's difficult to find information about it online.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems for me in my job (for me, emotionally) because it always pulls me down when there are issues with my code ("just the simplest things are messed up") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do it"/"he's holding me back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm underqualified" etc.). I will probably have these problems in any job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup. What do you mean by "returning please"?
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, does the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book" appear?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein contained in the food (Protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual amino acids, which it then uses to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal. Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as otherwise disruptions in the breeding cycle may occur.  Translation:  Das mit dem Futter aufgenommene Eiweiß (Protein) zerlegt der Vogel in seinem Magen-Darm-Trakt in die einzelnen Eiweißbaustoffe (Aminosäuren) und baut aus diesen wiederum seine körpereigenen Eiweißstoffe auf, welche er auch zur Gefiederbildung benötigt.

Following the curative gift of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be resumed. The protein taken with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into the individual amino acids, which it then uses to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it may cause disruptions in the breeding process. After the short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be followed by daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement). 1 g of NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml of water or 100 g of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water and soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water and food daily. A teaspoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. If there are severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is fully completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break down after 9 months? The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is truly very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged when it arrived and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree needs to be felled. Therefore, a felling application has been made to the community. An employee writes me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the regulations.
But in the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree. Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not? On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear. Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message. Well, then I still have a sofo without use. Could you offer me a discount or a coupon?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that's correct. The question is whether I can pay in euros and have the deed delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Emergency Report: Serious Traffic Accident in Selb A serious traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the exit ramp Selb-Nord and Plößberg. As currently reported by the police press alert (14:03 Uhr), a car came into the opposite lane while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Okay, I understand. Great, then thank you again that it was so easy!
First, happy Christmas to you! My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I start ranting here, let me summarize: I need advice, and the best people to give it to me are those who somehow understand my situation - in other words, you guys. I'm currently in the process of switching careers, and I'm doing it as a newcomer. Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field as well (to at least have some anonymity, I won't mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun. Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that's what I wanted - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me. I'm now at the third "I Google other job advertisements" stage.
And it's only been half a year. At the paintings before that, I always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I could always turn back. But now I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now it's the holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me. Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my day off was my day off.
Then I was free. And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now, even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me. Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback. But I'm completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had the freedom to take time off when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, it was appropriately compensated and I accomplished something as part of a team rather than as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now. But then I wonder if I will be back at the same place in a year's time like now and be unfulfilled. You can see, it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps you as outsiders have some advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation that I am completely finished with and practically start crying at the thought of it.
I will not make any decisions now, as I am feeling very emotional, which is likely to lead to nothing good. But perhaps your views can help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now. Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone of my writing.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has constantly evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Also do auch diese Amps den mehrstufigen Valvetronix-Röhrenvorverstärker enthalten. Dieser beruht teilweise auf echten analogen Schaltungen, weil diese die Klangvariationen und Nuancen eines Röhrenverstärkers einfach besser hinbekommen als jede Simulation. Zusätzlich zu dieser ausgeklügelten Schaltung bieten die VTX-Verstärker ein geschlossenes Gehäuse und ein Bassreflexsystem, aus dem die natürlichen Resonanzen nur so sprudeln.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined it. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the compression and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During a detailed analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also highly adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable Velcro closure components, it is tailored entirely to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-format mirrorless cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens. A possible equipment could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a spare flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for more lenses. Additionally, one can still store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items.
Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro drone including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday. So far, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island before the west coast of Africa. No reliable data are available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make any predictions as to when it might end. The indicators point towards a slowdown. The best news is that they are stable, said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Millions of euros in damages In the three months since the eruption began, more than 1,000 degree Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
Almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros. Two new land masses were created off the coast, with a total area of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation on the island, which is of immense importance to the approximately 85,000 inhabitants and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption, was particularly affected. About half of the island's population directly or indirectly depends on banana cultivation, and 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, with further areas also severely affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts  Christmas is at the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive charm combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-making "society contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition. How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it were the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift-giving. Prior to that, gifts were exchanged on Saint Nicholas' Day. The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women at night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with presents emerged. Protestants object to this custom because they reject the role of intermediaries between God and humans as "holy veneration." For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new tradition line. The focus of gift-giving shifted towards Christmas Eve as a result. However, since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only annoys a few people that the custom of Saint Nicholas is still as firmly established as the Martin custom of singing and the Martin procession during the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one finds everything one's heart desires in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches. The diversity of traditions in Christian countries confirms a tradition of giving on the feast day of St. Nicholas, which dates back to the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve. However, there is a festive confusion in all Christian-influenced countries about who brings the gifts to the children now. In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas man, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some unique characteristics have been assigned over time.
Examples include his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who showed them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought considerable fame. Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh. In Czechia, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace in London. On Saturday, an armed man was shot by the police near the Kensington Palace in London. The police reported that callers had reported a man with a weapon who had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled according to official statements in a vehicle that was later stopped by police. Shots may have been fired and the man may have been hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background. In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages are located. The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Additional members of the royal family also live there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your site.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area, or stone garden. The light is simply placed and can be anchored with two earth spikes in the ground. An integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration of 10 hours - The robust plastic enclosure is suitable for year-round use in outdoor environments. In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with vibrant colors.
However, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: It is the sun that ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or in color (in six different color tones). The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a large pebble shaped by nature, this modern light object presents itself during the day. Its organic round shapes fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone garden.
He also makes himself useful in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size. You can save a lot of work: as a solar lamp, "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries. Just set the "Light Stone" on any sunny spot during the day.
Two included earth spikes provide a secure hold when needed. The matte white plastic housing itself is robust and weatherproof. The solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colorful light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing. When twilight sets in, "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; in which color, that's up to you: You have six attractive light colors to choose from - besides white for daylight - to set the mood. The battery also turns off automatically as soon as the charging stand drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun comes out again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I have already done it multiple times, and it has not worked.
Sorry, I would have liked to place another order with you, but if the coupon is not credited to me, then I will not place any more orders as a matter of principle. If you think about it differently, please let me know. Otherwise, today was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard. In the lockdown, no hardware store has opened...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been further fundamentally improved. A variably adjustable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures super-quiet operation with bell-crank motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past. The current regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic measurement of the decoder to the motor. The LokSound 5 Decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current, which is sufficient even for older motors. Please use the Ebay shopping cart so that the shipping costs are correctly combined.

Hello dear women's community, I hope I'm doing everything right. It's actually my first post after a year.
To my problem: I have been forced to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pain during my period and PMS before the period. Now I would like to stay away from it again because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100, I suddenly got explosive acne all over my body. It was so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel well. The whole thing never really normalized during the two-year break.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this. My cosmetics are already parfum-free and without any fuss, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me. My gynecologist unfortunately did not take me seriously and the dermatologist's appointment has not yet been scheduled.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, the love of one's skin is such a thing. I had severe prebupertär neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread knötchenflechte and the topic of acne.
I have also tried various forms of nutrition during my Christian illness, and I have remained on a sugar-free, milk-free, and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else worked properly. It can also be good that hormonally there may be a worm in there, but when you want to build everywhere like I do, it's better not to look for it anymore, as otherwise everything goes wrong.
I had already written everything about her colleague's seminar o. ä. and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern. I have to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money were there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.

In the name of the people: Laypeople sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench in the courtroom. But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear a robe: Jurors decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone will go behind bars.
Two of them report in a conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht at John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately, I cannot access the customer account. Could you please send the invoice for order number #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the material of the packaging? We do not have the possibility to keep it for so long. We would use the table as if it were ours, as it is offered to us.
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the translation:  "Gerne, habe bereits im November den selben Sessel in Blau bestellt und auch erhalten. Daher, weil die so schön sind jetzt, einen in Grau."
Must the shelf be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
A new 110-kV earth cable will be built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding. The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria opens the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has announced that it will lay a 7-kilometer long underground cable. The cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a transmission tower of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part so far. The blue order number #PRS\_ORG# with the shipping number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible. Can you tell me how the further process is now? Have a great start to the week!
You can forget about it, I have already explained it several times yesterday! It is a glass commode, and all the sides are inflated, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken. The commode is in my apartment, and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come in because of #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
That means that the wardrobe cannot be taken away because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request was made at #PRS_ORG#, as it probably involves a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues,  I have been working in the reference room (EK) since summer and enjoy teaching, but I currently have big problems with time-efficient planning of my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the schoolbook, and an OHP as media. In the school, I can also only copy in black and white for free (which is a nuisance for geography). I currently need very long to plan my lessons.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and at my school, each hour stands for itself. Essentially, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (I also need that time for UBs, etc.). When planning, I always start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and think about how to build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied. Therefore, also the worksheets. Perhaps one day a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
"Würde mich echt freuen" is a German phrase that translates to "Would really please me" in English.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. While I have actually chosen a new one from #PRS\_ORG#, I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for Christmas business. In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered are allowed. The trade considers this to be unnecessary and regrets sales losses.
He also has a possible solution ready. The 2G rules damage the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE) for the retail trade. The HDE's main business manager, Stefan Genth, criticized that there would be losses in turnover for businesses with articles of non-daily needs.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year. Many had already written off the Christmas business. "What was supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often just an empty hole without any ground," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions lost almost a third of their sales in the past week. However, things are going well in the food retail sector as well as in the online area. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director. "2G shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations repel customers and require a high personnel deployment.
The bandage rule should be approved nationwide, he demanded. After that, each customer should only need to be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and should have access to all businesses with the band they received on that day. Additionally, in retail - as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - sample control checks should be sufficient.
Even the real estate company specialized in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona levels, and the sales at about 90%. These numbers are now sure to fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approvals obtained for the centers. This includes the so-called "bracelet solution," where "visitors, for example, would once present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to that in a club hotel - be able to enter all shops unrestricted." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error with the frame that was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler. It doesn't look very nice.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it. How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance construction based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color rendering. For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is used. In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker. The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent. By the way, it is also suitable for reporters in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness of the light practically without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work with both on set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery scope).
Applicator memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To implement the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press the memory button longer and it is done. The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when the lamp is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.  Translation:  The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.

The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when the lamp is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. This is due to the ability to operate the device with inexpensive NP-F batteries. These batteries are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also be checked beforehand to see if the batteries have sufficient power - it is a built-in battery tester. There are values for each of the two battery compartments in the two display shows (the upper display for the left battery compartment, the lower display for the right battery compartment).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the flash with power through the included power supply. The construction of the flash is very simple. You have a 16mm thread for attachment, which allows you to attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using adjustment screws on both sides. It was important to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and, as a result, are designed for durability and heavy use. Additionally, an inclination joint is included in the delivery scope.
Great, the delivery includes a bag. So you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, die wir schmeißen wollten": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt. After 22 minutes, it seemed that the last twice-winless Hesse were on their way to another Bundesliga disaster.
But then the SGE turned around and within an hour, the frustration from a mediocre season start was thrown off and they won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have achieved today," jubilated coach Oliver Glasner to DAZN and gave a "general compliment to everyone who was involved." It initially looked like another dampener for the Frankfurt team, who are still behind their expectations in ninth place. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2-0.
What then happened, even impressed the SGE trainer. "How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued. I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game due to his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I believe our mental attitude is incredible," said the 27-year-old, who was particularly pleased with the result for the fans. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but is also well-positioned in terms of personnel. It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December and that all players are in top physical condition. It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now we want to "take it step by step and stay humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level". Next, there is already a away game scheduled for Wednesday as part of the English week against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky).
I will receive a grade because my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part. I have tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and have it redirected, but there is no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again, or must I wait until the money is refunded and the order is resubmitted?
For me, it would be unfortunate if it meant that I wouldn't order anymore because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Dampfer for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain Germany's handball women slipped after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks from the court. At the end of the WM main round, the DHB selection suffered a harsh defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," coach Henk Groener judged. Against Spain, we must act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in Group III with 8:2 points behind Denmark (10:0).
It's unfortunate that we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, a significant improvement is needed on Wednesday against the 2019 World Cup runner-up to keep the delicate dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
Dear German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," admitted backcourt player Xenia Smits and demanded: "We must now quickly look ahead." From front to back not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not on top at the start of the match. Poor throws and technical errors in attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on full alert and prevented worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counterattack. However, this was not the desired initial spark. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an appearance - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game ended prematurely at 3:10 after just 20 minutes, due to a hard foul by Mia Zschocke on her opponent, which resulted in a red card for her. However, she will be allowed to participate in the quarterfinals. The German handball team only started to play better in the final phase of the first half and managed to get within five goals of their opponents before the break.
The already quiet hope for a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes in the 9:19 game. Again, the Green-trained shooters sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who counts among the medal candidates at the end of the season. As a result, the German team could no longer muster a performance improvement and had to leave the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season  As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have captured St. Nicholas Day and are using it as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays. How about you?
How about your partner? Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is the best for the children?
The translation of the text from German to English is:  Shoe cleaning? Plate baking? Tree decorating?
Will you be playing music? Will Santa Claus, the Christ child, or are the gifts from Oma and Opa? It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone gives themselves and around Christmas, it's hard to have a beautiful family time.
Is it now a fixed tradition, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Please send me a transaction number, or otherwise, what could help with the transfer confirmation... etc.
I would like to give a discount code away, just like at #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers. How does it work there?
The title exists before, I am active as a mobile vaccination doctor, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these will soon be completed to a large extent, it goes partly to me in vaccination centers. I am happy to answer questions without a time limit on organizational and human aspects and also medical questions, as long as they are not personally oriented (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination...").
In my responsibilities falls the education for vaccination, the indication (the person has a claim to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me). The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants. However, in vaccination teams, we often do not have them, but only pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who cannot perform vaccinations (should they?), so that I also perform most of the vaccinations there myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberg knows the solution. What please is an "Huidlerer"? With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, hefty thinking has been aroused in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern".
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time. No, it was not a "nervous person". And neither was it someone "who everything has to go quickly for".
The people heard from the TV moderator that it was completely wrong. On which the man from Amberg provided the solution and probably also caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate people. "The Huidlerer," the viewers learned, "is a cloth used to wipe the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this. With the comment that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern". With which a gap in education was closed - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy any books for the past two weeks. After confirmation, the following error message always appears: "oops - something went wrong - try again later." I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# service, connected it to the PC, synchronized, and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - is it really as safe as they say? I've been eagerly awaiting today, as I wanted to train a bit for my upcoming cycling tour next week. So, I said and did it, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened. Glass shards on the route. Zack, loud hissing, and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the way.
Since I couldn't really buy a replacement jacket and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't quite as bad as it sounds, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour. But now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would really hate to have this problem frequently. Now it wasn't that bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had driven until 2:12 PM on the day I picked up the bike and covered 140km!) were still on the bike, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had driven many years on them. However, when I think that I still need to change the tires after 80-90km, I am not in a good mood: D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the platform, who surprised me by asking why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbeatable. Now it all sounds very tempting. But are they really so indestructible?
I don't want to spend 40€/rear tire right now, just to be disappointed later. Furthermore, I wonder: I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike. Although it is also available (apparently) for Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend other tires to me for a racing bike? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! I would rather recommend the Durano DD to those with less knowledge.
Thank you already in advance for the help and loving greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and collided with a central reservation.

Hello everyone,  Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST this year! Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
"ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be able to stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow us! > We will do our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible."
It will be around 0:30 when it happens. Prepare your drinks in advance, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
