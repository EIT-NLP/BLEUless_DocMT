Four days of national mourning were declared in his honor.

De Klerk also shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Mandela in 1993 after freeing him from prison in 1990.

Critics say he remains inseparable from apartheid-era crimes and could have been held accountable for them had he lived longer.

Outside the church, a small group of protesters held signs saying, "Justice denied" and "Justice for apartheid victims" and were swiftly led away by police.

Avalanche at Washington state ski resort kills 1, traps 5 An avalanche swept through part of a Washington state ski resort used to access backcountry skiing on Saturday, killing a 60-year-old man and temporarily trapping five others. The avalanche was reported about 10:50 a.m. in the Silver Basin area of Crystal Mountain, which is located about 85 miles (137 kilometers) southeast of Seattle, said Pierce County Sheriff's Department Sgt.

While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.

It also makes for some terrible UX. Even if Apple upped the rate of OS updates to account for minor bug fixes in a handful of apps, why does the user need to perform *a full OS upgrade* every time?

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.

ASSISTANT: Gabba的双重电力故障解释及其可能再次发生的原因 Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 主要和备用发电机为全球广播Gabba测试提供电力时，在第四天晚上约25分钟内停电。这是因为广场内的基础电力需要为Gabba的照明楼提供电力，其中一个在2019年的Big Bash League比赛中著名的照明楼出现故障。此外，球场本身也需要电力。因此，主要的电力供应来自于一台巨大的柴油发电机，备用电力应该来自于备用发电机。

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.

ASSISTANT: 不过，在比赛的第四天，主发电机故障与备用发电机同时失效，导致两者都下线，并且造成了近30分钟的全部或部分广播图像和DRS的损失。NEP公司，提供Fox和Seven使用的外部广播车和其他设施的公司，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。所有其他用于板球比赛的场地——阿德莱德奥林匹克公园、墨尔本大球场、悉尼奥林匹克公园和霍巴特的弗雷泽奥林匹克公园——将提供主线电源作为主要供应，留下一

This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: 这个差异，过去给主播电视网Fox Cricket带来了很大的焦虑，在板球比赛的过程中，由于技术和制作人员数量大幅减少，使得许多象征性的球都需要在整个比赛中保持平衡。Fox Cricket警告Cricket Australia，如果在技术上保持安全的话，最好在其他地方举办比赛，但如果在凯柏酒店举办比赛，那么允许进入昆士兰州的骨骼团队将存在“巨大的风险”。

Germany's regulator has suspended the approval procedure for the completed pipeline because of legal issues.

POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.

Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.

ASSISTANT: 目前，韩国 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 正在使用三种方法来检测 COVID-19 变异株：整个基因组分析、目标DNA（包括刺突蛋白等变异）分析和 PCR 测试。对于 Delta 变异株，目前的 PCR 测试可以检测到它，但对 Omicron 变异株无法检测到。这次开发的技术不是一种读取DNA或RNA序列的测序方法，而是分子诊断技术。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.

ASSISTANT: 现有技术仅对病毒的特定区域进行检测，而分子诊断技术是设计用于仅在COVID-19 RNA存在时引起核苷酸结合反应的。据李教授介绍，奥米克рон在PCR测试中具有强烈的N基因信号，但具有弱信号的S基因。在“隐形奥米克рон”的情况下，N和S基因都确认为阳性，使其难以与其他变体区分开来。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.

ASSISTANT: 分子诊断技术与PCR有不同的作用机制，能够高效地检测Omicron变异株。与传统技术不同，它通常可以处理96个样本/设备，而新技术可以在30分钟内处理超过125个样本（每小时超过250个样本）。此外，这种技术不需要专用设备，因此可以简单地制备诊断套件。

As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future. "I hope the disclosure of this technology will help us return to normal daily life as soon as possible," said Professor Lee. We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.

ASSISTANT: 由于该方法可以在4天内开发出诊断套件，因此预计在未来出现新变种或病毒时仍能够快速响应。“我希望这项技术的披露能帮助我们尽快恢复正常的日常生活，”李教授说。我们将尽快诊断并响应来自COVID-19之后可能出现的新变种。

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.

"I had an idea of Lestat as the man of action, the man who could do things that I couldn't do," Rice said in a talk at Southern Illinois University in 2010. "Interview with the Vampire" was made into a successful feature film in 1994, helping to reignite interest in the vampire genre which continued with the TV series "The Vampire Diaries" and the "Twilight" film series. Although she lived most of her life in California, Rice was a native of New Orleans and set many of her stories there, according to her website biography.
