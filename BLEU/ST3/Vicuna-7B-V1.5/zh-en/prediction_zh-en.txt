ASSISTANT: Feel that it is very meaningful to have a certificate - the first aid certificate is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides the driver's license! Let's popularize it: actually, the first aid measures are emergency rescue measures to be taken in the event of an emergency before the ambulance arrives.

众所周知，在事故发生后救护车来的过程中其实是还有一段时间的，而正是这段时间才是最关键的。这个时候便是需要急救的时候。如果我真的发生了心脏病、脑溢血、呼吸骤停，那么我们生命的窗口只有四分钟，黄金四分钟！

ASSISTANT: Everyone knows that there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the event of an accident. In fact, this is the most critical period. This is the time when immediate rescue is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or stopped breathing, our window of opportunity for survival is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!

ASSISTANT: Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid! When someone falls down near us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is too helpless and terrifying. "In China, official data shows that there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is sudden cardiac arrest."

ASSISTANT: If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no pulse, performing CPR on the person is useless. It is only possible to save the person by performing artificial respiration and chest compressions. I have found that many people nowadays do not have the awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react promptly in emergency situations.

Students who participate in the pilot program will have the status of both apprentices and students, and will be pre-recruited as employees by the pilot enterprises upon graduation. The Education Commission requires that the admission and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise employees be clarified. According to the principle of mutual selection, vocational school students, schools, and enterprises will sign a tripartite agreement, and for students who have not yet reached the age of 18 and are less than 16 years old, the agreement must be signed by the student, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement will specify the rights and obligations of each party, as well as the specific positions, curriculum, and benefits guaranteed for the apprentices during their on-the-job training.

ASSISTANT: The trial period is set as an experimental period for cultivating the curriculum, and the duration of the internship in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. The top internship generally lasts for 6 months. In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, 1 teacher can lead 2-5 students to form a learning group, ensuring that each student is proficient in the skills required for each job rotation. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern apprenticeship trial points, with each trial point having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be cultivated.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。

ASSISTANT: A South African doctor: Although the transmission power of the Omikron variant is strong, it mainly affects mild cases in South Africa. Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of the Omikron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province have formed a doctor organization and reported that the patients they are currently treating for COVID-19 have relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.

ASSISTANT: The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees about 30 patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.

ASSISTANT: He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta variant of COVID-19, the patients he treated for COVID-19 in this wave "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation levels. Many people needed to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in the southern African region, other doctors also shared similar experiences.

ASSISTANT: Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks of time, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among the recent COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% died, while the death rate in the early cases in South Africa was 20%.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。

ASSISTANT: "I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a coach with a similar price first. It's not friendly, and in fact, the price often corresponds to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive coaching will be more friendly than cheap coaching. This type of 'entry-level coaching' is actually industrial waste. They have low strength, and when you hit the racket on them, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control them."

它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

ASSISTANT: The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll make something cheap and sloppy for you to play with, you'll play twice and never play again, this cheap shot is good for you, and you won't feel bad. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've improved, and when you come back here to buy something expensive, I'll make twice as much money. It's recommended to spend similar money on a second-hand good racket, choose Prince or Tuo Le Ping, these two brands are not very famous, so good rackets are not sold at a high price, a new one costs 500-600, a second-hand one costs 200, don't you think it's enjoyable to have a thousand-dollar racket?

江西３年内将培训万名乡村小学音体美教师-新华网新华社南昌５月２２日电（记者陈毓珊）记者近日从江西省教育厅获悉，为增强紧缺学科教师队伍保障能力，实现乡村义务教育均衡发展，自２０１６年起，江西省规划用３年时间为全省乡村（乡镇及以下）每所小学培训合格的音乐、美术、体育教师各１名，共计１万名。据了解，这次培训对象为江西全省乡村小学４５岁以下具有音乐、美术、体育学科知识基础或才能，能兼任音乐、美术、体育课程的其他学科教师。

ASSISTANT: According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Jiangxi Province plans to train 10,000 rural primary school music, art, and physical education teachers within the next three years to ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas. Starting from 2016, Jiangxi Province will train one music, art, and physical education teacher for each rural primary school in the province, with a total of 10,000 teachers to be trained. The training will last for three years, and the target audience is rural primary school teachers who are 45 years old or younger and have a basic knowledge or skills in music, art, and physical education, and can also teach other subjects.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通过培训，使他们掌握音体美学科教学的基本知识和教学技能，更新教学思想和观念，掌握现代教学方法，提高学科教学能力、活动设计能力、校园文化能力及自我发展能力，建设一支一专多能的音体美教师队伍，缓解乡村音体美教师缺乏的问题。为确保培训质量和效果，江西还规划为全省１００个县（市、区）小学音乐、美术、体育各培训１名，共计３００名培训者，全面提升他们的教学示范引领能力、教研活动设计组织能力、施训能力、网络研修工作坊建设能力，起到教授、示范、指导、监督的作用。

ASSISTANT: Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of vocal music aesthetics, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, build a team of multi-skilled vocal music teachers, and alleviate the problem of insufficient number of rural vocal music teachers. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to train one person in music, art, and sports in each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, a total of 300 trainees, and comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leading ability, teaching research activity design ability, teaching ability, and network training workshop construction ability, playing the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。

ASSISTANT: Actually, there are many discussions about what to wear for girls with a slim body. For girls with a fat body, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the difference in length should be around the knee, so that it can cover the fat thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat thighs above the knee.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。

ASSISTANT: Wearing clothes that are too long can give people the impression of being short and fat. If you wear clothes that are divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, you will appear taller, as different colors are used for the top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt. This will give the impression of being taller. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard issue for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are a good way to hide your body fat. High-class black shorts are also the first choice for chubby girls.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。

ASSISTANT: Wearing deep-colored clothing, especially a black short skirt, will make you look thinner. If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably. The more popular the color, the better.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make yourself feel fat. For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to learn how to dress properly. Do not wear tight short skirts, and do not wear tops that are too short or stuffed inside the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black long socks or mesh socks (with a fine grid pattern, please), choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match it with a shirt with a ruffled collar. This can effectively cover the shortcomings of overweight girls.

当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。短裙搭配高跟鞋，可以让你的双腿显得更为修长，这可是夏季最IN的搭配喔!

ASSISTANT: Of course, it's also important for chubby girls to wear short skirts. When chubby girls wear short skirts, they should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make their chubby figure look taller. Wearing short skirts with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look more slender, which is the hottest summer style!

ASSISTANT: If you are overweight but have skinny legs as an MM, I recommend choosing a beautifully designed midi dress. Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A-line dresses are very slimming and are suitable for overweight girls. When choosing the top, it's best to opt for something that's a bit form-fitting to create a layered effect, which will make you look even slimmer.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。

ASSISTANT: A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington D.C. on the same day.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: The chairman of this group, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has doubled, but in these three top American universities, the proportion of Asians remains basically the same. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the "holistic consideration" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the admission rate for Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。他们也期望被投诉高校能够主动重视这一问题，改变对亚裔的招生政策。

ASSISTANT: The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that they hope to submit a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action after the fact to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions. They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.

目前，被投诉的３所高校尚未作出回应。亚裔教育联盟成立于２０１５年，当时曾投诉哈佛大学招生歧视，但美国教育部以程序理由未予受理。此次参与申诉的除美国华裔团体外，还包括美国印度裔、韩裔、日裔、巴基斯坦裔教育团体。

ASSISTANT: Currently, the three schools that have been complained about have not made any responses. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices. However, the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the complaint, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education organizations that participated in the complaint.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory building located in Shaoxing, Yongjia, Zhejiang from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory building. In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring money through a bank. Ms. Lin signed the "Factory Building Sale and Purchase Agreement" as the payee, and it was stipulated in the agreement that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would belong to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer doubled. Both parties agreed to sign the factory building sale and purchase agreement within a week.

然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as factory building sales range and payment methods, the house purchase and sale contract was delayed again and again. Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu. After a long search, Mr. Liu finally found a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu feel helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。一审判决后，原告提起上诉。

ASSISTANT: For this reason, Mr. Lin sued Mr. Wang to the Yuyang City People's Court. The court, after hearing, considered that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. Therefore, it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply the penalty of double return of deposit. The defendant did not need to bear the breach of contract liability for returning the deposit twice. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.

ASSISTANT: Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict. [Legal advisor] In the course of trade, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of prudence and caution. As a buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of prudence and caution when signing a contract, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information. It is also necessary to clearly specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。

ASSISTANT: In Sabah, 3,200 newborn babies have yet to receive their birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the stock of anti-forgery paper was used up for other purposes, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October. The number of affected individuals has reached 3,200 to date. However, the department's director, Kharudin Amins, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and that they will be issued once the anti-forgery paper arrives next week.

ASSISTANT: He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRU Amirullah revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has already arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。

ASSISTANT: The National Defense and Epidemic Prevention Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in border cities. It requires that people who need to leave the land border cities (excluding those with Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours must have a 48-hour nucleic acid test negative certificate, and after arriving in the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, region, and city and the announcement of the border city range to March 15, 2022.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, cities along the border can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdiction. The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office responsible person introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar for the local area, and people from both sides travel back and forth frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies, which was originally a single line of defense, can become two lines of defense, with the hope of achieving pre-emptive control and compressing the risk of epidemic spread, thus achieving the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。

ASSISTANT: Recently, there have been many local outbreaks of the epidemic in China, all of which are imported from abroad through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems in the monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk positions, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain logistics, the irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made from nine aspects, including completing the mechanisms for border city epidemic prevention and control, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the management of centralized isolation sites. We must not relax our guard, do scientific and precise work in epidemic prevention and control, and tighten the defenses at the border to prevent the import of epidemics.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: The notice emphasizes that cities along the coast should synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the guarantee of basic living needs, and publish and widely disseminate the hotline for basic living needs guarantee. It should regularly inspect the supply and price of basic living necessities, and promptly solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the public. According to the notice, the cities along the coast include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (autonomous regions, municipalities), and directly-administered cities located at the land, water, and air ports. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

不要把人吓倒在起跑线-新华网逛书市时，往往能感受到成功学类书籍的火爆。现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。

ASSISTANT: Don't knock people down at the starting line - when browsing books on the internet, you can often feel the explosion of success books. Today's success books often claim to be "the best principles" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。

ASSISTANT: Translation:

It's equivalent to saying that you've gone beyond the "how to do it" phase, which is actually the most important and fundamental step. Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either you do it to the best of your ability or you don't do it at all; either you're at 100 or you're at 0; either you climb the mountain or you wait patiently at the starting line. This "best principle" makes everyone acknowledge that it is "absolutely correct," but 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。

ASSISTANT: Because this theory advocates a path of "you need to make a decision, turn over a new leaf, and embark on a 180-degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people. For those who are rigid in their ways, stuck in the past, and resistant to change, you would do well to shout "you need to transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano. Most people would tremble at the mere mention of "transformation," hedge their bets, and find it difficult to make a decision; or else, they would make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and boldly take the first step, only to find that the scenery doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for long.

ASSISTANT: The famous "From Tomorrow" song by Mr. Ma Sanlitun is a classic that best illustrates the "universal human nature" of this "best principle". The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, causing most people to "knock on the door in awe". Perhaps a "second-best principle" is a possible way for more ordinary people to take a relative path to success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。

ASSISTANT: The core of "次好原则" lies in "reducing the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "striving for small victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand hill in front of your house, because it's stronger than standing still. In short, whatever you do, it's stronger than not doing it. With the threshold greatly reduced, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and once you persevere, the chance of success will also increase.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: Only by following the "second best principle" can the successful path be slightly longer. In summary, although the "best principle" flies the flag of making everyone successful on the surface, it ultimately only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。

ASSISTANT: The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province. The current resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake is 10.85 million tons, an increase of 40% compared to the initial protection period in 2002. Qinghai Lake is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to the lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as large-scale killing, overpopulation of carp, and deterioration of the aquatic environment, the number of carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake carp was listed in the "Red List of Endangered Species in China". Since 2003, the Qinghai Provincial Government has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any unit, organization, or individual from catching, selling, or trading Qinghai Lake carp and its products.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。

ASSISTANT: At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release of fish and the cleaning of the main inflow and outflow rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages," measures have been continuously strengthened to protect Qinghai Lake. The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased year by year through these measures. Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau deputy director Yang Lin introduced that as of now, Qinghai Lake has implemented artificial breeding and release of fish for nearly 1.8 billion fish, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources. The Three Rivers Source Area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。

ASSISTANT: Is it because the bathtub is leaking electricity? Choosing an appropriate bathtub can have a good therapeutic effect on your feet. Today, the country's small editor will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。

ASSISTANT: On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, healthcare appliances such as foot baths are selling like hotcakes. However, there is no dedicated industry standard for foot baths, which poses a certain safety risk. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation in his soles.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that was causing the sensation in his feet, but he didn't realize that he had turned off the vibration function. Even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store and the store's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。

ASSISTANT: Because he discovered that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the popular bathtub that has been around for a long time, such as how to set the highest temperature, which group of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process. Therefore, it is recommended to choose a disassembled bathtub when purchasing.

中国工程院院士刘仲华教授在开幕式上隆重推介：湖红之源在新化，红茶崛起为“五彩湘茶”注入新动力。近年来，省委、省政府大力支持茶产业发展，推进千亿湘茶产业建设，形成“三湘四水五彩茶”的发展格局。省内茶界加大创新，绿茶、黑茶、红茶等主力茶类轮番发力，主产茶区推进茶旅融合，带动广大茶农增收。

ASSISTANT: Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced solemnly at the opening ceremony: The source of Lushan tea is in Nanchang, and the rising of Longjing tea injects new vitality into "Five-Colored Xiang Tea". In recent years, the provincial committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five Colors of Tea". The tea industry within the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main forces of the tea industry, and the main tea-producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving tea farmers to increase their income.

风水轮流转，红茶又发力。省内茶界专家称，采完绿茶采红茶、黑茶，茶农一年四季有收入，茶园产值直线上升。在开幕式上，省领导为第四批获权使用“湖南红茶”商标的企业进行授牌，新化喜捧“湖红之源 ” 。

ASSISTANT: The wind and water cycle turns, and the red tea gains strength. Provincial tea experts say that after completing the green tea and red tea harvest, the tea farmers have income all year round, and the tea garden's output value continues to rise linearly. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Lake South Red Tea" trademark, and New Hope held the "Lake Red Source".

ASSISTANT: At the Xinhua Red Tea Museum in Fujian, local tea merchants fell in love with a high-mountain tea called "Ice in the Spring". They immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Fujian Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, was pleased to say that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the tea exhibition, the highlights were eye-catching. The Xinhua Red Tea was dyed red and infused with the cultural connotations of tea, and the popularity was great and the trading was hot. The Chaozhou tea industry warmly welcomed the arrival of the new spring.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。

ASSISTANT: A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and it takes six months to learn. But if you plan to enter this industry, training is a good choice, especially for those who lack self-study ability, training is even better.

要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

ASSISTANT: If you have relatively strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is an important thing. Firstly, you need to look at the teacher force of this institution. If the teacher force is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions have not yet built up their teacher force.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before choosing a training institution, investigate the institution itself and its students, because only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not. Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't introduced your situation to me. Learning this and your personal situation are closely related. For example, your profession, age, desired language to learn, and even where you are located can all affect your learning or desired industry.

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

ASSISTANT: If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way, and now there are many offline and online training institutions that are not bad, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is relatively large, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient, as there are many free learning resources on the network, or you can find many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。以上就是我的一些看法，前面说的因为不了解你的情况，所以只大概介绍也并不详细，如果你有其他的想咨询的，可以随时联系我进行交流沟通。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time cost, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teacher's explanations are also very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone specially assigned to answer them. In addition, many training institutions now have employment agreements, and they can recommend you to companies after you finish your studies. This way, when you go for an interview for a job, you can save a lot of trouble. These are my some thoughts. Since I don't know your situation, I can only roughly introduce them. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for consultation and communication.

迪里耶双年展基金会首席执行官巴克利表示，希望本届双年展能够建立国际对话，让全球观众有机会了解沙特蓬勃发展的文化产业和创意社区，加强互动往来。田霏宇说 ： “ 双年展的目标是双重的，既能让沙特当代艺术参与全球对话，也能让沙特观众融入当代艺术世界 。 ”据了解，在双年展开幕周期间还将举办系列讲座，艺术家、策展人和创意行业的意见领袖将就跨文化交流、当代艺术发展等主题展开讨论。

ASSISTANT: The director of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakkali, expressed the hope that this year's biennale would establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the cultural and creative industries of Saudi Arabia and its vibrant creative community, and strengthen interaction and exchange. Tianwei Yu said: "The goal of the biennale is double, allowing Saudi Arabia's contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and also allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." According to reports, a series of lectures will also be held during the opening period of the biennale, with artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net Yunnan Province Kunming December 12th (reporter Lin Bixiong) In order to continue to do a good job in poverty alleviation and promote the all-round development of rural areas, Yunnan Province has recently taken measures to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty reduction, and assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security responsible person introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to provide employment for poverty-stricken labor forces and other difficult groups in rural areas, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment growth, consolidating poverty reduction achievements, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

ASSISTANT: This new regulation was jointly issued by the Department of Ethnic and Religious Affairs, the Rural Revitalization Office, the Ministry of Finance, and six other departments. It mainly regulates the scope of recruitment, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions for public welfare positions at the grassroots level. In terms of position development, the new regulation is clear that positions should be set up according to the principle of "post-based recruitment, personnel-based management, dynamic management, and quota control" and the principles of "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management." The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of advertisement, application, review, announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

ASSISTANT: Although the right-wing has had some glorious times in history, it has not lasted long. The reason why it is short-lived is that it shines brightly when it gets a little bit of sunlight and sweats when it drinks a little bit of water. As soon as it gets a little bit of power, it becomes arrogant and looks down on Sichuan. However, in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in promoting social progress. From the end of the Cultural Revolution to defining the truth, promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection, the right-wing's positive significance should not be denied.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: Three, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that it is unnecessary to overthrow the government, and that revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. Finally, it is the foreigners who take advantage of the situation.

Four, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunists who try to profit from the situation are not right-wingers, but rather troublemakers.

ASSISTANT: Let's talk more about the left. The left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of history and politics. If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has no positive significance because the left is what the Communist Party has discarded!

ASSISTANT: Translation:

V. Recently, I've seen some friends complaining about the other side's thieves and leftists, even getting angry and acting tough. I think it's unnecessary.

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the villain insults you for five cents, and when the left-handed person insults you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but after they became old, they forgot their ideals, or pursued them and ended up as fanatics. As we move further and further away from our ideals, we may even become dragon-slaying youths who ultimately turn into evil dragons.

左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: I generally feel that "left" and "right" refer to constraints and freedom, and China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic inheritance. While domestic right-wingers prioritize freedom and efficiency, left-wingers emphasize regulation and fairness. Nowadays, society as a whole desires greater emphasis on fairness, and with the US-China competition, a left-leaning approach is generally favored, and this trend is likely to continue for many years to come.

来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: When I arrived at the store, a series of tricks began. I was just there to show them my house model, but they didn't even go to measure the house. They were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 7 million, and they basically showed me their materials without knowing what brand they were. Their second trick was that once you hand over the deposit at the store, you'll never be able to get it back (unless you have enough experience and know how to handle disputes with them).

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. I was impulsive and paid over 10,000 yuan in deposit. The quote they gave me had many problems. The price did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom, which are the costs of basic installation.
