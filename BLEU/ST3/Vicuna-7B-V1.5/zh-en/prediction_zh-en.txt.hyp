Is there a way to punish him to prevent such things from happening again?

"好的，麻烦了" is a Chinese phrase that translates to "OK, sorry" in English.
Feel that it is very meaningful to have a certificate - the first aid certificate is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides the driver's license! Let's popularize it: actually, the first aid measures are emergency rescue measures to be taken in the event of an emergency before the ambulance arrives.
Everyone knows that there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the event of an accident. In fact, this is the most critical period. This is the time when immediate rescue is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or stopped breathing, our window of opportunity for survival is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid! When someone falls down near us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is too helpless and terrifying. "In China, official data shows that there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is sudden cardiac arrest."
In the United States, on average, 15% of people can be saved. In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved. In Shanghai and Beijing, less than 1% can be saved. This is what the founder of the first response team, Luo Le, said.
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no pulse, performing CPR on the person is useless. It is only possible to save the person by performing artificial respiration and chest compressions. I have found that many people nowadays do not have the awareness to learn emergency first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can react promptly in emergency situations.
"Maybe I can still save a life! You can register for first aid certification at your local Red Cross center. I registered at the Red Cross center in Zhuhai. There are also student discounts. PS: The last picture is a record of the goal I set for myself 25 years ago, and adding first aid certification to the goal list is something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!"
After that, I plan to take other certifications that I want to take, such as the diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving emergency certification, and it seems that you need to have the emergency certification to take the diving certification. So actually, the emergency certification is still very useful!
I ordered #NUMBER# of them, and the shrimp dumpling costs 13 yuan!? I haven't tried it yet.

Because I saw that the code I input before was valid.

The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission is piloting a modern apprenticeship system in 60 vocational schools this year. Students who participate in the pilot program will have the status of both apprentices and students, and will be pre-recruited as employees by the pilot enterprises upon graduation. The Education Commission requires that the admission and employment procedures of vocational schools be standardized, and that the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise employees be clarified. According to the principle of mutual selection, vocational school students, schools, and enterprises will sign a tripartite agreement, and for students who have not yet reached the age of 18 and are less than 16 years old, the agreement must be signed by the student, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement will specify the rights and obligations of each party, as well as the specific positions, curriculum, and benefits guaranteed for the apprentices during their on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-style training with joint training of enterprise employees before and after transfer. Pilot schools should reform their talent training mode. The school and enterprise should jointly design a talent training plan, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The trial period is set as an experimental period for cultivating the curriculum, and the duration of the internship in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. The top internship generally lasts for 6 months. In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, 1 teacher can lead 2-5 students to form a learning group, ensuring that each student is proficient in the skills required for each job rotation. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 city-level modern apprenticeship trial points, with each trial point having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be cultivated.
According to the principle of gradually expanding from pilot projects, from point to surface, exploring the long-term mechanism of establishing school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated cultivation of talents, and effectively improving students' job skills and increasing their employment rate and job quality.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and finally made a decisive move. The suction effect is not bad, and there is obviously less dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy when held with one hand; the wet wipe needs to be improved, and there will be dust residue when pulled back and forth; overall, it is still a very satisfied cooking machine with a bit of weight. Looking up at it, it is suitable for my small kitchen, and my child says it tastes better than what I cook myself. I have cooked two dishes with meat and vegetables, and the stir-fried spare ribs are particularly delicious. It takes a long time, and other cooking times are very short.

It is really a technology that changes life. The control of fire and seasoning is precise, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the level of a big chef.

The dishes I cooked turned out to be better than what I made, and the stir-fried tomatoes and scrambled eggs tasted particularly delicious. The texture of the eggs was especially good. This wok is worth buying. It's a good deal, and it's worth purchasing. It's excellent.
The overall impression is good, very clear, and consistent with the description. It is worth having. The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and doesn't strain the eyes. I haven't found any other abnormalities except that it's thicker than the current mainstream displays. The bezel is also wider, and the gap between the bezel and the screen is a bit large. However, the display effect is not bad, and the accessories are complete and shipped quickly!
The shop's service attitude is great! I've used it for a while, and the quality is good. The screen resolution is also very clear. The stock trading is fantastic, with a ratio of one to four, it's perfect.
The logistics are fast, the goods are good, buying a second one is definitely a good deal. The display screen has high quality, and it's not because the screen is large that it loses its clarity. The interface is perfect. It feels good, the color restoration is good, and the quality is excellent!

A South African doctor: Although the transmission power of the Omikron variant is strong, it mainly affects mild cases in South Africa. Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms of the Omikron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those of the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster. According to a report by the Associated Press, as the Omikron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province have formed a doctor organization and reported that the patients they are currently treating for COVID-19 have relatively mild symptoms, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees about 30 patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized. Pillay said, "They can control their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He added that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are more likely to develop severe illness from the coronavirus.
He said that compared to the previous wave of the Delta variant of COVID-19, the patients he treated for COVID-19 in this wave "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation levels. Many people needed to be hospitalized within a few days." Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in the southern African region, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks of time, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues. According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among the recent COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay decreased from 8 days to 2.8 days; and in recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% died, while the death rate in the early cases in South Africa was 20%. The director of the Africa Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all the signs indicate that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said: "Now is still the early stage, we need to obtain later data. Usually, the time of hospitalization and death occurs later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks." At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the dominant strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, cases of the Omicron variant have been reported in several countries, with South Africa serving as the epicenter of the outbreak. According to health officials, the number of new cases in the Gauteng province of South Africa increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests have shown that more than 90% of the cases are of the Omicron variant.

Yang Haoteng, from the perspectives of ideological beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youth party, and party leadership and theory, combined with his own insights and personal experiences, he comprehensively and systematically expounded the core meaning and practical requirements of the spirit of the conference and the spirit of the important speeches, instructions, and directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping. He pointed out that it is necessary to integrate the spirit of the conference and the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches on the importance of the spirit of the conference and the spirit of the important speeches and instructions of the provincial party congress, and study and practice them, so as to enhance the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two safeguards", and unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.

Actually, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the rider's mistake. The invoice wasn't included in the delivery bag.
I hope you understand.
"Because the delivery time was faster than displayed by 30 minutes, thank you."
Yes, I've already changed to a new driver. I've been waiting for a long time for that restaurant to process my order.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  等了几个小时  Waited for a few hours.
I have taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is constantly being delayed.
"原来要 #NUMBER# 那总之我不叫了" can be translated to "I didn't call it #NUMBER# originally."
If I don't eat it, I'll definitely complain that you didn't send it on time. How come you didn't mention it earlier?
The Chinese text "等你那么久" can be translated to English as "I'll wait for you that long."
"No, I haven't received the call. Please notify them and have them send it to our company."
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
"A meal has been waiting for half an hour, and the PRS ORG has not sent it to me. I want to cancel the order."
Why not give up?
Hello, the fried chicken sent from the restaurant is fresh.
"I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a coach with a similar price first. It's not friendly, and in fact, the price often corresponds to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive coaching will be more friendly than cheap coaching. This type of 'entry-level coaching' is actually industrial waste. They have low strength, and when you hit the racket on them, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control them."
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll make something cheap and sloppy for you to play with, you'll play twice and never play again, this cheap shot is good for you, and you won't feel bad. When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you've improved, and when you come back here to buy something expensive, I'll make twice as much money. It's recommended to spend similar money on a second-hand good racket, choose Prince or Tuo Le Ping, these two brands are not very famous, so good rackets are not sold at a high price, a new one costs 500-600, a second-hand one costs 200, don't you think it's enjoyable to have a thousand-dollar racket?
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once you pass the newcomer stage, I become cold. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newcomer stage.
May I ask for your help in following up on my order? It has been delayed multiple times and I am concerned about the shipping time. Can you please assist me with this? Thank you.
Thank you.
"Just to say, in fact, I already have credit?"
May I ask if I need to reorder next? Should I ignore the previous order?

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, Jiangxi Province plans to train 10,000 rural primary school music, art, and physical education teachers within the next three years to ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas. Starting from 2016, Jiangxi Province will train one music, art, and physical education teacher for each rural primary school in the province, with a total of 10,000 teachers to be trained. The training will last for three years, and the target audience is rural primary school teachers who are 45 years old or younger and have a basic knowledge or skills in music, art, and physical education, and can also teach other subjects.
Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of vocal music aesthetics, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, build a team of multi-skilled vocal music teachers, and alleviate the problem of insufficient number of rural vocal music teachers. To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to train one person in music, art, and sports in each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, a total of 300 trainees, and comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leading ability, teaching research activity design ability, teaching ability, and network training workshop construction ability, playing the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.

I don't want the food that I made 1 hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous order that I made a mistake on, but I can't find my tire.
Hello，how long will it take for the ordered food to be delivered?
Your mobile phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and your name is #NAME#. Please give a reasonable explanation.
Sure, but your co-pilot has some issues, please handle it properly.
Can you check if they are still on the way? If so, it would be best to send them directly. If they are not, please return the deposit for the reservation.
Actually, there are many discussions about what to wear for girls with a slim body. For girls with a fat body, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the difference in length should be around the knee, so that it can cover the fat thighs. If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat thighs above the knee.
Wearing clothes that are too long can give people the impression of being short and fat. If you wear clothes that are divided into upper, middle, and lower sections, you will appear taller, as different colors are used for the top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt. This will give the impression of being taller. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard issue for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are a good way to hide your body fat. High-class black shorts are also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothing, especially a black short skirt, will make you look thinner. If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably. The more popular the color, the better.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make yourself feel fat. For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to learn how to dress properly. Do not wear tight short skirts, and do not wear tops that are too short or stuffed inside the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black long socks or mesh socks (with a fine grid pattern, please), choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match it with a shirt with a ruffled collar. This can effectively cover the shortcomings of overweight girls.
Of course, it's also important for chubby girls to wear short skirts. When chubby girls wear short skirts, they should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make their chubby figure look taller. Wearing short skirts with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look more slender, which is the hottest summer style!
If you are overweight but have skinny legs as an MM, I recommend choosing a beautifully designed midi dress. Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A-line dresses are very slimming and are suitable for overweight girls. When choosing the top, it's best to opt for something that's a bit form-fitting to create a layered effect, which will make you look even slimmer.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English:  Wear a simple white T-shirt with a short skirt. Even MMs can try it. Thin girls can also try to create a stylish look. As long as you can master the rules of dressing, thin girls will also become the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing coordination, it is also important to exercise more in daily life and try to get rid of the label of "micro obesity" as early as possible 😄

Why is there only one shrimp dumpling order, but there are six copies of the chopstick order?
I won't go. I've been waiting for an hour, and no one has contacted me. This is definitely online fraud.
Do you think this is my first time ordering takeout? After investigating, it turns out that you are exactly right! I checked the address several times before placing my order, so I made sure to order from a good place. Thank you! How many days is it?
From 7:00 AM to now 9:30 AM, the order has not been sent yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Claimed to be the loudest exhaust sound in the new mountain area! This time, our team brought you this kind of car, which is many men's dream! It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini, the successor to Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of this car is close to two million yuan, and the road tax for a year is tens of thousands of yuan. It has four wheels and is driven by a diesel engine. Why is it called the LP700? Because it has a power output of 700 horsepower. Can you imagine how fast it is? The editor doesn't even know, but the data says that it can accelerate from 0-100km/h in just 2.9 seconds. That means that by the time myvi reaches 30km/h, this car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low body of the car, the flamboyant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen through the glass all perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini. As for the explanation of the car model, it's not necessary to say too much. Just Google it and you'll find the information. I summarized some explanations that Google may not have provided. It's too eye-catching, everyone is looking at it! (Actually, it's quite refreshing).
1km of fuel costs around RM1 (car owners don't care). You need to practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the car properly). The engine noise is too loud, and you will suddenly feel dizzy after getting out of the car. (But it's still very refreshing.)
The car is too big, stopping at a regular parking spot is very narrow and I'm afraid of getting hit by the door of the car next to me when it opens! It's a bit lonely because there's no one on the road (I'm talking about myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha) Don't misunderstand, this video's drag racing has nothing to do with selling it, I'm sorry!
For friends who want to shoot a video for their beloved car, welcome to contact us! More car news that you don't know is at The Car Guide / People's Car Encyclopedia, which is worth millions of dollars in car accidents!

Yes, the order is in the accepted state, but the restaurant called and said that they cannot deliver the bones due to the driver not being able to transport them. Therefore, the restaurant needs to cut the meat and bones apart, and the bones need to be discarded. Do you understand my question?

The maximum length of a university student's leave of absence for entrepreneurship in Guangxi can reach up to 5 years - Xinhua Net, May 19, 2023 (reporter Zi Yan) Reporters recently learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that Guangxi universities will implement a flexible academic system, relaxing the leave of absence period for university students and allowing them to extend their leave of absence for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years based on the original academic system. The time spent on leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be considered as practical education time. In order to promote the enhancement of university students' entrepreneurial and innovative abilities, the Education, Human Resources and Social Affairs departments of Guangxi have jointly built an entrepreneurship platform, and have constructed more university student practical teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases outside the university, providing external guarantees for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the total area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in universities should reach 3,000 square meters or above for undergraduate schools and 2,000 square meters or above for vocational schools. The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credit courses and prioritizes the conversion of outstanding students in innovation and entrepreneurship practice. University teachers should spend at least two months on-the-job training in industries and enterprises every two years to enhance their awareness and capabilities in teaching innovation and entrepreneurship.
The Autonomous Region Education Department requires all universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the plan for training university students in innovation and entrepreneurship, and strive to ensure that every university student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their college years. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

The makeup is very sophisticated, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very enjoyable, and the professional team made me feel very satisfied. The selling team's attitude was also very good, and they introduced me to their friends. I am very happy and will recommend it to my friends. Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist who made my wedding photo unique. Thank you to everyone who worked on the wedding photo today, and I look forward to seeing the final product.
Taking wedding photos is basically a physical activity, especially for photographers who have to run and jump around. The makeup artist was very attentive and helped me design a makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer was funny and lively during the shoot, making it a great experience. Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist, I hope to see myself looking this good again in the future.
Praise the bride, her eyes are beautiful, her figure is tall and slender, she looks like a virtuous wife and a good mother. After marriage, she will be diligent and frugal in managing the family. The groom is lucky to have found such a good match, he will live a happy life with his beautiful wife.

The wedding photos were so good that they blew up the photographer and makeup artist, you guys are really super professional.
Thank you very much for Mu sister's patience and meticulous guidance. I really like the photos you took. When I saw the wedding photo, I didn't recognize myself at first. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have a wedding photo that is comparable to that of a star.
The importance of taking wedding photos cannot be overstated, as both the photographer and makeup artist have a keen eye for aesthetics. Fortunately, I was able to find someone who shared my vision. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "photogenic."
A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington D.C. on the same day.
The chairman of this group, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has doubled, but in these three top American universities, the proportion of Asians remains basically the same. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the "holistic consideration" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the admission rate for Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that they hope to submit a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action after the fact to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions. They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three schools that have been complained about have not made any responses. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices. However, the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the complaint, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education organizations that participated in the complaint.
Why is the order still being executed even though the utensils were just canceled?
Can you help me check if there is any cancellation?
"But I placed the order at 5:09 this morning."
On the other side is the reservation hotline. They say they don't know if there is a phone that can directly contact them.
In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory building located in Shaoxing, Yongjia, Zhejiang from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory building. In December of the same year, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring money through a bank. Ms. Lin signed the "Factory Building Sale and Purchase Agreement" as the payee, and it was stipulated in the agreement that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would belong to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer doubled. Both parties agreed to sign the factory building sale and purchase agreement within a week.
However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as factory building sales range and payment methods, the house purchase and sale contract was delayed again and again. Considering that the two parties could not reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu. After a long search, Mr. Liu finally found a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu feel helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lin sued Mr. Wang to the Yuyang City People's Court. The court, after hearing, considered that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and could not solely blame the defendant. Therefore, it was reasonable to infer that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply the penalty of double return of deposit. The defendant did not need to bear the breach of contract liability for returning the deposit twice. After the first-instance judgment, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict. [Legal advisor] In the course of trade, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of prudence and caution. As a buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of prudence and caution when signing a contract, such as verifying the ownership information of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information. It is also necessary to clearly specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.

Jichang Restaurant (Wufangkou Store) [Mint] Environment: Medium-sized, orderly [Bell] Service: Quick service, "Ancient Method Mala Jiaozi" is my must-try dish, the mala jiaozi is too fragrant, too soft, and delicious! If you like desserts, you must try "Dongjiang Ink Fish Slippery Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh, the tofu is very tender, and the ink...taste is amazing! The meat dishes are also very good, and the service is enthusiastic.
It's been a long time since I came to Japan. The fruit I bought is still so good to drink, and it's made of real materials. The first time I tried the charcoal-grilled bun, it was the southern soft taste that I loved! The steamed rice is cooked to the perfect level of dryness and has a generous portion size. The signature Siyi paper-wrapped chicken wings are just as delicious as ever, and the example soup is also quite good. The processing of the bok choy is also quite... delicious. The service is also very enthusiastic, and the meat dishes are also very good.
Jichang Restaurant used to be a popular presence on the internet a long time ago. It was located in a small courtyard house in Dongdan and had wooden floors. People had to wait a long time to eat the steamed rice bowls at the entrance, and the clay pots used for the rice bowls were all cracked... I haven't been to Jichang for several years, and the rise of various small shops selling Guangdong cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
Rarely does a restaurant have available seats when you arrive, and the food quality is just as good as always. The taste is praiseworthy, the meat is delicious, and the main dishes are from Jiangchang outside delivery.
Rice dish: This time's menu was slightly disappointing. Three cups of chicken: The side dishes were a bit too much, and the chicken meat was slightly lacking. The main taste was a bit off, the bottom taste was not salty enough, which made the sweet taste more prominent. Everyone can add some sweetness and various spices to the side dishes...
What is the drinking method for red label whisky? Everyone has different hobbies, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, there are also people who like to drink whisky. Red label whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in all countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.

Tongni gets a red label whisky made from about 35 types of Scottish whisky, with a rich and fragrant aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The fragrance is sweet and smoky, with a hint of vanilla. The taste is fresh and clean at the beginning, with a slight aroma of grass and a strong taste of smoked barley. This whisky can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
Red Label whiskey has entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + Coca-Cola, Sprite, or New Coke, etc. carbonated beverages have become a fashionable drink that lasts forever. These sweet drinks not only have the effect of neutralizing acidity, but also visually bring happiness to people, and when added to the drink, they have the effect of changing the taste of the mouth. Red Label whiskey + lemon slice + sugar (sand sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way of drinking.
The traditional red label whiskey has a slightly sour taste, which can be neutralized by adding sugar. Lemon can also bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweet-sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. The above three are the best way to drink red labeled whiskey, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
If you cannot change the location of the store for me, can you consider delivering instead?
So I don't need to give him any more money, right?
The order of my colleague has already been sent, but I can't seem to finish it. The GPS is not working.  (Note: I couldn't translate the last word of the sentence as it was not specified in the original text.)
The bride-to-be's wedding photoshoot (South Street store) was temporarily postponed because we didn't arrange the time properly. We had to change the time twice, and the consultant, Ms. Lan Lan, was very patient in helping us arrange the time. Later, we chose a weekend with good weather to take the photos.  (Note: I couldn't translate the last word of the sentence as it was not specified in the original text.)
The staff of Jin Fujun are all highly praised, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers. It was my first time officially having makeup done, and I was amazed - I couldn't believe that I would one day look that good. Zhang Jingjing and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) did my makeup, and it was very natural and took a lot of patience.
The outdoor scene was filmed in Kowloon City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, and I didn't feel too cold. When we were taking photos, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and accessories from time to time and helped us arrange them slightly if they looked a bit messy. The photographer was also very funny and seemed to be in a good mood all day. When we were choosing the photos, we didn't want to let the customers delete too many photos on the internet, but when we chose the photos, we didn't add any extra ones. We just chose the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin, who took my wedding photos, added more than 1,000 extra photos to a package that cost 7,000, which surprised me and made me afraid that I would choose too many).
Today, I took some photos and my sister gave them to me. I looked at them and thought two of them weren't very good, so they immediately helped me retake them. I turned over the photos my sister took before and compared them to the new ones. I was really satisfied with our photos, they were simple and fresh, just the style I wanted. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Hanfu Lady in Xi'an to take their wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan. The wife sincerely wishes that you will be happy and prosperous, with a bright future ahead of you. How much is this set?
What conditions must the $32 satisfy in order to be used?
Alright, no need to return the money.
"Your co-pilot says he can't find it, but I still don't understand what he's saying in English."

The company has overtime, and there is no more food for lunch. I want to order takeout, but I don't know if it will be canceled.
Your name is Zheng Mi, and this is your second week in Japan. You are walking on the street when suddenly someone is following you. You become scared and start running faster and faster, until you finally stop and turn around. The person behind you calls out, "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese conversation) You stop at the convenience store entrance.
Miss... I am a director. I think you look very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show? You are very hesitant and afraid that it is a scam. He gives you his business card, and you find out that he is a director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The salary will definitely not be cheap." You hesitated for a moment and agreed to come to the company with him. He said that he saw you on the street and was very happy to invite you. You thought it was a good opportunity to make some money without any loss, so you signed the contract.

So, can the system see the new order and how will it handle the rider?
I think I can't accept orders with a delay of more than 20 minutes, as none of them have been sent yet.
In Sabah, 3,200 newborn babies have yet to receive their birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the stock of anti-forgery paper was used up for other purposes, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October. The number of affected individuals has reached 3,200 to date. However, the department's director, Kharudin Amins, assured that all babies who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system, and that they will be issued once the anti-forgery paper arrives next week.
At a press conference, he addressed the issue of a 10-month-long news report on the paper-making problem in Sarawak. He explained that the problem had occurred two months earlier and that Sarawak was also facing the same issue. "One of the reasons is that a Chinese factory that specializes in producing anti-forgery paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivering to our country."
He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRU Amirullah revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has already arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work. "The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the paper, and it will be immediately processed for the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will be delivered to the applicant by December 20th."
"We will notify applicants to collect their admission documents at the respective district offices." He added that a total of 24,801 admission documents have been issued in Sabah so far this year.

Educational news: The ratio of special talents in Beijing's middle school entrance examination in 2016 was compressed on the 21st and 22nd of January, and the organization of the middle school entrance examination for special talents in Beijing was unified by the respective education committees of each district. This year, the admission ratio of special talents in Beijing's middle schools has been compressed, and the competition among special talents has become more intense.
Using Chongqing City as an example, the proportion of primary school students who are admitted to junior high school with special talents this year is generally less than 5% of the total number of students admitted to the district's enrollment plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 people. The enrollment ratio of the school does not exceed 10% of the planned enrollment of the school. Students with sports, art, and science and technology specialties who have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent enrollment examination. To facilitate students' nearby participation in the examination, Chongqing City continues the examination arrangement of last year and sets up 1-2 examination sites in each school, with a total of 13 examination sites.

The president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee recently stated that he believes China has the ability to successfully host the Winter Olympics during a special period. The Bosnian Olympic Committee is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and is confident that China will be able to host a successful event. The Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yi Ping, met with the president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Kvesic, in Sarajevo.
When they met, Kaveen expressed his positive evaluation of the China-Pakistan relationship and said that he had visited China in 2008 during the Beijing Olympics. He was deeply impressed by China's excellent organizational work and believed that China had the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during special times. The Polish side was looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Polish Olympic Committee was actively organizing the event. They hoped to use this opportunity to expand sports exchanges and cooperation with China. Yi Ping said that China and Poland have a special "Olympic belt" relationship. The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open, presenting a simple, safe, and spectacular show to the world.
The Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is expected to deepen cooperation in the preparation and training of athletes for winter sports events, and to continue playing a bridging role between the two countries. The embassy will use the opportunity of the Beijing Winter Olympics to promote cultural exchanges between the two countries and make the people of both countries "move towards the future" together. The embassy also wishes for Bosnian athletes to perform well at the Beijing Winter Olympics. Before the meeting, the Bosnian Olympic Committee held an award ceremony for the "Best Athlete of the Year," with Yi Ping serving as a special guest and presenting the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The event featured a looped broadcast of promotional videos for the Beijing Winter Olympics.

The National Defense and Epidemic Prevention Mechanism of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic in border cities. It requires that people who need to leave the land border cities (excluding those with Hong Kong and Macao) within 48 hours must have a 48-hour nucleic acid test negative certificate, and after arriving in the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test. According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of confirmation of the border city by each province, region, and city and the announcement of the border city range to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, cities along the border can study the establishment of epidemic prevention buffer zones within their jurisdiction. The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office responsible person introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar for the local area, and people from both sides travel back and forth frequently. Implementing differentiated management policies, which was originally a single line of defense, can become two lines of defense, with the hope of achieving pre-emptive control and compressing the risk of epidemic spread, thus achieving the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local outbreaks of the epidemic in China, all of which are imported from abroad through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems in the monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk positions, the formality of regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain logistics, the irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic. The notice requires efforts to be made from nine aspects, including completing the mechanisms for border city epidemic prevention and control, improving the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implementing border control measures, and strengthening the management of centralized isolation sites. We must not relax our guard, do scientific and precise work in epidemic prevention and control, and tighten the defenses at the border to prevent the import of epidemics.
The notice emphasizes that cities along the coast should synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the guarantee of basic living needs, and publish and widely disseminate the hotline for basic living needs guarantee. It should regularly inspect the supply and price of basic living necessities, and promptly solve and proactively respond to prominent issues reflected by the public. According to the notice, the cities along the coast include the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (autonomous regions, municipalities), and directly-administered cities located at the land, water, and air ports. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

The following is the translation of the text from Chinese to English:  On December 11, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" was posted on the oil pipeline platform, which caused widespread attention. The video reveals the truth about the US military's 20-year addiction to bloodshed and killing. (Source: Oil Pipeline)
The film tells the story of how the United States, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, launched a war in Afghanistan and forced the export of American democracy. After 20 years of poverty, barbarism, and bloodlust, the US military has committed countless crimes against humanity. They have used drone strikes to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas, twisting the nature of humanity and forming a murderous group. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has established a "black site" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation. Repeated acts of inhumanity have sparked more hatred among Afghans. As the video says, the US "war on terror" is becoming more and more terrifying.
Translation:  War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the Afghan people. It has only brought a country full of scars and destruction, and countless killings. Let's take a look at the video and expose the truth behind the United States' so-called "anti-terrorism," which is addicted to bloodshed and killing. Let's pierce through the hypocrisy and false facade of American democracy!
The food delivery was late, and when it arrived, it was cold. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard to eat. It was completely inedible and the soup spilled out.
Immediately cancel, the things sent by #PRS\_ORG# must have cooled down, I haven't taken them yet! #NAME# says you haven't sent anyone to pick them up.
If you don't refund the money after we call, I will report it to the police.
"多次用#PRS\_ORG#，今天这次是最差的体验完全不能接受好的，可以"  This translates to "I have used #PRS\_ORG# multiple times, and today's experience was the worst. It is completely unacceptable."
But also remind the restaurant and the driver to avoid such incidents from happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time, but the time keeps delaying and I don't know when to wait.
If you cancel the order, can you refund the money?
How do you want to pay for the rideshare service fee?
"A flight attendant confirmed a few hours ago that they would no longer be willing to wait."
Don't knock people down at the starting line - when browsing books on the internet, you can often feel the explosion of success books. Today's success books often claim to be "the best principles" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it", and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it.
Translation:  It's equivalent to saying that you've gone beyond the "how to do it" phase, which is actually the most important and fundamental step. Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either you do it to the best of your ability or you don't do it at all; either you're at 100 or you're at 0; either you climb the mountain or you wait patiently at the starting line. This "best principle" makes everyone acknowledge that it is "absolutely correct," but 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you need to make a decision, turn over a new leaf, and embark on a 180-degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people. For those who are rigid in their ways, stuck in the past, and resistant to change, you would do well to shout "you need to transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the piano. Most people would tremble at the mere mention of "transformation," hedge their bets, and find it difficult to make a decision; or else, they would make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and boldly take the first step, only to find that the scenery doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for long.
The famous "From Tomorrow" song by Mr. Ma Sanlitun is a classic that best illustrates the "universal human nature" of this "best principle". The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, causing most people to "knock on the door in awe". Perhaps a "second-best principle" is a possible way for more ordinary people to take a relative path to success.
The core of "次好原则" lies in "reducing the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "striving for small victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand hill in front of your house, because it's stronger than standing still. In short, whatever you do, it's stronger than not doing it. With the threshold greatly reduced, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and once you persevere, the chance of success will also increase.
Only by following the "second best principle" can the successful path be slightly longer. In summary, although the "best principle" flies the flag of making everyone successful on the surface, it ultimately only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second best principle" can effectively motivate more people and make it possible for more people to benefit.
"Do I need to reorder now?"
The phone keeps ringing without anyone answering, and it hasn't been sent yet.
May I ask, when will it be delivered? How can I contact you? Can you cancel the order?
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two meals, but there is an order that has been completed. I would like to ask how to contact the first taxi driver who took me before. I think there should be another taxi driver who will send me.
The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results released by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province. The current resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake is 10.85 million tons, an increase of 40% compared to the initial protection period in 2002. Qinghai Lake is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to the lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, influenced by factors such as large-scale killing, overpopulation of carp, and deterioration of the aquatic environment, the number of carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2592 tons. In 2004, Qinghai Lake carp was listed in the "Red List of Endangered Species in China". Since 2003, the Qinghai Provincial Government has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any unit, organization, or individual from catching, selling, or trading Qinghai Lake carp and its products.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release of fish and the cleaning of the main inflow and outflow rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages," measures have been continuously strengthened to protect Qinghai Lake. The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased year by year through these measures. Qinghai Province's Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau deputy director Yang Lin introduced that as of now, Qinghai Lake has implemented artificial breeding and release of fish for nearly 1.8 billion fish, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources. The Three Rivers Source Area in Qinghai is an important ecological barrier and water source area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
To protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges region and the Qinghai Lake watershed, and to protect the aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive "one river, one lake, one river" fishing ban management system.

The restaurant only gave me a bag to put my food in, and it's cold outside.
May I ask a question, is the food packed in a bag? We only see a bag and wonder if it's a missing delivery or if someone has taken it, thanks.
It has been 1 hour already, and I still haven't sent it.
Today is the Chinese Lunar New Year, and it is customary to send gifts to friends and family. However, if you accidentally send the wrong gift, it can be disappointing. It is recommended to book a separate table for children to eat at the restaurant, and to check the quality of the products before sending them out.
Is it because the bathtub is leaking electricity? Choosing an appropriate bathtub can have a good therapeutic effect on your feet. Today, the country's small editor will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, healthcare appliances such as foot baths are selling like hotcakes. However, there is no dedicated industry standard for foot baths, which poses a certain safety risk. "It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation in his soles.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that was causing the sensation in his feet, but he didn't realize that he had turned off the vibration function. Even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store and the store's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the popular bathtub that has been around for a long time, such as how to set the highest temperature, which group of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process. Therefore, it is recommended to choose a disassembled bathtub when purchasing.
Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards. At the same time, you can freely take an electric pen test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened today - Viewpoint - Hunan Daily Online - Huocheng Online Hunan Daily December 10, 2022 (Full-media reporter Zhang Shanwu, Hu Pianpian, correspondent Liu Xiaoling, photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Hengzhou Red Tea Promotion Conference were held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of becoming a billion-dollar tea industry. The vice chairman of the National Wholesale and Retail Cooperative Society, Hu Shunli, and the vice chairman of the Hunan Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hong, specially attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced solemnly at the opening ceremony: The source of Lushan tea is in Nanchang, and the rising of Longjing tea injects new vitality into "Five-Colored Xiang Tea". In recent years, the provincial committee and government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of a trillion-yuan Xiang tea industry, and formed a development pattern of "Three Xiangs, Four Waters, and Five Colors of Tea". The tea industry within the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main forces of the tea industry, and the main tea-producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving tea farmers to increase their income.
The wind and water cycle turns, and the red tea gains strength. Provincial tea experts say that after completing the green tea and red tea harvest, the tea farmers have income all year round, and the tea garden's output value continues to rise linearly. At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Lake South Red Tea" trademark, and New Hope held the "Lake Red Source".
At the Xinhua Red Tea Museum in Fujian, local tea merchants fell in love with a high-mountain tea called "Ice in the Spring". They immediately placed an order. The secretary-general of the Fujian Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, was pleased to say that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea leaf market, but from the scene of the tea exhibition, the highlights were eye-catching. The Xinhua Red Tea was dyed red and infused with the cultural connotations of tea, and the popularity was great and the trading was hot. The Chaozhou tea industry warmly welcomed the arrival of the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled? I don't want them anymore because I can't stop here, and he couldn't send them over.
#AMOUNT# yuan has been received, it is the missing food.

I am currently facing #PRS\_ORG# across from me.
Hello, may I ask, how long will it take for the order to be delivered if the delivery time keeps extending?

I demand that you cancel immediately, otherwise I will report to the police.
Time-lapse photography is currently unavailable. Members can provide feedback on the [effect] of the photo effect: taking two sets of clothing, overall it's not bad. I particularly like this set of photos.
[Service] Service details: Because pregnant women may feel uncomfortable during makeup, the makeup artist and staff are very considerate. They let me rest for a while and continue to offer me a hot towel service at a price of 1000 yuan. Thank you, rabbit, for your review. Originally, I was going to refuse the ancient style, but the final product was so beautiful that I didn't expect it.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us continue to be full of energy and move forward. We will continue to do our best! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come here! Whether it's reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, or post-production, there is no room for improvement.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate, and will tailor your makeup to suit your style. The makeup products used are all from top brands. As for the photographer, he is equally professional. The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are even two cute little kittens playing around.
We are working in Beijing, and all the good theaters in Beijing need to be booked half a year in advance. My colleagues have been to Beijing and said that the movie was just so-so. I specially searched for this workplace, a place with soul and attitude. Our facial expression control is not very good, and we think this is a common problem for most people. The photographer Xiaohao will take pictures and record the natural beauty of the moment.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, an exquisite team. Whenever we show our work to others, including our friends and family, they all praise it highly. I have already recommended my friends to you before, and after they saw the final product, they were just as delighted as I was.
I hope this kind of workspace won't be buried, and more people will discover TA, and take out their own style, rather than being uniform. I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Xiang Ying and Xing Liang for their five-star reviews. Both of them are very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are a creative workshop, and we will do our best with 100% effort and 200% enthusiasm to meet the customer's requirements. I also want to thank the sweet and gentle assistant who helped us, as well as the lively and open-minded photographer who taught us. Everyone in our team is super nice, and it was a beautiful and unforgettable shooting experience. The effect of the shooting was even better than I imagined, and I appreciate everyone's hard work. Thank you all! 😘😘
Thank you for the review, Xiao Yu. Meeting you is also a matter of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is like a journey of several thousand kilometers. I am very happy to have met you and hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao again to play.
I want to know how to give money? The meal that was sent again has already been delivered.
"No waiter is currently available to take my order at the restaurant."
A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and it takes six months to learn. But if you plan to enter this industry, training is a good choice, especially for those who lack self-study ability, training is even better.
If you have relatively strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is an important thing. Firstly, you need to look at the teacher force of this institution. If the teacher force is not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions have not yet built up their teacher force.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, investigate the institution itself and its students, because only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not. Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't introduced your situation to me. Learning this and your personal situation are closely related. For example, your profession, age, desired language to learn, and even where you are located can all affect your learning or desired industry.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science major who has already graduated, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way, and now there are many offline and online training institutions that are not bad, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is relatively large, basically requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months. However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient, as there are many free learning resources on the network, or you can find many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time cost, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teacher's explanations are also very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone specially assigned to answer them. In addition, many training institutions now have employment agreements, and they can recommend you to companies after you finish your studies. This way, when you go for an interview for a job, you can save a lot of trouble. These are my some thoughts. Since I don't know your situation, I can only roughly introduce them. If you have any other questions, you can contact me at any time for consultation and communication.
I said 1 point earlier, I saw it in the App as well.
What do you call it when I haven't finished speaking, and what are you doing?
Thank you to those who have silently given me a thumbs up. I am willing to undertake various tasks such as installation, cleaning, maintenance of boilers, water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, urinals, stoves, oil burners, lighting fixtures, and window cleaning. I specialize in professional sewing and offer home cleaning services. Life can be tough, but we must continue to live without regret for every effort we put in. If you enjoy my work, please give me a thumbs up. Thank you again to those who have silently given me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only look at the result, while I alone struggle through the process, facing life, we are not only strong, but also persistent, with no other choice, the road can be turned back to look at, but cannot be turned back to go. Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility, life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes splendid through sincerity. Although we do the dirtiest work, we will use the most serious attitude to thoroughly clean every corner of the customer's house, and when we see the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised thumb, we know that all the hard work is worth it and the effort is rewarded!
My daily work - your requirements, my service. Serving with heart, cleaning with heart, leaving behind beauty.
Translation:  Concerns you care about, the Boon Guat household helps you achieve "cleanliness" to the best of my abilities, serving the family with love. Keeping all households clean and tidy, building a household cleaning hall of fame, providing top-notch service, and maintaining cleanliness throughout the home. Internal and external cleaning, my daily work.
The crystal lamp may be beautiful, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and lack luster. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. Similarly, in life, we must take care and effort to make things successful and refined. We must pay attention to the details and be meticulous in our craftsmanship. Our stitches are our reputation. Give us a chance, and we will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worthy of trust. Your recognition is our greatest encouragement!
The current situation in various industries is not good at all! However, I always believe that as long as we have a serious attitude, persevere, and work hard, we will be better than others, and at least we won't be complaining all day long. One day's plan starts from the morning, all the beautiful things begin from the morning. I hope you can start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything goes well. Keep a good mood all day long and have a good morning!
When I was young, happiness was a thing to be possessed, and having it made me happy; as I grew older, happiness became a goal to be achieved, and achieving it made me happy; but as I matured, I discovered that happiness was originally a state of mind, and understanding it made me happy. By being the best version of myself and acting in accordance with my heart, I can live a life without regrets; life is but one path, and it is up to us to choose our own way; life has two precious treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, and we should strive to make the most of them and shine brightly until old age. Each stage of life brings its own set of challenges.
Often, what constricts you is not your ability, but your active courage. Since you can't avoid it, it's better to face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face them bravely, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The curator of the first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia collaborated with the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing to organize the exhibition, which was officially opened to the public on December 11 in the Diriyah JAX Arts Center located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other regions participated in the exhibition. The first contemporary art biennial in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Biennial, was jointly planned by the Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. The director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, Tian Yi, served as the art director of the exhibition.
According to the introduction by the curatorial team, the theme of this year's exhibition is "Touching the Stones to Cross the River," which represents the reform strategies taken during the period of social and economic transformation in Saudi Arabia, and also reflects the current situation of cultural development in Saudi society. The exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and is housed in six interconnected buildings, with six units presented: "Touching the Stones to Cross the River," "Tradition as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Going Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among the 27 Saudi Arabian artists' works, more than 50% of the total number of exhibits are included, covering painting, installation art, and performance art in various forms; 12 Chinese artists' works are also well-received, some of whom use recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing's "The Story Behind the Mountains Never Ends" series (2014), which reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded objects.
The director of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakkali, expressed the hope that this year's biennale would establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the cultural and creative industries of Saudi Arabia and its vibrant creative community, and strengthen interaction and exchange. Tianwei Yu said: "The goal of the biennale is double, allowing Saudi Arabia's contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and also allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art." According to reports, a series of lectures will also be held during the opening period of the biennale, with artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry discussing topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Bones can be used, call the restaurant to have them packed and delivered separately.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net Yunnan Province Kunming December 12th (reporter Lin Bixiong) In order to continue to do a good job in poverty alleviation and promote the all-round development of rural areas, Yunnan Province has recently taken measures to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty reduction, and assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security responsible person introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 44.83 million public welfare positions in rural areas, which are used to provide employment for poverty-stricken labor forces and other difficult groups in rural areas, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment growth, consolidating poverty reduction achievements, and effectively improving the capacity of various public services in rural areas.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Department of Ethnic and Religious Affairs, the Rural Revitalization Office, the Ministry of Finance, and six other departments. It mainly regulates the scope of recruitment, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions for public welfare positions at the grassroots level. In terms of position development, the new regulation is clear that positions should be set up according to the principle of "post-based recruitment, personnel-based management, dynamic management, and quota control" and the principles of "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management." The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of advertisement, application, review, announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.
Can you please cancel the order? The address is incorrect.

Although the right-wing has had some glorious times in history, it has not lasted long. The reason why it is short-lived is that it shines brightly when it gets a little bit of sunlight and sweats when it drinks a little bit of water. As soon as it gets a little bit of power, it becomes arrogant and looks down on Sichuan. However, in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in promoting social progress. From the end of the Cultural Revolution to defining the truth, promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting political institutionalization and human rights protection, the right-wing's positive significance should not be denied.
Three, as for me, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems. However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that it is unnecessary to overthrow the government, and that revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, damage people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. Finally, it is the foreigners who take advantage of the situation.  Four, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunists who try to profit from the situation are not right-wingers, but rather troublemakers.
Let's talk more about the left. The left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of history and politics. If the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has no positive significance because the left is what the Communist Party has discarded!
Translation:  V. Recently, I've seen some friends complaining about the other side's thieves and leftists, even getting angry and acting tough. I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with the Han collaborators and leftists, it's all nonsense. Also, don't try to prove that we're right, and don't try to make the thieves and leftists admit it, why bother?
I tell my friends: When the villain insults you for five cents, and when the left-handed person insults you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but after they became old, they forgot their ideals, or pursued them and ended up as fanatics. As we move further and further away from our ideals, we may even become dragon-slaying youths who ultimately turn into evil dragons.
I generally feel that "left" and "right" refer to constraints and freedom, and China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic inheritance. While domestic right-wingers prioritize freedom and efficiency, left-wingers emphasize regulation and fairness. Nowadays, society as a whole desires greater emphasis on fairness, and with the US-China competition, a left-leaning approach is generally favored, and this trend is likely to continue for many years to come.

I can't wait until 19:06 to place an order. It's been two hours already! 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "weird searches" [奇怪的热搜]. What is the normal public opinion? Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Dragon Raises Its Head, Hua Li Friend Raises Prices, and the Pinduoduo Incident, public opinion spreads and forms a peak, then [指数下降] (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the network sentiment evolution model displayed on the official website of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. What is abnormal sentiment? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a peak, a sawtooth, and a cliff.
【Isolated Peak】This refers to the situation where individuals act as a catalyst for heating and quickly climb the hot search rankings, attracting the attention of the public.  【Sawtooth Pattern】This refers to the situation where there is periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings.  【Cliff Edge】This refers to the situation where there is a collective withdrawal, and the hot search performs its "function" by receiving a new task and moving towards a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave exactly matches the trough of another event's heat wave, occurring at the same time and with no time difference, indicating that the unified water army has received a new task and launched a new offensive. The professionalism of black public relations can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke war, which ones shift the focus, which ones influence cognition, which ones lead to misjudgments, which ones arouse emotions, which ones manipulate decisions, and which ones
Translation:  Spreading is a science, discarding subjective factors such as opinions and emotions, and only relying on objective data. Even black public relations will have nowhere to hide. All traces must be left behind when passing through, and these traces, let's dig them out together. Data source: Time Capsule.
Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. Mauritius reported two cases of the Omicron variant on December 10th.
According to the introduction by the Chinese Minister of Health, Qi Le, a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th was infected with the COVID-19 virus; another infected person was a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius. The latter tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th. Both patients were isolated and treated at the hospital, and their COVID-19 test results turned negative after treatment. They have now returned to their respective homes. The Cyprus Health Department announced on November 10th that three cases of COVID-19 infection with the Omicron variant had been confirmed in the country for the first time.
These three people are all students. They returned to the country from abroad this month and have not been hospitalized for treatment. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has continuously increased its epidemic prevention efforts. Starting from December 6th to January 10th, all passengers aged 12 or above who enter the country by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 years old in the country with Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine. Malawi's Health Minister, Khumbize Chipanda, said on the 9th that the country has discovered its first three cases of Omicron variant infection. The health department of Malawi conducted gene sequencing on 12 new coronavirus positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these three cases of infection.

The following text is in Chinese:  收到是金钱肚订单是凤爪好的，电话是 #PHONENUMBER#  And the English translation is:  I have received the order for money delivery, and the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained everything to them.
Your co-pilot told me the address is too far.
The text is about a person's experience with a 360-degree home renovation service in China. The address of the service is provided as "Ring City South Road 156, Happy Family Garden 12th Floor." The person initially chose the service because of a recommendation from a friend, and their initial budget for the renovation was 70,000 yuan.
When I arrived at the store, a series of tricks began. I was just there to show them my house model, but they didn't even go to measure the house. They were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 7 million, and they basically showed me their materials without knowing what brand they were. Their second trick was that once you hand over the deposit at the store, you'll never be able to get it back (unless you have enough experience and know how to handle disputes with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. I was impulsive and paid over 10,000 yuan in deposit. The quote they gave me had many problems. The price did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom, which are the costs of basic installation.
The service fees of these companies are higher than those of other companies. I lost trust in this company because they didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and made me sign a contract. When I tried to get my money back, they acted like they were experienced and had a special team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it is, it will bite the customer's problem, and they are completely innocent. Various shifts of responsibility, as well as many details, if you don't say them all, it will be tears. In summary, don't choose them because my friend found their renovated house to be of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage. The scam, they were originally the head of decoration that deceived people, but now they have become beautiful again, as if they have collapsed and changed into other things.
Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing such a shoddy construction company. In the future, when you choose, you should carefully check and consult because construction is not a small matter. If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibited from publishing various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant's recording statement for detailed information. The Qunxing Decoration and Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours. Find a decoration company and submit your review on the Qunxing Decoration and Design Channel.
This is so terrifying, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel if it takes more than 15 minutes.
The chicken should be cooked, but the one I received is raw, and I can't eat it.
Already 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan! The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card for payment, but now I have to pay for shipping every time.
Can you exempt me from paying the monthly fee first, and then collect it from me after you have finished your investigation? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery agent?
It's already 3 o'clock, isn't it time for you to give me compensation and say you'll deliver the goods?
But the taxi driver put it at the door, and then the people left and sent it wrong.
Your delivery person has already picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting for the delivery person who arrived at 19:25 to pick up my order. However, they are still not willing to take me to buy the rest of the food. Should I order another delivery?
How do you handle it when your co-pilot goes somewhere and you still have to wait?
"I am going to send a complaint. If you do not cancel, I will report it to the police."
"But my food may have safety and hygiene issues."

"It's okay, just reply with the promotional code. Don't forget that you don't need to arrange for a re-send. I have already purchased it separately and don't want to waste it. Thank you for your help."
From the past to the present, I have always been opposed to any form of vulgarity and insults, and I cannot accept such behavior towards individuals. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of bad behavior. If we do not consider political parties and factions, the first thing we should resist is this uncivilized attitude.
From the moment you started sending me friend requests on WeChat and posting joking posts, followed by your attempt to publish my hometown and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude. After that, you continued to tag me at a frequency of one post per day, and even discussed with your so-called friends on WeChat about some embarrassing and unclear things about me, such as my appearance, figure, upbringing, what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed, and whether or not I like to insert things, I... I've had enough. Later, I received messages from several friends that you had uploaded a photo of you on WeChat and made sexually suggestive comments.
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my report was uploaded, you did not calm down at all, but rather became more and more arrogant. I don't care about your political background or your identity and status, in our society, it is necessary to respect both men and women.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of ironic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment. In fact, you can even go so far as to deny that it's not a picture you made or continue to publish any attacking statements. That's right, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't even know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and body shape don't need your evaluation or commentary.
I don't even believe that there is a girl who would be willing to humiliate herself like this in exchange for fame. A friend asked me if I was okay, and I said yes, but you won't believe it either.
I think no woman would be able to say that she is still okay after being treated so cruelly. Whether it's in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those people who have no basic morality would choose to hurt any woman in such a way. I believe that justice will prevail in the end.
I have cut off part of the comments for everyone to evaluate your own posts. No one can impersonate you, right? I can only say that you are a civilized enemy.
The Chinese phrase "会心一笑" can be translated to English as "a smile that warms the heart."
I have reported it and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What's the use of a cow if it doesn't have any meat? It's just a water chicken. And what's the point of eating raw meat? It's impossible.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food and not leftovers?

Why do we need to remake something so inappropriate?
The "智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Changsha, Hunan. Provincial Party Committee member and Organization Department Minister Wang Chang attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that holding a talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central Talent Work Conference and the 12th Provincial Party Congress, and reflects Hunan's emphasis on talent, pursuit of talent, and utilization of talent. Hunan has an excellent tradition of valuing talented people, providing a broad platform for talent development, and creating favorable conditions for a beautiful life. In recent years, it has deeply implemented the strategy of talent-led development, with the Fenghuang Talent Action Plan serving as the driving force, and has built a comprehensive talent work framework from talent attraction to retention and utilization, becoming a fertile land for talent growth, a hotbed for innovation and entrepreneurship, and a comfortable and prosperous place to live and work. Currently, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "Three High Four New" strategic positioning and mission, and will further open the door to attract talents and create more favorable policies, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, looking forward to the wisdom and strength of outstanding talents from all sectors to jointly contribute to
Activities were set up at the scene, including the Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangzhou Exhibition Center, and the Hunan Free Trade Pilot Zone Exhibition Center.

It turns out that there are a total of 11 floors in the building, from the second basement to the ninth basement.

Recently, I've been looking for a comfortable sofa to buy, and my friends told me that this store has a lot of sofas to choose from. I checked out the websites of Decoration House and Meike Home and felt that they were okay, but the prices were slightly higher. I'm still undecided, so I turned to Douyin for help.
