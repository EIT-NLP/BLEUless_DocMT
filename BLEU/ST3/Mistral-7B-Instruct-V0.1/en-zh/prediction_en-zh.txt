While all of those caught in the avalanche were experienced backcountry skiers, a warning had been issued against skiing in the area, which was just inside the boundaries of Crystal Mountain Resort. The private ski resort determines the conditions but there is nothing that stops skiers from going there because the property abuts public lands in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Frank DeBerry, the resort's president and CEO, said all six men held the ski resort's uphill travel passes, which means they were registered with ski patrol, participated in an orientation on how and where to access backcountry skiing through the resort's property and were required to check snow conditions prior to their excursion.

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games. Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.

 [/INST]  gabba的双重电气故障原因解释，以及它可能再发生的风险。 gabba的播出中心设施的电气故障风险 inherent 不太可能在下一次杯赛之前改善，因为 cricket authorities 正在等待更多的详细信息关于 stadium 的主要升级计划，以 Host 2032 奥lympic Games。来源告诉 The Age 和 The Sydney Morning Herald， gabba 是澳大利亚 cricket 中唯一的主要stadium，ground 上的主要电气供应不足以启动广播车辆和设备，用于将世界各地播出图片。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four. That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

 [/INST] 在第四天，全球广播的 Gabba Test 的主要和备用生成器出现了约 25 分钟的故障。这是因为 Gabba 的精inct 中的基本电力需要供应 Gabba 的光塔和地面自 2019 年 Big Bash League 比赛中不orious 的一台光塔，以及地面本身。因此，广播人员从一台大规模的 diesel 燃油生成器，用于 Test 比赛，获得了主要的电力供应，备用电力 supposedly 来自备用生成器。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators. All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.

 [/INST] 但是，Test比赛第四天，主要生成器熔接了备用生成器，导致两个同时失败，导致广播图像和DRS的总或部分失败，近30分钟。NEP，提供Fox和Seven外部广播车和其他设施的公司，已经向提供生成器的公司寻求解释。所有用于Ashes比赛的其他地点，包括Adelaide Oval、MCG、SCG和Bellerive Oval在澳大利亚岸 Hobart的地点，都将提供主要供应电力给广播者，留下一台燃油生成器作为备用。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match. Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

 [/INST] 这个差异，在过去几个月对宿主广播公司Fox Cricket造成了很大的挑战，在Ashes Test中被加大了，因为有限的生产和技术团队能够监控比赛中的各种虚拟球。Cricket Australia被Fox警告了几个月，如果比赛在澳大利亚保持在澳大利亚，则从技术上更安全。但如果比赛在澳大利亚保持在澳大利亚，则有“巨大的风险”，允许进入澳大利亚的薄弱团队。

POSTECH announced on the 10th that a research team led by Professor Lee Jung-wook of the Department of Chemical Engineering has developed molecular diagnostic technology that can detect the Omicron variant in just 20-30 minutes and will publish the results online. Omicron is a variant in which 26-32 mutations in the spike, which is used to infect cells by the COVID-19 virus. According to the research team, molecular diagnostics technology can distinguish mutations at the single-nucleotide base, so it can detect "Stealth Omicron," which are difficult to be detected by PCR tests.

 [/INST] 中国科技大学（POSTECH）于2021年10月10日宣布， Professor Lee Jung-wook 的Department of Chemical Engineering领导的研究团队已经开发出可以在20-30分钟内检测Omicron变种的分子诊断技术，并将结果在线发布。Omicron是一种涉及26-32个在病毒COVID-19中用于感染细胞的胎膜的变异，据研究团队说，分子诊断技术可以检测单个核苷醇基因变异，因此可以检测“潜在Omicron”，这些变异对PCR测试难以检测。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot. The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology.

 [/INST] 目前，韩国中心疾病控制中心正在使用三种方法检测COVID-19变种：全基因分析、目标DNA（如肺脏胺胺蛋白）分析和PCR检测。 Delta变种可以通过当前的PCR检测，但Omicron不能。本次发展的技术不是一种读取DNA或RNA序列的序列方法，而是分子诊断技术。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection. According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.

 [/INST] 当前技术只能检测病毒的特定区域，但分子诊断技术旨在在 COVID-19 RNA 存在的情况下导致核苷酸结合反应，使快速检测成为可能。根据教授李的说明，Omicron 有强大的 N 基因信号在 PCR 检测中，但 S 基因信号较弱。如果 "Stealth Omicron" 的 N 和 S 基因都确认阳性，这使其与其他变种难以区别。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour). In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily.

As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.

We will try to quickly diagnose and respond to new variants that may come out after COVID-19.

'Interview with the Vampire' author Anne Rice dies at age 80 She passed away due to complications resulting from a stroke, Christopher Rice said. Rice's biggest success was her first novel, "Interview with the Vampire," which was published in 1976 and introduced the character of the vampire Lestat, who would be the central character in the 13-book Chronicles series, the most recent of which was published in 2018.
