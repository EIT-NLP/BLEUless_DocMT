重庆中职学校试点现代学徒制 入学即是企业准员工-新华网昨天，记者从市教委获悉，今年起，我市将在60所中职学校试点“现代学徒制”人才培养模式，接受试点培养的学生同时具备学徒身份，招生录入后将被试点企业预录为单位员工。市教委要求，规范中职学校招生录取和企业用工程序，明确学徒的中职学校学生和企业准员工双重身份，按照双向选择原则，学徒、学校和企业签订三方协议，对于年满16周岁未达到18周岁的学徒，须由学徒、监护人、学校和企业四方签订协议，确定各方权益及学徒在岗培养的具体岗位、教学内容、权益保障等。

 [/INST] Yesterday, it was reported on the Xinhua News Agency that starting from this year, the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission has decided to pilot the "modern apprenticeship model" for talent cultivation in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for trial training will simultaneously possess apprentice status, and after being recruited, they will be pre-registered as employees of trial-point enterprises. The Chongqing Municipal Education Commission requires that the recruitment and employment processes of vocational schools and enterprises be standardized, and the dual identity of apprentices as vocational school students and enterprise employees be clearly defined. According to the dual-choice principle, apprentices, schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and for students who are not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement should be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise, to determine each party's rights and responsibilities, as well as the specific job positions, teaching content, and rights protection for apprentices in the workplace.

 [/INST] Encourage trial schools to adopt modern student forms and cooperate with enterprises to conduct pre-employment and post-employment training for enterprise employees.

 [/INST] The text can be translated to English as follows:

The trial point is used to cultivate the school system. According to the talent cultivation plan, the internship time of students in enterprises is determined based on their major. The top-level internship usually lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, it is necessary to implement the enterprise group management mode according to the characteristics of different majors. According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 market-level vocational and technical education trial points, with each trial point having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (students) were trained.

南非医生：奥密克戎传播力虽强 但多为轻症南非许多医生和医疗专家认为，新冠病毒奥密克戎变种所致病症比德尔塔变种更为轻微，虽然传播速度更快。据美联社报道，随着奥密克戎变种在南非的传播，南非豪登省的一个五千多名医生组成医师组织报告说，他们目前治疗的新冠病人出现的症状都比较轻微，例如身体疼痛和咳嗽等与流感类似的症状。

 [/INST] South African Doctors: Omicron Transmission Strong but Mild 

Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the illness caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster. According to a report by the World Health Organization, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the patients they are currently treating with COVID-19 are generally milder, such as body aches and coughs, similar to those of the flu.

 [/INST] Although it takes several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observation and early evidence provided some clues. According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, in the recent hospitalized patients with COVID-19, only 30% were severe cases, which was half of the serious illness rate in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the death rate among recent COVID-19 patients was only 3%, while in the early outbreak in South Africa, the death rate was 20%.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。

 [/INST] I want to try playing volleyball, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a cheap one to practice first. It's not friendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the friendliness, if you can't distinguish, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones, these types of "entry-level balls" are actually industrial trash. They have very low strength, the ball hits the net, the vibration is very large, the hard ball can't withstand it, high-hand players are very difficult to control.

它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

 [/INST] The logic and hidden meaning behind this is that tennis is very difficult, you know you won't be able to learn it, and you also know you won't be willing to buy expensive ones, so we'll give you some cheap ones to fool you, you'll play two games and then you won't want to play again, this way the set is cheap and you won't worry about it. Once you're able to differentiate between good and bad, that means you've made progress, at that point you can come back here and buy expensive ones, I'll make two profits. My suggestion is to spend a similar amount of money and buy a second-hand good tennis racket, choose Prince or Wilson, these two brands are not very famous, so good tennis rackets are hard to sell at a high price, a new one for 500-600 yuan is good, a second-hand one for 200 yuan, isn't it enjoyable to own a tennis racket worth a thousand yuan?

 [/INST] Wearing long clothes can make people feel short and fat. If you divide the clothes into three parts, upper, middle, and lower, it will make you look taller, using different colors for the upper part, skirt, and long socks, it will produce a feeling of elongation.

以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

 [/INST] To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, let them feel the sensation of being fat. For a slightly chubby girl, it is important to know the key to dressing fashionably. A chubby girl should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the top should not be too short or too tight, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, it is recommended to wear black long leggings or net leggings (the kind with holes), and choose soft-textured printed pants to match, which can effectively hide the shortcomings of a chubby girl.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”

 [/INST] In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory located in Xiangjiang Baluyu Xiangquan Town from his house. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Li negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the owner of the house and Lin's family. On the same day, through bank transfer, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 20,000 yuan to Lin. Lin signed the receipt of the deposit as the payee, stating that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase contract within one week.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

 [/INST] However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on the main terms of the contract, such as the scope of the factory, the payment method, etc., the house purchase contract was not signed on time. Considering that both parties could not reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Lin someone returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Luo first. After seeing the house, the deposit was paid, and the money was ready to be paid, but it was just missing "signing at the door" to sign the contract, and the seller did not sell it, which made Luo first feel helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。一审判决后，原告提起上诉。

 [/INST] For this reason, Mr. Zhuang sued Mr. Lǐn to the Baluyao People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it was not reasonable to hold the defendant solely responsible, so this case should not be applied to the penalty for breach of contract, and the defendant should not bear the responsibility of returning double the penalty for breach of contract. After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.

 [/INST] Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment. [Legal reminder] During the trading process, it is necessary to exercise caution. As a buyer, it is necessary to exercise caution when signing a contract, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by people, and other related information, and clearly stipulating the specific time and place of delivery in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.

此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

 [/INST] In addition, the notice also proposes that conditionally controlled border city quarantine zones can be set up in the jurisdiction. The relevant responsible person from the National Health and Welfare Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies, the outer control prevention line becomes two lines, which has the hope of moving the control point forward, compressing the risk of disease outbreak, and achieving the maximum effect of disease prevention with the least social impact and the least social cost.

 [/INST] Recently, many local cluster outbreaks of diseases have occurred in China, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice states that this exposes some issues with the monitoring of local epidemic situations, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, the regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain products at each stage, the unregulated management of isolation facilities, and the inadequate scientific precision of epidemic emergency handling. The notice requires that efforts be made to improve the disease prevention and control mechanisms in border cities, strengthen the monitoring and warning systems for epidemic situations, implement border control measures, and ensure that scientific and precise prevention work is done, while tightly weaving and strengthening the external defense line against input.

Regularly check the sprouting hidden dangers in the supply of basic life materials and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public. According to the notification, the indicated border cities include the counties (cities, districts, flags) where open land, water, and airports are located, as well as the cities (districts, counties, prefectures) and directly administered cities where they are located. The specific scope should be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered city) based on the requirements for epidemic prevention control and promptly announced.

 [/INST] "The core principle of '次好原则' is to 'lower the threshold' - it encourages a theory of 'small victories lead to big victories', meaning that if you can't do 100, doing 1 is enough: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your family's front door step is enough: because that's still better than staying put.

By lowering the threshold, more possibilities arise for ordinary people to persevere, and the probability of success will increase as long as you persevere."

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。

 [/INST] The reserve of sturgeon in Lake Qinghai has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching a total of 10.85 million tons, which is 40 times more than in the initial protection period in 2002. The sturgeon, also known as "tangyu," is a valuable fish species in the Qinghai Lake ecosystem, playing a crucial role in maintaining the safety of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and the biodiversity of the region.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

 [/INST] In the 1960s and 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale killing, overfishing, and environmental degradation of the breeding grounds for naked carp in the Qinghai Lake, the population of naked carp in Qinghai Lake decreased sharply. In 2002, the resource reserves of naked carp in Qinghai Lake were only 2592 tons. In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented measures to seal the lake and breed fish, prohibiting any unit, organization, or individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked carp and its products.

足浴盆泡脚发麻是漏电了吗？选择合适的的足浴盆可以起到很好的足疗保健作用，今天国美小编将针对这个问题做出解答，希望对朋友们有所帮助。随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。

 [/INST] Is the tingling sensation when soaking feet in a hot tub due to an electrical leak? Choosing the right hot tub can have great therapeutic benefits, and today's National Beauty editor will provide an answer to this question, hoping to be of help to friends. With the increasing awareness of health, hot tubs are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different price ranges are available on the market, from a few hundred to thousands of dollars, giving consumers a lot of choice.

在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。“在带电的水里泡脚，实在太危险了吧!”李先生告诉记者，近日，他买了一个足浴盆送给父亲做生日礼物，可是父亲泡脚时却感觉脚底发麻。

 [/INST] In relevant data tables, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-type household appliances such as foot spas have exploded, but there are no specific industry standards for foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. "Electric foot baths are too dangerous, aren't they?" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, Mr. Li bought a foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt his feet going numb while soaking them.

李先生一开始以为是足浴盆的振动功能引起的，没想到关了振动功能，父亲还是感觉到脚底麻麻的。李先生用电笔一试，电笔居然亮了，李先生惊讶地发现足浴盆的水里居然带电。后来他联络了商家，商家的态度还不错，尽管退掉了足浴盆，李先生依然感到不快。

 [/INST] Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet numb. Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that there was actually an electric current in the foot bath water. Later, he contacted the seller, and the seller's attitude was not bad, although they had to return the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.

因为他发现这个已经流行已久的足浴盆如今在最高温度的设定、适用于何种人群、何种材料保证无害等方面都没有一个明确详细的行业规定。但是一般情况下足浴盆是不会有带电问题的，但也不排除少数产品在出厂时没有严格把关。因此在在购买的时候选择分体式的足浴盆。

 [/INST] Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular hot tub regarding the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that are harmless, he realized that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular hot tub regarding the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that are harmless. However, in general, hot tubs are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have manufacturing defects. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular hot tub.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。

 [/INST] If one has a strong self-discipline, they can choose to self-study, but it will be tiring. Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

 [/INST] If you are a student who has not graduated yet, or you are a computer science graduate who has already graduated, and you have enough time, my personal suggestion is to self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way to learn, and now there are many good online and offline training institutions. However, the cost of learning is high, and the investment of time is quite a lot, which usually requires a concentrated training period of 3-6 months. But if you are in my situation, self-study is very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to bilibili to find training resources. If you cannot find resources, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources, or you can get detailed consultation. Moreover, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.

 [/INST] If you are not a computer major but are willing to pay a certain amount of tuition and time, I recommend going to a training institution to learn. This way, studying is not very expensive, the teacher's explanation is detailed, there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help with planning and supervision. Moreover, many training institutions now sign job placement agreements, have internal recommendations, and recommend students to companies after graduation, which can greatly simplify the job search process. In my opinion, this is a good way to learn, but since I don't know your specific situation, I can only give a general introduction. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me for consultation and communication.

Of these, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists make up more than 40% of the total exhibition pieces, including paintings, installation art, and performance art, among others; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in "The Backstory Series: Endless Mountains" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。

 [/INST] Yunnan: Standardizing the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas-Xinhua News Agency Yunnan 12 December 2021 (Reporter Lin Bijian) To continuously improve employment opportunities and alleviate poverty, and to consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty reduction, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, to support the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization. The relevant responsible person from the Yunnan Provincial People's Social Welfare Department introduced that as of now, Yunnan has developed a total of 44.83 million public welfare positions, which are used to provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups in rural areas, such as poverty-stricken labor force, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment increase, consolidate poverty reduction achievements, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of various items in rural areas.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

 [/INST] The new rules have been jointly issued by the Yunnan People's Social Welfare, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments. The main objective of the rules is to standardize the recruitment of public welfare personnel at the grassroots level, financial management, post development, and post management. In the post development setting, the new rules clearly state that, according to the principles of "on-demand recruitment, based on job definition, dynamic management, total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person, one post, self-voluntary public disclosure, and unified management," the posts will be set. The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and arrangement of on-the-job training.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

 [/INST] In addition, the new rules have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments in charge of developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and required each department in charge of developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It is also required that related departments regularly monitor the situation of subsidy payments for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

 [/INST] Two, although the right-wing has had its moment in history, it is short-lived, so short because it basks in the sunshine and sweats from drinking water; as soon as it has ambition, it becomes mired in corruption, and when it is hit, it turns into mud. However, in terms of practicality, the right-wing has played a positive role in the process of social progress. From defining the truth standard after the end of the Cultural Revolution, to promoting economic development, improving technology, and promoting the rule of law and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

 [/INST] Three, in my opinion, although I do not completely agree with Li Weidong's some statements, I am very interested in his statements, and I highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously. But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's lives will be harmed, political groups will become fish and turtles mixed in mud and sand, and finally, foreign countries will take advantage of the chaos. Four, changing or improving China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people. Political speculation is not right-wing, but mixed eggs.

 [/INST] Let's talk again about the left. The left, in fact, are the orphans of their time and politics. If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed, but the left will not be able to do this, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away.

五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

 [/INST] Five, I recently saw some friends arguing with both counterrevolutionaries and leftists, and they were very passionate and full of vigor. I think it's unnecessary. Don't try to reason with Hanjian or leftists, they're just a bunch of stubborn people.

 [/INST] I would tell my friends: when a counterrevolutionary curses you as a five-mao, when a leftist curses you as a right dog, that proves our middle path is correct! Many people had ideals in their youth, but forgot them as they grew older, or pursued them but became dogmatic. As we grew further away from our ideals, we even became monsters.

左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

 [/INST] In my opinion, left and right generally indicate constraints and freedom. China, due to its historical and cultural roots, should be generally left-leaning as a whole. Meanwhile, the right-wing in South Korea values freedom, emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens supervision, pays more attention to fairness and safety. Currently, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, but at the same time, there is a conflict between China and the United States, and it is definitely left-leaning. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.

In Figure 9, the peak of an event's heat coincides with the trough of another event's heat, with no time difference, indicating that a unified batch of water troops has been assigned to the task and launched a new offensive. The professionalization of black PR is evident: several hot searches appear simultaneously on the list, which attract attention, explain science, stir up controversy, shift perspective, influence cognition, mislead judgment, arouse emotions, and manipulate decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, with precise and detailed strategic planning, considering all elements of the spread of opinion transmission.

来到店里就开始一系列的骗术。我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

 [/INST] When I arrived at the store, they started a series of scams. I was the first time there, only to show them my floor plan, and they didn't even go to check the actual size of the house. They were able to give me a quote for my 135-square-meter house for 7 million yuan just by looking at their materials, and I didn't even know what brand of materials they were using. Their second scam was that as soon as you paid the deposit, you would be trapped and couldn't leave (once the money was paid, it was impossible to leave unless you had enough experience and could argue with them).
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。他给我的报价有很多问题7万不包括水电改造，不包括任何门和橱柜 浴室，而这三个就是基装的费用大头。

 [/INST] I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, and then they invited their so-called manager to tell me that if I paid the deposit today, I would get a certain discount. This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being scammed. At the time of confusion, I paid more than ten thousand deposits. The quotation he gave me had many problems. Seven thousand did not include the cost of water and electricity renovation, and did not include any doors, cabinets, and bathrooms, but these three were the main costs of the basic construction.

 [/INST] The Deputy Director of the Transportation and Communications Department of the Ministry of Transport introduced that several provinces, including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, have established 10 green comprehensive service areas on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This has been widely recognized by ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River transportation. The establishment of green comprehensive service areas on the Yangtze River is another milestone event in the construction of Yangtze River green transportation. The reception of Yangtze River ship pollution materials and the improvement of navigation services have been significantly enhanced. According to the introduction, green comprehensive service areas provide comprehensive production and living services for large ships and crew members, helping to solve the "urgent difficulty and anxiety" problem faced by crew members.
