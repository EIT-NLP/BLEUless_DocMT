The product cost less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the product value. I am a large customer, so it's not a problem for me.
You just need a number or instruction on how I should label the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€. Today it costs 179€. I find that honestly quite frustrating.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it for a better price, or is there another option for a refund?
I generally believe that it is not fair to ask children to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings. However, I think it is good for older siblings to help take care of the younger ones to some extent. They can keep an eye on them, help them out, bring them a drink, etc.
They learn responsibility by helping in the family and being involved. As long as they are still young enough to be children, I see no problem. If your K1 can handle it alone for a short time and it's okay for him, then that's good too.
You can best determine if it is suitable for your children. It is not the case that he should wrap K2 and accompany him for hours during sleep. From a legal standpoint, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement also comes from there. If something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would indeed be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you want to take is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of the book again! I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but the title just won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows it... The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of history, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his feral cats. The case is taken over by a detective who, after a brief investigation, realizes that the caretaker was treated by a therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety. The detective has a small niece who also has anxiety (of fire) and ends up at this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet. However, it turns out that this therapist is actually running an underground therapy group where patients have a chip planted in their heads that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients ultimately end up killing themselves in the most extreme way possible. (A woman jumps out of a window, another drives intentionally to her death)
This is how the fear is presented in the book as "the fight". At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with fire. That's how the rough plot I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If someone knows about this action or even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi. I have to contact my husband, but that might take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
The child, four years old, has a wooden splinter under their thumbnail (outside). They have tried to pull it out with a tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp. It didn't click and it hurt. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
There's no chance left. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

After my voucher is no longer extended due to a claim that did not reach me, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it somewhere else where customer service is better and I don't have to worry about making mistakes and not getting anything. What should I do with this number?
Due to Omicron: Johnson will push for booster shots In order to ensure new Omicron cases, politics and science in Great Britain. By New Year, all eligible adults in England should receive an impf offer.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will accelerate the booster vaccine rollout faster than previously planned due to rapidly increasing Omikron cases in England. Every adult in England will have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson announced in a pre-recorded video message to his constituents on Sunday evening. The previous target date was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing a crisis with the Omicron variant, so it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, said Johnson. The good news is that the protection level can be increased with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let's get boosted now!", Johnson said. On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were recorded in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3137. This was an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am for the fact that everyone presents themselves with pronouns. I have sent out an application. Today I received an invitation for a conversation via email.
I will reply to the email. However, unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a more complicated one. I have looked it up and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it is either a man or a woman.
I don't know how to write this email now. Can someone please help me? I'm a foreigner and I don't want to step on any toes.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. Four of them are going. Only the one that I bought today is not going.
It seems that the chair had an invisible defect in sales. How can such a damage to the upholstery occur after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG# it tries. But it has not worked for about 14 days.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books online and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were none left. Now they are available again and I would like to add 2 chairs to my order and have you bill me for it.
The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will write something detailed about domestic violence. I just have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence frequently due to professional reasons. A theme that bothers me a lot and unfortunately occurs too often is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or we think we cannot help them. It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
However, there are fewer things that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations. I see the blue stains, the blood, the desperate eyes... But even in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving behind the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it. What I always want to make clear to everyone, even though it's sometimes very close to my tears, is that it's worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. It becomes easier that way, but never. Please, always remember that you are valuable without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the point of the series based on "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking setup: "Arcane", the series based on the "League of Legends" video game universe, was recently released on Netflix. Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim At least youngster Johannes Patrick was absent. Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, John Patrick, the trainer of Ludwigsburg, looked back on the cup loss in early October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have something anger in our stomach." However, this anger did not subside after the game - on the contrary, it increased even more due to the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Bundesliga basketball. Moreover, the way of appearance was even more disappointing than the naked result.
A statistic can be called to represent the entire dilemma: The three-quote was only 13%, with 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - are there any more questions? The answer from John Patrick: "We were not concentrated enough after the win in Tenerife and did not manage to implement what we had trained." Specifically, moving the ball.
Sebastian Gleim's opponent reacted differently: "Winning the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg is a great game," said the happy coach. "It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people." Although only 750 spectators were allowed in the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, they were worth their money.
Last but not least, thanks to BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team. "The best point guard I've ever trained," praised Gleim. Meanwhile, in Patrick's team, the players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to perform throughout the game.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and come within eight points, after they had already fallen behind 39:59. Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also contributed twelve points. Fortunately, there is still a lot of time left for squabbling.
The Riesen received the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (8 pm), with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg beforehand.
We had an earlier email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I had already registered several months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected. We have legally informed ourselves again and resubmitted them for this reason.
We had already registered a year ago.
Max Raabe is 59 years old and he manages to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 1920s and 1930s. Currently, he is on tour with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he can perform it.
Max Raabe had originally wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on this Sunday. However, nothing came of it. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order", in order to contain the Corona virus.
Max Raabe, the 59-year-old singer, has announced on his website (www.palast-orchester.de) that other performances he had planned during the Advent season will have to be postponed. The artists plan to make up for the dates they missed in January due to the pandemic. Born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates. Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of popular songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has received numerous awards.
Max Raabe's live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second spot on the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013). He has managed to move from niche to mainstream. Dressed elegantly, with his blonde hair tightly combed and labeled, Max Raabe is a well-known figure in the current German-speaking music scene.
The program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to receive a small sample of the furniture wood in advance? So that we can match it with existing furniture and check if it matches color-wise before making a purchase.
It's still not working. I can only see the cover but not turn the pages.
Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing The new Federal Minister for Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been proposed in a popular vote in Berlin. "With expropriation, no new housing units are created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to ensure that tenants have security so that their rent remains affordable in the next few years. A diverse mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing associations is actually the best protection against monopoly formation. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the rental referendum.
If the situation does not calm down, Geywitz held talks with the FDP in the coalition government about further strengthening the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rental index. I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in payment. Unfortunately, the product is no longer available. Do you know when it will be back in stock?
Or if it will come again? #PRS_ORG# with space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
The coupon sounds great, then I will add a thank you for the quick clarification to the new order!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on my finger. That's an absolute audacity.
At least 100 deaths due to tornados in Kentucky During a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been drawn through the USA. Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone. On the night before Saturday, several tornados caused severe damage in the USA and may have resulted in up to 100 deaths. The storms left a approximately 320 kilometer long trail of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear of that state said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had passed through, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone. Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that this is possible. He counts up to a hundred deaths in the state of Kentucky alone, and the official numbers are increasing every hour.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# has been sold out. That's too bad. Will it still be produced?
Or is she completely out of stock? Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When would you like to sign up? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I will have to cancel the order!
I understand, can I place the order for the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had submitted the contact form or given a return and wanted to inquire if it arrived or was processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination incentives and change advertising slogans While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination incentive, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees financial incentives for vaccination. This aligns them with the Social Partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today are calling for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans to call for vaccinations - in the German model - is intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company he had criticized. That doesn't improve his situation any better than yours. Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year. He obviously hasn't stuck to his old job and has looked for something else. You can do that too.
And even though he didn't find you good back then, that's okay. He didn't find his job good either. There are too many variables.
Please stop the cancellation. That will then be really relevant. I am taking a screen shot.

Help with the first player campaign Boron! I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure over the Griffon's Pass and want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players.
We are playing DSA 5. The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am here, writing the introductory adventure and stumbling already at the first encounter with my own feet. The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-See.
There, the further development of the plot should take place. Some miles away from the village, a group of Goblins should ambush the hero and lure them into a trap. I want to give the player character the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in different ways: by persuading, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early, or whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed If they are not noticed, the goblins ambush the hero in a hollow way and flank him with three bows on the left and right, while two with spears stop the cart. If there is a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be found unconscious and subsequently by the son of the village schoolteacher, a half-elf, and healed. The cart is of course gone.  2. If an unavoidable defeat is certain, this half-elf with two of his servants comes to the aid of the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great. How does God ex Machina from Solution 2 fit in? Is the encounter as an introduction to the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.  EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips. I will definitely consider many of your ideas and now have even more confidence in my narratives.
I have rebuilt the lamp again. And put it back together again. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.

Here was the lower part, so quasi the part with the storage space damaged. Will everything be picked up again or just the storage space part?
I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1. Hello F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing, so I wanted to take a break from this post. First of all, today, during the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show on time.
Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the time plan were far behind the planning, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision. It seems, however, that due to legal reasons the F1 priority is enjoyed and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here had no choice. Stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcasted the end of the race.
Despite a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule violation by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was a possibility of deviation. In my opinion, such fundamental rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a Pay-TV channel. It's also not the first time they've had to guess what's allowed or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. But honestly, I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL even more. There are constant stupidities that both of them do, which make them look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one brings a lot of chaos to the comments, which he apparently doesn't take seriously. Last but not least, advertising takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as we can hear at F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary comes directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel. Although we have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they still broadcast, except for advertising. So at least the grandiose F1 season makes less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion once.
"To here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, Messing und mehrfarbiges Glas x 1"
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it hasn't been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and haven't received anything. The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email and she hasn't responded yet.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them has already shown a defect (the material has a hole on the front of the stool). I need help.
Lüfterpumpen are perfect for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium. Additionally, it is possible to operate a filtration system using air lifters. We offer this series in 3 different variations.
Look at the end of the offer in the table. There you can compare the services. If the pumps are strong enough, the entire plant can be operated with them.
If one has a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable to attach multiple outlets. The MK-series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. Blowers, on the other hand, can be used to add an accent to the aquarium, such as a hood (available in our shop) or a decoration that converts air bubbles into a function, like a treasure chest, shell, or something similar.
The MK-series has a special, soundproof construction and therefore produces low operating noises. The installation is very simple. The blower pump is connected to an exhaust port via a 4/6 mm air hose...and it's ready to go.
The blower pump should be at the same level or higher than the water surface, and placed outside. If the blower pump is lower than the water level, a return ventil should be placed between them. Simply cut the air hose and insert the ventil in between.
This would prevent it if water were to flow backwards, which runs water from the basin through the pump... If the blower pump were placed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days on eBay, we pack and pick up the packages daily. If everything runs smoothly, it goes very quickly. We just want to take a little precaution so that no one gets upset, just in case it takes a little longer.
It's like not everyone understands all the employees who work in the logistics industry...of course, there's no Corona here. Please don't judge them negatively just because the delivery is delayed. That's entirely the fault of the delivery services. We often complain about these services, even though we say they're having a tough time right now.
This is also very different regionally. Be nice to no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order yellow with or without armrests? Can we also order the legs in bright colors here?
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, sent his daughter and a TV moderator into space. The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers took a short trip into space on the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin on Saturday.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas. Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly trained astronauts upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the founder of Amazon. According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds in space and reached a height of 107 kilometers. The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), for whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: spaceflight engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket. Laura Shepard Churchley remembered the mission of her father after the short flight. He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
The 74-year-old said with a laugh, "You're just so lucky to have flown." Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm. He would love to go back to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" reaches a height of 100 kilometers during its flight. The rocket system "New Shepard" flies mostly autonomously. During the flight, the capsule separated from the rocket reached a height of approximately 100 kilometers above the Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above Earth as the boundary to space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight from Blue Origin: In the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman. In the second in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was there, who became world-famous with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics are accusing Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism with little scientific research interest for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
With a simple button press, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain lit in a fixed color or play through its entire color palette. When set to change color, the stone maintains a light color for about a minute before smoothly transitioning to the next decorative color. The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp ensures durability throughout the year.
In a snowy environment, the light shines particularly well - as long as the light duration is shortened as soon as the days get shorter. Please only pay attention in winter that no snow affects the solar module in its function. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh-Akku in the standard Mignon (»AA«)-format, which can be easily replaced when needed.
You can get a suitable replacement battery from our webshop and extend the usage time of your decorative lights further.

I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite interesting. Even in the lab, I don't get bothered. I had already completed the anorganic chemistry practical before this. Of course, I had also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies. At that time, I thought I would study Biochemistry until I got my promotion.
Currently, I have doubts, especially when it comes to career prospects. On the one hand, we always hear about great career opportunities and how sought-after the profession is. On the other hand, we constantly hear about unemployed biologists and unbelievably poorly paid jobs. That's why I would really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?  2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?  3) What did you study/what kind of training did you complete?
4) Would you do it all again? Thank you for your answers! I am currently unsure and considering whether to drop out of my studies and pursue a vocational training as a Fachinformatikerin in 2022.
If you have experiences, write them down too :)
The topic of extra stress before holidays and weekend ended came up last week for me. Now I have to use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore, start a post now. Not only during big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our business. It seems like there is also stress before holidays plus bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, which in Switzerland is called "Aufahrt." On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official. Last week, therefore, there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What was going on last week? Stress everywhere. Piles of emails that had to be sent out before leaving, tasks here and there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend.
Because... yes because? Because "next week then" sounds so far away and that can't be? Or because people are so serious in a shortened week that they want to accomplish as much as in a normal one?
I was not only stressed on Wednesday, but also completely exhausted. What is the point of this self-torture because of holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress came unexpectedly, the colleagues were all quite independent. My question is simply: Are we like that, the Swiss? Is that our reformed-evangelical nature?
Do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is excited for Christmas in Thuringia, even though she doesn't have any gifts yet. "The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer, Hit Radio FFH.
She would align herself with the festival by baking and whistling with her son. "I love it," said Catterfeld. However, she still had some things to do before the contemplative days: "For the first time, I still have no gifts, I finally have to let go."
Nekton-Bio supports a smooth feather shedding and feather regrowth process. Nekton-Bio contains all the necessary vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg biotin per kg. Nekton-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
Most of the feather damages that occur in bird-keeping are due to nutritional errors. Since feathers are made of protein-rich material, it is essential for the formation of a healthy feather coat that the bird has a rich and balanced protein diet. For a proper metabolism, the daily ration must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals. The composition of NEKTON-Bio takes into account the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds and adjusts it. During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
Nekton-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily mixed into drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I have found the function, unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are mine. I received a bed from you. However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet. What do we do now? I cannot build the bed.
The middle section is held by two feet, unfortunately they are produced incorrectly. The middle section does not fit into the planned holding device. Therefore, I will receive new ones.
When will they finally be shipped? No flat ones. That's what the assembly instructions say, they were just too narrow.
"But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose. They are not flat for me."
Could I receive this? Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem again?
There was a house fire in Oberbayern that resulted in two people being lightly injured and significant damage. The estimated damage is in the millions of euros, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech). Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect an intentional arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
Then she comes much later, and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccination photo Uğur Şahin, the CEO of Biontech, released a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021. Prior to this, he had not publicly stated his vaccination status.
Now, the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination. The illness of a friend moved him, said Şahin. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the Coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I was not vaccinated. In reality, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, wrote Şahin on LinkedIn on Friday. "For some time now, my friends have been pushing me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors," he added.
Up until now, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him. However, a call last week changed his mind: "I was deeply saddened when I learned that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is battling a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The classmate and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask for reasons. "The most common reason seems to be fear, which is often fueled by incorrect information and mistrust," Şahin continued.
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences. There is an interview circulating on the Internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated.
"At that time, it was not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin. There was a prioritization in Germany for vaccination. Now, the prioritization has been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has reportedly gotten vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power in several towns in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening the lights went out: no power anymore and in many cases also no heating. A fire had disabled the transformer station.
After a fire with heavy damages in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-District in North Rhine-Westphalia had to be without power for 24 hours. On Friday evening, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents in several towns due to the fire. Westnetz, the power supplier, reported that many emergency generators were in operation until the large-scale outage was finally completely restored in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood help. The supplier thanked the affected for their patience and the helpers for their commitment.
We are very aware that the past 24 hours have brought significant restrictions. We would like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts, said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Division, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damages will take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally restore some connections at first, he explained.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company. Power is flowing again. The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 pm, according to Westnetz's reports, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation.
There were extensive cleaning and repair works needed. In parallel with this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level was created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply was restored.
Since Saturday 8 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had power again. Further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid would have been gradually connected from 9:30 pm. Since 11:15 pm, the last people affected by the outage would have had power.
Over 80 monitors from Westnetz and partner companies were in action. The authorities called for neighborhood help on Saturday afternoon after building a backup power supply for important buildings. "It's important now for citizens to take care of their neighbors, especially the elderly or those living alone, and inform the local fire department if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed medical equipment that was dependent on electricity or who required medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out. Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
The topic is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also had a beautiful day and please stay healthy ❤️
I can't mount the underside on the tabletop. It's custom #NAME#. There are 3 variations of it.
We wanted to get tables with a diameter of #NUMBER#, but we got ones with a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however, I cannot combine them and therefore shorten them. Can you help me further? Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback.
Yes, that's really simpler! Then let's do it that way! Can you send me the return receipt via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried to do it before the chat. However, I had not restarted the E-PRS_ORG before making the purchase.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low invoice almost unexpected. That means we are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination: Riiber Wins The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have finished on the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia. Defeated once again, the duo had to give way to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already built up a large lead after the ski jumping.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER# When will the money be transferred to my account?
Yes, we have both made a new version and are using version 4.5... It could be that they have already encountered problems with it.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it. When I try to open it, the message comes up: ups! This document cannot be opened.
The file may be incorrect. Please report it to the customer service. As far as I can see, it's an epub file with the #PRS_ORG# hashtag. Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now? I have to work in between!
To ensure even and clean color application, it is recommended to clean the building blocks with a little soap water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, then rinse with clear water and let them dry. Before using a new color on the model for the first time, it is advisable to practice with 2 to 3 strokes. You can do this on the inner side of the building blocks, which will not be visible later, or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the building material should be done with a brush evenly, next to next. Light overlapping of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid quick back-and-forth wiping with a brush. This results in unrealistic-looking surfaces. A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the light colors. The dark ones could later become transparent. Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
If the metal parts are mixed with normal colors, it can result in unpleasant metal stripes. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you sandblast them. The models achieve their original appearance through decals or peel-off images.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names and decorations on automobiles: Decals give the model its final shape. Put the decals in the right order while the parts are still easily accessible. It is easier to apply the cockpit of an airplane before it is installed in the fuselage.
The right tools, such as scissors, tweezers, and awl, are just as important as time, patience, and a steady hand when it comes to adhesive bonding. Cut each required decal individually and carefully align them. Decals are also known as water-transfer images because you wet their backside with water until the carrier paper turns dark through the moisture.
Then you gently slide the image a little off the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you had previously dampened). While holding the decal in place on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Be careful: Always check first if the image is in the right position before completely peeling it off the paper, otherwise it may stick to your finger, knit or even tear.

I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and find my place again until I know where I left off. On Saturday, I had already communicated with you before.
Can I receive this via email? Also for all three packages? Because the lamp arrived at my place in three individual packages.
Thank you anyway! Then I'll go shopping somewhere else as soon as the money is back. Will I be able to get it back easily?
Hello everyone, we were in children's wish treatment for some time, now that it's about the billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands in the way.  Translation:  Hello everyone, we were in children's wish treatment for some time, now that it's about the billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands in the way.
Step by step: We had requested the children's wish procedure from the PKV in advance and received approval for three attempts. The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was covered by the health insurance. Some time later, we tried to have another child and went through two unsuccessful attempts, which we did not yet claim from the health insurance. We then requested the cost coverage again from the health insurance and were granted three more attempts.
After several additional attempts (we have conducted more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive ones should be covered by the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts. The explanation: With pregnancy/birth the other 2 attempts of the first approval fall away. The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when the treatment need no longer exists." The questions to the experts in the round here: * Who is right, the PKV (only 3 reimbursements will be refunded) or us (there are 5 reimbursements to be refunded)?
* If the PKV had informed us that with a birth the further attempts would fail, would it have been necessary? * Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (caused by closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts could give their opinion here. Thank you very much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variations via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
In order. We will not order anything from them anymore. If they add up the sales from me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they obviously have lost good customers.
They can forward this to their manager. This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been ordered and now you are telling me that I have to send the thing back first. I can't do anything about it, can I? Please see the screenshot of what my colleague wrote.
It is clear and obvious that the repayment was ordered and I have not yet received a repayment through #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account. We won't do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred after several months. An office chair must withstand normal use. Otherwise, they cannot sell it as an office chair.
The guarantee of 24 months is valid regardless of that.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging. I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transportation company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG# products. These products are advertised with additional chairs to purchase, but unfortunately we cannot find them at your store. Can you help?
The theme of the week: The best low budget films  What exactly constitutes a low budget film, there is no general definition with precise budget boundaries. According to Wikipedia:
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture made with minimal funding from a major film studio or private investor. You can find plenty of low-budget films online, such as on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it? And what didn't you like about it at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completely furnished two apartments with your furniture. I wanted to get the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle. The delivery time was extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you with friendly greetings. There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes, is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...then I will give up again, because it simply doesn't work here. Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU The EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong. However, the costs would be very high and would result in massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation, said the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP). This state of limbo - Belarus is not completely insignificant, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Human Rights Convention, ruled Bossong.
It appears that there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stance against this, it is coming at the cost of fundamental rights. This development is also weakening the unity in the Union.
"She cannot assert herself when a member state puts its thing into its head, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU's border protection agency, access to its border. In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy on the border with Belarus, as Bossong says: A fundamental agreement on asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line 'border protection, border protection, border protection' has been strengthened. Another attempt to cross the border."
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus. A spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday that 55 migrants were arrested and returned to the border in the night. Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor. In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had managed to overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU. Poland and Lithuania have closed off sections of their borders, according to media reports.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country. Additionally, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving. According to Bossong, the most effective element of the EU's reaction is the pressure on the airlines.
"The EU has shown its market power and proven its determination to act with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures. Minsk must also consider the internal political costs. The Belarusian society is not prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly sends thousands of people through the country."
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 race in Abu Dhabi, claiming that Max Verstappen broke two rules during the race.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year. A protest was filed against a supposed infringement by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety-Car phase, where he was allegedly overtaken illegally. A second appeal was lodged against the race result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed properly. Hamilton overtook on the last lap in his Mercedes and won his first Formula-1 title. The maneuver happened shortly after the end of a Safety-Car phase, during which the Dutch driver overtook the car in front of him.
I am testing it. I am talking to the bank and reporting back to you again, thank you for the support.

According to the park, members and season ticket holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were drink coupons and sausages. The roller coasters shone through the trikots red and white on this day. Füchsle, Ed Euromaus, and many red-white helium balloons created the perfect atmosphere, as the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was once again shown how well the partnership works. Shining fans could be seen, who were having fun together on the roller coaster, confirming this, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

I had a huge anger with you then, when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# suit.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Home" as part of the LiteraTour Nord reading series at the sold-out Blue Note on Friday. She also served as the moderator. She is divorced, lives in a house by the sea, and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or anything similar. My question is whether my request has been received.
It's not everyone who has time for your wrapped-up chat and falsely delivered cheap goods from China. Your mistake is to fix it and not all from our household. Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order for the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label. We haven't received the email yet. We want to deliver the package to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me with friendly greetings.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an antisemit doesn't mean anything. It's like when a bird says it doesn't have anything against foreigners. They both won't admit it.
"However, my colleague constantly reproduces anti-Semitic messages. If you want to distance yourself, then you should just completely ignore it. Yes, then you are just as unserious as my colleague."
"Anyone who fundamentally questions evolution is just completely lost. But since you're a creationist, you have to believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense."
And with that, you are a science hater and not to be taken seriously as a colleague.
To obtain an optimal viewing field, the eyepiece should be as close to the eye as possible. The specially designed aplanatisch-achromatisch lens system allows you to use the eyepiece practically without any registration and color errors even in the peripheral zone. Lupes are often marked with magnification specifications.
These specifications apply only to exactly specified conditions that are rarely consistent with usage requirements. To use your magnifier optimally, we kindly ask you to consider the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (refer to the user manual in the packaging). On the optical surfaces of all optical instruments, including impact lenses, light reflections occur.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When the optimal usage conditions are met - keeping the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable. For more information, please refer to the enclosed user manual (available in both German and English).

Hello dear #PRS_ORG# team, I have already registered with you as a customer contact using the phone number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was different before. You cannot deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the town of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers at the Tannenverkauf. One time, a man had to drive back home alone because he and his partner couldn't agree on which tree to buy.
Every year, he plants about 2000 pieces for this purpose. The 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations. This makes the Christmas season a little more fun, he says.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, I'm out as a customer! After all, I received a defective delivery and now I've paid the full price for it.
Then I would evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which one is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both are made of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit, and therefore they have their names.
In English, a possible translation for "Dreher" could be "spinner". However, "spinner" doesn't sound as appealing as "Dreher" does in German.
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks now. Unfortunately, I am now having problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit without any issues, except for a few failures. The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module connected to it also receives these speeds. However, on the other DLan module, which transmits WiFi, the full 500 Mbit is no longer received, but the further away from the module I am in the house, the less that is received (for example, using a power socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the first floor (~45 Mbit) than before. I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology. This was slightly better than DLan, but there were also similar large losses here.
Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost when using glass fiber through the power line? And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really frustrated as to why I created an extra account here. Therefore, I would be even more happy to receive an answer.
When it is time to change the checking account, whoever thought about it, now there is finally peace with the checking accounts, they see themselves deceived. While many banks used the fall to once again confirm the fee increases of the past with various tricks on their customers, the interest-free periods for negative interest rates are also decreasing.
The German Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 Euros long. Now it has halved the interest-free amount and even quartered it for daily interest. In the first step, the limit was only reduced for customers of the corporate savings branch Postbank - to 50,000 Euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 Euros for daily interest accounts.
However, these lower rebates now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request. This applies not only to new contracts but also to "newly struck individual agreements with existing customers." The Commerzbank had previously fallen below a limit of 50,000 Euros, which still applies, as is the case with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB has reduced its interest rates in two steps, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros. Despite this, more than 100 banks have now offered a interest rate of 25,000 euros or less, according to the internet portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros, but there is still a dispute with the consumer centers, which have filed a lawsuit against this regulation in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin.
Currently, there are discussions in the banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the upper instances were to declare negative interest rates generally invalid and millions of bank customers had to be refunded.
The table delivered was for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people. The underneath is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston has an entire army of beauty staff. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood. But her life is like a rollercoaster.
Jennifer Aniston (52) has been named one of the most influential women of the year by US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter". This success is largely due to her hard work and dedication. A whole team of assistants, stylists and trainers take care of her appearance.
Anyway, Aniston, treat yourself to a chip today (yes, that's right: a single chip from the jar). Despite the fact that both male and female fans still flock to her heart, it's actually a miracle. Maybe it's because she's just bad luck with good fortune - and still searching for true love.
And the desire for a baby has been crossed off the list. Previously, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother. That hurt her.
The people who asked didn't know what was personally going on with me, medically, why I couldn't. It was really hurtful. I hope that success and fame will bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to retire Kimi Räikkönens farewell from Formula 1 was even quieter than expected. Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled his glove off and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it. After a driving error and a slight touch of the tires, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before even completing half of the race distance. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, as the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye. Räikkönens greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari. He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from the pole 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Nolte wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man bobsleigh - Sports The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot. "I had calculated it once, I had to win nine and a half victories per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who won two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
He first defended against Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by moving from third place to first place, a difference of 5 hundredths of a second. Then he made some changes to the material setup and on Sunday he increased his lead by 0.30 seconds. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he overtook the British Brad Hall.
The third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive win. The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was traveling for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after being in second place previously.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in 4th place in the first race and ended up in 8th place. "If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it that way too," said Lochner. Nolte won at home - Jamanka on the podium.
At her home track, Laura Nolte won her third season's victory in the women's two-man bobsleigh on Sunday. On Saturday, she had to settle for fourth place in the monobob. On Sunday, she raced to victory in the women's three-man bobsleigh with Anschieberin Deborah Levi, as part of a German sweep. Mariama Jamanka, the two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion from BRC Thüringen, finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked the first podium spot alongside her Olympic qualification this winter. The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on third place. For me, it was super cool, the first podium spot in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing forward, but there's also a lot to do around it." Jamanka was a bit annoyed by the not entirely error-free rides, but she said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the bedding in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!! What should I do?
I didn't receive it yet and therefore couldn't redeem it, that's why I finally asked. Due to Corona, I had other problems last year and never had time for it. And now it says he's expired, which really upset me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare chair.
I would like to return it and then reorder it since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting on March 16th? There was no information about such a longer delivery time on your website.
No until I click on it, there will be an extra field with the message.
Yesterday, my colleague took it away. Why is it a problem for me today? I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered items.
However, we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one, and not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello lovely girls and women, I have something I just want to write and maybe it goes for one or the other as well...
I am 24, have PTSD, a full-time student, and a dog mom - except for the fact that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child. My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with his shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns). He's also cold and we don't see each other as often (1-2 times a week) as I find it very difficult to meet my needs for affection and love. My dog is sick, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I massaged him with a warm lamp.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is just gone for a month. Now we also have to do housework, which we of course divide up. But even cooking is just too much work for me...
My PTSD illness is currently well-adjusted, I am halfway through treatment and getting better. Not great, but I'm getting better and almost symptom-free. My university is currently requiring a lot from me (for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have done nothing, and tomorrow afternoon I have an anatomy lecture for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is written in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left. So my week goes like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday. Only until the vacation begins. Only until the weekend.
Only until... And so it goes on forever. I believe, I am just so stressed, that I need these spiritual anchors, otherwise I'll go crazy.
I feel guilty and "chaotic" somehow, but I don't know how to do it... Does it go the same way for you? Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
"I am truly infinitely grateful, I can't put it into words. I don't know if I would have survived my captors otherwise. I think there's also something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here..."
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately it's a different color and the surface is scratched, and the table leg has an impression. The first delivery's color was exactly like on the website. We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me? If we exchange the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th. It was sent two other times, but it was not confirmed.
Mal war komplett anderes: Ich habe damals in der Schule festgestellt, dass viele Religionslehrer nicht an Gott glauben und es für sie nur ein weiteres Fach ist wie Mathe oder Erdkunde. Für mich war das immer etwas seltsam, vielleicht auch weil ich christlich erzogen wurde und ich so immer irgendwie geglaubt habe. Wie stehst du dazu?  Translation:  At that time, it was completely different: I noticed in school that many religion teachers did not believe in God and saw it as just another subject like math or geography. For me, it was always strange, maybe because I was raised in a Christian way and always believed in some way. How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also tell me about your work and study colleagues with different attitudes. Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional life, and it makes sense to separate them. There are also lesson plans, etc.
"But it is also strange to find a physics teacher who does not believe in the theory of relativity. What brings one to want to teach religion when one does not believe in it? Is it to preserve culture or something?"
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write often English, I understand it well too. This is already very long, then I would avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a feedback soon, latest by the beginning of the next week. Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Hello everyone, I'm looking for a movie from my childhood (I'm 24).
I believe it was a film for young people. In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern era (real world).
To the other the past (or the realm of the dead)(uncertain). Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman. And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a story is created. The antagonist is also a soldier from the land of the dead who wants to bring the woman to that land to be able to live himself. I think the transition is also the graveyard of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If you have something to say, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1. Almost there: still living :D Relax.
This child holds out much more than one thinks. Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, go in and out more often, but no constant monitoring. That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress. No pillows.
Ahso and our had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket. Observe your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to lift something from the stomach? Or is it directly in front of the face on the mattress? You can tell by this whether everything is in order.
We have also grown up, and when my husband came into the world, it was just like that, you put the kids on your belly to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased many articles. But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to you about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#) and I haven't received any feedback yet. The right drawer doesn't fit in the wardrobe.
Please contact me as soon as possible. The drawer is currently not usable.
To make it clear. RBTV has promised a lot. And yes, I know myself, not everything can be kept.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV. But it's just that the politics of this broadcaster is now completely submerged. Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then they still go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: One wanted "to be no running column." What are you now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to bring their BilloMerch to elite fans. And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Naturally, they apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can certainly continue to insult people. A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy tries to make ashes out of the exploded rented rooms at the expense of the action. How can one find anything good in this?
It's great when you like it, I find it terrible.
I would like a callback, as the delivered wooden table was defective. Damage caused by careless delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
If you have a stomach ache or just want to cuddle - my little warm friend is very versatile. Cherry pits are a traditional remedy for warm applications because cherry pits absorb and release heat very well. The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when it doesn't go well. The cherry pit cushion with connection is only suitable for the following application areas: before warming up the cushion on unusual odors, stains or burns, check and immediately dispose of if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the socket before heating it in the microwave. Heat it in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!). Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the cushion by shaking it.
After inserting the inner cushion. At the beginning of heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated use. Always follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can cause damage (fire and burning hazard!).

Darmstadt is dreaming of a return to the Football Bundesliga after winning in Düsseldorf. Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
In Ingolstadt, it's not going well even under the third trainer. There is joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, happiness in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead? My laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, about 3 years old) couldn't be charged through the power supply last night. I bought a new power supply about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought that a power cord would be enough to operate it. Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the power cord plugged in. After that, I took out the battery, but nothing happened either.
Do you have ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode? Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to my room. How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair. However, I do not know how high the seat is.
Are you often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design! With a 20-liter capacity, it can easily accommodate larger photo equipment, which can be securely stowed away using the padded FlexFold panels.
And what you still need for everyday objects remains well-organized and separable from photography equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior space. With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack Series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and provide quick access to photography equipment at the same time.
It works with two options: conventionally through the zipper, which can be locked with the MagLatch closure system, or an excellent solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in messenger bags. In the zipper there is a metal locking mechanism with corresponding anchors on the front of the backpack. Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels": there are actually 4 anchors, securely locked, into which the locking mechanism can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you can simply take the top bar, which is usually less full, a lower one. The zipper and hook are also magnetic. So the backpack can be reliably closed without having to fasten the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other Fotorucksäcken in a fundamental way. In addition to the Deckelklappe, there is also a Reißverschlussöffnung on both sides of the rucksack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with a top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents! At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday practicality of the rucksack enormously. If you not only bring your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel gear with you.
In an everyday backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more details below) and store both items separately without any problems - and through the two side openings, you can access them independently. This way, you can also pull the backpack from the right side to reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday items remain secure in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way. Comfortable, adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is completely made from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents remain dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# informed me yesterday that they had confirmed the contact request from the shipping company for the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table.
I haven't received any news yet. I request immediate processing. I'm writing to the third support staff member now, but none of them have gotten me any further than a promise that I'll receive a confirmation email.
The text is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It's clear to see when the wardrobe can be delivered again? For me, it's not an option to keep it like this.
It works. Thank you so much for your help. Wish you all a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were on January 12, 2021.
I received a completely different lamp than what I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back. And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not know and did not have the opportunity to settle it in a timely manner. But the damage, I accept as a customer.
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who values reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake pads are cast and then mechanically processed (machined and cut). All tested pads are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain pads and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created which focuses on the growth of the disc according to the properties of the original mounting. The resulting tested discs ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness. Additionally created openings increase the cooling effectiveness of the disc, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and rotors.
The aesthetic properties of our painted sheets highlight the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern tip of the American River. Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, news of it spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far, making Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country. Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted a piece of the wealth of the land.
For many it was: “Coloma or Bust” (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself. You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and adjacent areas. You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory. You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources, and build a tableau that works for you (so-called "engine building"). The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments. Coloma plays over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their choice is revealed and they place their pawns on the corresponding locations. If a location has the most pawns, it gets a freeze!
This deactivates half of the base - which reduces the possible actions there. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvermen. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The bidder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round, changing the available actions. This continues until the bidder has moved five times, or has covered each location once, and the year ends. There is a shootout, in which the players must defend Coloma against an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have enough cowboys steered and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards. If they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up on the graveyard. The game ends after the third shootout, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with the most points wins! For free shipping, I accept up to dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm for the shipping method, warehouse sending (games arrive). For all other methods, DPD is usually guaranteed and includes shipping tracking (games arrive, wrapped in flies and with packing paper).
If you are a collector, I can send you a cardboard box in a cardboard box for an additional fee of 2 euros, which is 100% guaranteed to have no printing presses.
"Why children are not tyrants" Document, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately.
Michael Winterhoff, a child psychologist, is often seen as a guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe. His book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) caused a heated debate about education. Now, former patients and education officials are raising serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to endure. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently. Our parents and other responsible people should never, never, never seek power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to enlarge the framework for the child as much as possible in the given situation. Brrr, I am still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss lifting test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals The health ministers of the states want to decide at their next meeting on a federal-wide lifting of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals. "We states need clarity quickly on whether and when the test requirement can be lifted for triple-vaccinated individuals," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, in "Bild am Sonntag."
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has announced that he will present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the upcoming Tuesday. - afp

Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS_ORG# account. Error message: Ups, an error has occurred. Purchase through the #PRS_ORG# website on the computer is not working.
I have updated account data. What could be the reason for this?
What you describe as *Awareness* is sensory perceptions under narcosis. These occur with a frequency of about 1 in 1000. The most common occurrence is hearing sounds/voices, less commonly seeing images, and almost never perceiving pain.
For this topic, relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that come with an increased rate of awareness, as we try to avoid very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the umbilical cord is cut. Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
"Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex had none. I have read his comment incorrectly."
The chair is unfortunately defective. Unfortunately, the 20 euros also do not help. These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for her to return the defective stool. This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard practice in the eCommerce industry. Please check again if she at least returns the defective stool.
We are selling the second chair privately. That means we will lose some money.
I already sent you an email that you haven't replied to. Could you please answer this question again. According to the order and invoice, the goods are to be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier is company #NAME#. I just called there. They told me that they can only deliver to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I would have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor. Who would I call then?
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle, who was 97 years old, has passed away. He had established a profile as a theater critic and as an intendant. Later, he wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle, who was 97 years old, passed away. There is still a new book on the table, freshly printed: "An Old Man Becomes Older". This is the heart-wrenching diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle had been leading until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author is dead. The last sentence in the book reads: "I acknowledge my debt to life here once again."
There are various types of pallets. One of the most common are Europalettes, standardized wooden pallets that are widely used as load carriers in the European region. They are certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
In 2020, according to statistics from Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria. The production value was approximately 79 million euros. The amount of pallets imported into Austria annually is not recorded.
New York City FC has won the Major League Soccer championship for the first time. After a 1-1 draw in the regular season against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the match in the penalty shootout with a score of 4-2.

"Rouladen Tips & Tricks I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash. It was served during Christmas and was incredibly delicious and buttery!"
Thank you again :) Now I have a taste for it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve. Tomorrow I will set up a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What happened to the books, or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#? My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I'll get there.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER# I was informed via email on 18.01 that the refund was successful. However, the money is still not in my account.

Where there is Christmas goose in Lübeck space For many people goose or duck belongs to Christmas days like the Christmas tree and gifts. Have you taken care of any feathers yet?
"Time is running out now. We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas goose in Lübeck."
The "Drive" of a guitar amplifier's preamp output plays a significant role in determining the warmth and fatness of the sound. This feature is perfectly executed by the valve reactor circuit. By adjusting the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can simultaneously set the desired volume level and the amount of distortion in your sound.
Additionally, the VT+ Series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL-Regler, which allows you to reduce the sound level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion. Furthermore, it is already noticeable that with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, you can also make a power reserve float smoothly when it suddenly gets loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, you can fully utilize the entire potential of the VT+ Series in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a boxing simulation, so you can get an "acoustic" sound impression when using headphones or direct recordings. You can connect a CD or MP3 player to the AUX jack, so you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuning device. If you spend an additional VFS5 foot pedal, you can call up the sounds comfortably with your feet, turn on/off the effect blocks, and tap the tempo of the corresponding effects. This is actually essential for live use.
VOX is taking another step into the future with its new power packages!
"That was also seen by others. Is there then a possibility to send the lamp back? Since it hangs too low over the dining table?"
Additionally, I would like to send them back. Can you help me further?
And the furniture? Do we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with an inheritance or a voucher. Sometimes I find a buyer for the furniture. But only if the items I don't need cost more than 1,000 Euros then it's a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in talks over nuclear deal According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations over a revival of the international nuclear deal. "Both sides are now close to agreeing on the issues that are on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, as reported by the Iranian news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated. The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building atomic weapons. The Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued on Thursday after a nearly one-week break.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations. However, a US delegation is present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony-Anhalt as the state with the highest coronavirus incidence in Germany. Currently, Thuringia has the highest incidence in the country, with a value above 1000.
Thuringia is the only state in Germany where the number of corona cases exceeded 1000 on Sunday. The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Sachsen, which had the highest incidence in the country until Sunday, the value was 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday, the incident in Thüringen had decreased slightly, but was still above 1000. In Thüringen, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within a day. On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals.
There can be delays in reporting during weekends. Additionally, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery starts in early March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print and attach it to the package and give it to the post office, is that right? Here do I need to click/point/fill in anything else?
I want to avoid exactly that, which is why I am writing to you. I would like to kindly request that you take care of the return shipping on your own. In my opinion, a return shipping fee of 8 euros is impudent.

If we look at the activity of the German Bundestag in the past months, we can conclude that it does not exist. We have entered a winter slumber and have extended the summer break for some months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what has happened? Most likely it is simply due to dissatisfaction, as shown by some things that have happened here and our general appearance. In recent days, there has been a growing impression that many people here are still enthusiastic about the Bundestag.
The community around the German Bundestag is being asked what they want to keep alive at this point. The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a pile of debris.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project. However, I would like to emphasize once again that everyone should participate, only then can this project have a future existence. We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can enter the server through this link. Goals: * How should the Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we present ourselves externally in the future? * How should new members be recruited?
* How do we create a fair election system? I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but it's not too bad, we'll figure it out in the end. If you have time and interest, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still to be delivered. Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for this purpose and not suitable for my taste. For this reason, I have already ordered a different hanger from you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it. I hope this will be returned and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# also come in large sizes, like 240/240 for example?
The #PRS_ORG# must ensure that the faulty wardrobe is picked up promptly. And I kindly request that you now arrange for a suitable packaging. I don't have any packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup - you must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how this will work.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me anytime by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for assembly? How long would I have had time to take care of this or make a decision about sending it back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? I had a conversation with a colleague I like today, who has lived vegetarian for a while and rarely eats meat now.
I was also a vegetarian for some years. When asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned step, I answered honestly. And I said that I thought for a long time that being a vegetarian would help animal welfare, but I eventually reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that on their side there was resentment, they defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and as vegetarians we reduce animal suffering. Now I'm wondering if my answer was too blunt?
How do you answer the question? Do you feel that as a vegan, you are quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without you intending to? It greets a harmonious vegan woman (;
This is not an exception as per Section 312d of the German Civil Code. Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am at the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my retoures not on site. Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately it cannot be changed. Can you please assign me an alternative pickup date?
From February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Water Rescue Weapon is equipped: Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a check for 45,000 euros to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus for the new water rescue vehicle of the Lahnsteiner Freiwilligen Feuerwehr. The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in service since November 2020, is 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in safety. I am happy that the state of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein. The equipment truck is used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of the seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill tasks under and over water in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, it is always expected that there will be an increase in missions: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book. I followed their recommendations, synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, but nothing worked.
I am a bit anxious because the whole action has taken up a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, so. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June. Can I enter a deadline in the order process?

Thank you for being here, I have also spent nearly a decade in public service in a similar role, we were also bearers of weapons in the executive, I don't want to go into it any further! The question of right and left I find always very simplified. Generally, one should say that of course the public servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, that should be clear to everyone.
It is clear that people in uniform and weapon carriers, regardless of their background, are naturally attractive to conservatives. However, it is also clear that these people will have difficulty dealing with reality if they are not used to it. Therefore, it is clear that these people must be relied upon, as they may save your life or end it for you. However, even these marginalized groups, although they may seem comical at first, are proud of Germany and feel that they are being treated unfairly by overly left-wing politics, even though this politics may seem to be working for them. Therefore, it is necessary to return to the right, as the police and military are also a cross-section of society, and extreme right-wingers can be found there, although they may openly express their opinions or plan state-threatening activities in the media, which is exaggerated and bothersome to me.
Naturally, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who have often been deployed overseas begin to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences. It also happens that like-minded individuals with a particular ideology meet and engage in a lively exchange of ideas. However, in my opinion, this is effectively combated through political education and enlightenment efforts aimed at the entire population.
Germany is so internationally entwined and that's good in my opinion because we wouldn't be able to afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side. Why should this come from England? As I ordered, it was not sold out.
I placed my order in November.
I received confirmation of your order in your response.
The issue is still with my order, which is no longer available. I had previously communicated with #NAME#. As an alternative, it is possible to deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black to Germany, or perhaps this basket is also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as my partner company.
However, on the edge of the wooden board are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
"Am I organized as a child? Hello, I have been dealing with a matter for a long time. I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but even in my lifetime, I have always had more bad than good luck in keeping my household permanently clean and organized."
There are always phases when everything stays still, and then and now it picks me up and I tidy up. But it's actually never so "that someone could spontaneously come to visit." My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time he loses household chores simply because of work and lack of interest.
The kitchen is cleaned regularly so that we can cook comfortably. Now, to my question, have you managed to raise your children in an orderly manner? We haven't done it yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me there is no motivation, it doesn't bother me so much, as long as there are no visitors and, for example, fresh clothes are always available and the kitchen is usable. Do you have a greater motivation when you have a child or do you remain lazy? I am looking forward to your answers.
The Flex System 2 offers an exclusive, new, and high-quality product with an anatomically formed cut that provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and enables nearly unrestricted movement. The preforming with special emphasis on the joints for improved movement (on the arm and knee joints) was added to the Focea Comfort 4. In the Flex System 2, the area covered by the Flex System was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Stretch-Panels without seams reduce friction (shoulders, elbow and knee joints) high-quality forms in the lower back region and in the step ensure a snug, perfect sitting position. Elastic 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar spine region increases flexibility around the back seam and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of heat protection. When positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body.
A seamless, thin (-2 mm) coating on the face of the helmet improves comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet). A soft, collar-located zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the casing or seams. Double flaps with a snap button connect an adjustable inner manschette with a soft, cashed Neoprene outer manschette.
45° Taper at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and load capacity during pulling. Long zipper at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort overall without a hood. Long G-Lock P rear zipper (overall without a hood) with a metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent).
Arm and leg cuffs with Neoprene reinforcements at all ends to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels are securely bonded with both outer and inner overlapping.
The outer casing has reinforced edges for greater load capacity, while the inner casing has cutouts for increased flexibility. The original Beuchat System was designed to secure the computer in place, specifically during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all popular wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality? I have completed an education in the field of software development and have been working for about a year now. However, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxious avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS). This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and accordingly I am shy. I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to carry on casual conversations and I have often been told that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe this has improved).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support. However, I don't know if the actual workday is as I imagine it, and it's difficult to find information about it online.
The AVPS is already causing problems for me in my job (emotionally), because every time something needs to be corrected in my code, it brings me down ("again, the simplest things are broken") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding them back with my dumb questions"/"they must think I'm incompetent" etc.). I think I'll encounter these problems in every job, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you get the sofa back? Because there was no confirmation for it.
"I am waiting for a pickup time. Please let me know what they will bring back!"
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, will the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorization for this book does not exist" appear if there are problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein in the egg that the bird consumes is broken down in its stomach-intestinal tract into individual amino acids. These amino acids are then used to build up the bird's own protein tissues, which are also needed for feather growth. Feather growth in nestlings and feather renewal in molting birds are very complex processes and are highly demanding on the animal's overall system. Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be given during breeding, as this can lead to disruptions in the reproductive process.
After this brief supply of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation). The protein in the feed is broken down by the bird in its stomach-intestinal tract into the individual amino acids, and from these, it builds up its own protein tissues, which it also needs for feather growth. Feather growth in nestlings and feather renewal in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are highly demanding for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be given during breeding, as it can cause disruptions in the hatching process. After the mandatory administration of NEKTON-Bio, it is recommended to switch back to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation). 1 gram of NEKTON-Bio per 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much water and soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water and food daily. A tablespoon (included) corresponds to 1 g of NEKTON-Bio. In case of severe feather damage, it may be necessary to give double or triple the dose of NEKTON-Bio at the beginning until the start of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is complete. Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry and without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
I apologize, but the chair will be sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months? In Germany, warranty claims are valid for 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and pictures were attached. Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the constitution. Hello r/LegaladviceGerman, I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled. Therefore, a felling request has been submitted to the community. An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the statutes.
However, the walnut is explicitly stated as a protected tree in the statute. Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not? On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear. Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any news, oh well, then I still have this sofa without any use. Could you perhaps offer me a legacy or a voucher?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I believe that the question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the roof delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Accident Report: A severe traffic accident occurred recently on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg. As reported by the police press alert at 14:03 (1:03 PM), a car collided with oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand. Good, then thank you again that it was so simple!
Advice and ideas for further professional life. Happy first Christmas to you! Unfortunately, my Christmas is only so-so, because my dear head just grinds everything that can be ground.
Before I start working here now, in short: I need advice and the best would be from people who somehow know my situation - so from you. I am currently doing the Ref as a beginner. Originally, I had studied something else and also worked in that area (at least to remain somewhat anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun. Sometimes I landed on teaching and was sure that's it - even though the framework conditions were clearly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that was okay with me. I'm now on my third "I'm googling other job postings."
And it's only half a year away. With the paintings in front of me, I always decided to keep going and at least finish the rough draft, then I could always change my mind. But now I'm absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely drained. Now there are holidays, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me. I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my evening was also my evening.
"Then I was free. And the stress at work was equal in those moments. Now, the family celebration is too much stress for me."
And then there are these rigid structures that make me even more nervous. Generally, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the ref is running well, considering the feedback and so on. But I'm completely drained and I'm wondering how much stress my body can take before it completely shuts down - if it doesn't do that already.
I ask myself if I really want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take some free time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, it was appropriately paid and we worked together as a team and not as individual fighters like it is now most of the time. But then I ask myself, if I would then be in the same place after a year and still be unhappy. You see, it's all a bit confusing, but maybe you have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, which I'm completely finished with and start crying over the smallest thought.
I won't make any decisions right now while I'm feeling emotional, that's probably not going to lead to anything good. But maybe your opinions can help me see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or at least enjoy Christmas, which is enough for now. Thank you for reading, and I apologize for the melancholic tone of my message.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a vacuum tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix vacuum tube preamplifier. This is based on real analog circuits because these can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a vacuum tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sputter.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can correct and exaggerate historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor-Technology. Since then, it has been continuously improved to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series from VOX offers a range of options from the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, providing guitarists with a wide variety of sound options. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and quick response. During an incoming analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the end stage determines the character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor Technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of a VT+- amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 vacuum tube, perfectly captures the subtle nuances and sound character of a vacuum tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues. The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main subject is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable clamping parts, it adjusts completely to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras. Of course, what finally fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses. A possible equipment setup would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash attachment.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 allow for more room for additional lenses. In addition, you can still store a lot of accessories. And those who have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series) can use their backpack for their camera gear and other things.
Both drone pilots and everyday backpack users find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice because it provides ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro, remote control, and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: possibly the longest in history In the past three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage. Is an end in sight?
The volcanic eruption on La Palma has been ongoing for 85 days now, making it the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island. Previously, the eruption of Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted 84 days, was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data available about earlier eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists are still hesitant to make a prediction on when it will end. The indicators suggest a slowdown, and the best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, speaking to the state TV channel RTVE.
Damage in millions In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated at more than 900 million Euros. Two new landmasses were formed along the coast through cooled lava with a total area of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana plantations, which are of immense importance to the island and support about 85,000 of its approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly, were severely affected. About 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily impacted, according to the newspaper "El País."
Christmas and gifts Christmas is just around the corner and children especially can hardly wait for the heavenly feast. The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension something seductive about it.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together. Therefore, it is all the more important to be conscious of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, was a peace-making "social contract of savage peoples," can break out of rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition. Like Saint Nicholas became the Christ Child.
Strictly taken were the Protestants, through whom the Christmas days were closely linked with giving gifts. Previously, gifts were given on St. Nicholas's Day in various ways. The background of this popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have thrown gold coins into the windows of three women in a night, in order to save them from a life of sin.
The practice of filling children's shoes with gifts, which is popular in Germany, originated from an unconventional way of giving. Protestants opposed this practice because they considered it a form of "saint worship" as they acted as intermediaries between God and people. As a result, they refused to support the institution.
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christkind and established a new tradition. As a result, the focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve. Although most Protestants no longer view such details as closely, it still bothers a few that the tradition of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martinmas celebrations and Martin parades, remains a firmly established part of the Christmas season.
Today, one can find everything from socks to luxury watches under the Christmas tree and by the door that the heart desires. Various traditions in Christian countries document a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian countries, there is a joyful hustle and bustle over the question of who brings the gifts to the children. In Germany, it depends on the region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a type of Nikolaus, appears with some unique characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the stricter Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer, and the preference for the hearth to gain access to houses during the winter festival. In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure during Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who gained some fame. Here it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh as a troika. In the Czech Republic, the land of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering gifts.
"I have been receiving this error message for three weeks now when trying to download a new book: 'My account data and contact data are currently up-to-date.' Please help me fix this issue, as otherwise I will have to buy another e-book #PRS_ORG#."
I searched for a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning. I was told that one would be sent to me. Since I haven't received it yet (not even in the SPAM folder), I would like to inquire how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace In London, on Saturday, a armed man was shot by the police. The police stated that callers had reported a man with a weapon who had entered a bank and the accountant's office.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers. There were shots fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police were not acting from a terrorist background. There are several embassies located in the area around Kensington Palace. The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Additionally, members of the royal family reside there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I would immediately be redirected to your side.
The decorative light fits harmoniously in every flower bed, garden area or rock garden. The light is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two earth spikes. Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum light duration of 10 hours - The robust plastic production is suitable for year-round use in outdoor areas. In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with color.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is completely harmless: The only thing that makes it shine is the sun, which makes these solar lights shine brilliantly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The smooth, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Just like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself at daytime. Its organic curves fit perfectly into any natural environment - whether on the terrace edge, in the lawn or in the flower bed.
He also makes himself known in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he knows he can assert himself thanks to his size. By making large preparations, you can save yourself: As a solar light, Smart Stone does not require any wiring or batteries. Simply place the Leuchtstein on any sunlit spot.
Two provided anchors ensure a firm hold when needed. The robust and weatherproof white plastic shell itself is durable. Its solar module houses a discreet "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The Smart Stone charges automatically when sunlight hits the case. When the sun sets, Smart Stone starts to light up on its own in one of six attractive colors that you can choose. You can also turn it off automatically when the battery level reaches a certain minimum or when it gets too bright.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew on the next day.
I have done it multiple times, but it didn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to order more from you, but if the coupon is not credited, then I won't order anymore. If you think differently, please let me know. Otherwise, today was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard. Since there was no hardware store open during the lockdown.
The motor control of LokSound 5 has been further improved. A variable PWM-takt frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures silent operation, even with Glockenankermotoren - the typical "humming" sound is a thing of the past.

Hello ladies, I hope I'm doing everything right here, is it really my first post after a year on Reddit?
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pains during my period and terrible PMS before my period. Now I would like to continue taking it, because due to chronic illnesses, I already have to take so many medications that I can't choose. My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had suddenly received 100 explosive-like pricks all over my body during my last approximately two-year break. Although it was superficial, it really weighed me down and I didn't feel good. In the two years of my break, nothing had ever really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this time. My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without additives, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me. Unfortunately, the gynecologist didn't take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still coming up.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, the skin is such a thing. I had severe neurodermatitis before puberty, then a period of rest, then widespread warts and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the context of a Christian illness and have become dependent on a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else has worked properly. It can also be good that hormonally it's just a worm in there, but when you're like me and everywhere is a construction site, you'd rather not look for anything else that's messed up.
I had already written everything for my colleague's seminar or whatever, and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request. I have to work in between and call the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it? Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
However, he is generally available in large quantities since he is available in black in large quantities.

In the name of the people: laypeople pass judgments while sitting in the courtroom in everyday clothing on the judge's bench. However, their judgment is crucial, even though they do not wear robes: jurors decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone is sentenced to prison.
Two of them are reporting in conversation with the "Public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have the ability to keep it for that long. We would use the table as if it were ours, just like they offered it.
I would be happy to help you translate the text from German to English. However, I need the text to be able to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide the text you would like me to translate?
Does the wardrobe have to be completely disassembled for pickup and replacement, and when would the pickup be?
The 110-kV power cable will be built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally valid. The decision of the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction, which will begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk is now sharing this seven-kilometer long cable. The cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt power line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead power line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only partially arrived at our location. The blue order number:#PRS_ORG# with the shipping number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so a delivery is now possible. Can you tell me what the next step is? Here's to a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I had already explained it several times yesterday!! This is a glass cabinet and all the sides are shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken. The cabinet is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to the #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the furniture cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR? The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request is at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues, I have been in the Ref since summer and I enjoy teaching, but I currently have big problems planning time-efficient lessons in the subject of Geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technologically, so I can only use the table, textbook, and OHP as mediums. In school, I can only copy software for free (which annoys me for geography). I currently need a lot of time to plan my classes.
We are currently working on the topic of Geofactors, and for me, every hour is crucial. In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching sessions (which I also need for UBs, etc.). I approach planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with the most tasks in the book, I am rather unhappy. That's why I also have worksheets. Maybe I can work with a geography teacher who can work efficiently with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#. I actually decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business. Only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed to enter most shops. The trade considers this unnecessary and complains about sales declines.
A possible solution he also has prepared. From the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE), the 2G regulations are damaging to the individual trade for the important Christmas business. In stores with non-daily need articles, there are sales declines to be complained about, criticized HDE-CEO Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively. Many had already written off their Christmas business. "What should have been the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost about a third of their pre-crisis funds in the past week. Things are going well only in the food retail and online sectors. The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director. "2G shopping doesn't help us fight the pandemic," he emphasized. The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel effort.
The person advocated for a nationwide acceptance of the Bändchen rule. After that, each customer should only be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all stores on that day with the obtained Bändchen. In addition, it was suggested that in the single trade, as already in the public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), random sample checks should be sufficient.
According to Wilhelm Wellner, CEO of Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specializing in shopping centers, the Christmas business was challenging. The frequency was recently at 75% of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the sales were at around 90% of the pre-Corona level. These figures will certainly fall in the middle of the important Christmas business, said Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers. This includes the so-called bandage solution, where "visitors, for example, can provide their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with an armband similar to that in a club hotel, they can enter all shops without interruption." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#. The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame that was tried to be covered up with yellow putty. It looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it and sealed it back into the package. Now, what do I need to do for the return?
The lamp is designed for dual balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction. A modern microprocessor takes care of setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp. In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K. Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The light produces a very strong light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent. By the way, it is also suitable for reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature. It is a great tool to work both on the film set and in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin. Additionally, there is a slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery).
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature. To store the settings of the individual settings on the memory slots, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons for a longer period. The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - Very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality because it allows for operation with favorable NP-F batteries. These are often already in possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment. The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have enough power before the set - there is a built-in battery tester for each of the two battery compartments, with a value displayed in both display windows (the left upper display for the upper battery compartment and the right lower display for the lower battery compartment).
Additionally, it is of course possible to continuously supply the projector with power through the supplied network component. The construction of the projector is very simple. They have a 16mm housing for attachment, so you can directly connect it to your camera.
The inclination can be reliably determined by measuring on both sides. It was ensured that the mechanical components were of extremely high quality and therefore designed for durability and harsh use. Additionally, a Neigegelenk is included in the delivery range.
It is great that there is also a bag included in the delivery. This means that you can transport or store the lights and any additional accessories you may want to buy without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received a gift that was too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a successful comeback against Leverkusen. After 22 minutes, the Hessians, who had lost their last two games in a row, seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga crisis.
But then the SGE turned on, shot itself within a good hour with frustration over a weak start to the season, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's insane what the boys did today," trainer Oliver Glasner jubilated on DAZN and praised each individual who was there with a "general applause". At first, it looked like another dampener for the now ninth-placed Frankfurt, who were still behind their expectations, with Patrik Schick leading Leverkusen 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer. "How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," said Glasner further. I am absolutely crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Also defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates. "I believe our mental strength is incredible," said the 27-year-old and was particularly happy with the result for the spectators. That was the party we wanted to celebrate today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glassner now wants to focus on himself, as he feels well prepared in terms of the personnel situation. It is remarkable that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition. It is top-notch work in our medical department, but also the players live professionally.
Now we want to "go step by step and remain modest" and complete the tasks at this level by the end of the year. As the next step, there is already a foreign game scheduled for Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (18.30, Sky).
I am getting an email that my package, due to an error on my part, is being returned to you. I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect the call, but there was no chance. Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is canceled?
If that were the case, then unfortunately it would mean that I wouldn't order again because it has already taken too long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chair?
The German women's handball team slipped onto the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after their defeat against Denmark in the group stage of the World Cup. At the end of the group stage, the DHB selection suffered a crushing loss to Spain 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and now has to face the host nation in the quarterfinals.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener. We need to act differently against Spain. After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danish (10:0).
"It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game we had to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk. In the fight for the quarterfinals, we need a clear improvement on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive, facing the second-place finisher from the 2019 World Cup.
The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was midfielder Alina Grijseels with six goals. "We were just not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look forward now." From front to back, not at the right height.
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at its best from the start. Misses and technical errors in attack, and gaps in defense, were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes. Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on form and prevented things from getting worse with some saves.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels successfully executed a quick counterattack. However, this was not the expected initial spark. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women had difficulty getting into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The match was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially because the defender Mia Zschocke got a red card shortly after due to a hard foul on her opponent. However, she will be able to participate again in the quarterfinals. Only in the last phase of the first half did the DHB team improve and at least manage to get within five goals of their opponents before the break.
The faint hope of a comeback after the switch was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19. Once again, the Greens were to blame in all areas and made it easy for the well-positioned opponent, who was a medal contender in the final round, to do so. As a result, the German team could not muster a performance improvement and went down as a clear loser from the podium.
DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions During Christmas Time As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have learned about Nikolaustag and use it as an opportunity to focus on family traditions during the Christmas season, including Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day. How was it at your home back then?
How about your partner? Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is the best thing for children?
The stepchild's shoe? Cookie baking? Decorating trees?
Would you like to play music? Is it Santa Claus, the Christmas Child, or is the gift actually from Grandma and Grandpa? Regardless, everyone puts in effort around Christmas to make it as beautiful as possible as a family.
Whether there are firm traditions or something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Could you please provide me with a transaction number or anything else that could help with the confirmation of the transfer?
I would like to give out gift voucher codes in the same way as #PRS_ORG# does.
The title is that I am an impunity doctor working in mobile impunity teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered, mainly in nursing homes. Since these are almost finished, it goes on to impunity centers for me further. I like to answer questions without a time limit on the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, does it conflict with the impunity?").
In my area of responsibility falls the clarification for vaccination, the indication determination (the person has a claim to a vaccination according to the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons that speak against it), the medical documentation and, if necessary, the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me). The vaccination itself is delegatable to qualified personnel, for example, medical technical assistants. In vaccination teams, we often have no one there, but rather (fortunately no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who, however, cannot perform vaccinations (can they?), so that I have to perform most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Butcher"-Question: What is a "Butcher" in Amberg? This dialect word, sent from Amberg, has caused hefty reflection in the BR-TV program "Wir in Bayern".
However, unlike many preceding days, the concept remained unrecognized by the callers this time. No, there was no "nervous person" or "someone who has to go fast".
The people heard from the TV moderator that it was completely false. What the man from Amberg announced and probably also caused astonishment among many people in Upper Palatinate. "The butcher", the viewers learned, "is a piece of paper with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bayerischen Fernsehen for years as an expert, confirmed this. With the note that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, somehow derived from the better-known Mundart word "Houdern". This closed the education gap - probably also for many who have been living in the Amberg region for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for two weeks. After confirmation, I always get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later. I have restarted the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected it to the PC, synchronized it, and repaired it.
"Nothing helped."
Tire selection for racing bikes - really that secure? I woke up full of action this morning because I wanted to do some training for my bike tour next week, at least a little. Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then happened what always waits in every city (this time: thank you Krefeld!) Glass shards on the track. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to go any further on the rest of the track.
Since I didn't have the opportunity to get a replacement jacket and hose on account of the day of the week, I had to turn back with a bad mood and take the first road home. It wasn't that bad weather-wise, maybe it's even better if I practice with the tire change before the bike tour. Now I'm facing a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I had to cover a long distance over several days, I didn't want to encounter this problem often. Now it wasn't too bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who picked up the bike for me at 14:00 and had traveled 120 km on them!) and he considered them suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years. If I think about it, I need to change the tire after 80-90 km, then I'm really not in a good mood :D
I recently spoke with an older man at the train station who asked me why I wasn't using Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unbreakable. Now it all sounds so tempting. But are they really that unbreakable?
I don't feel like spending 40 euros on tires now, only to be disappointed. Furthermore, I wonder: I believe I have 25x622 in my mind right now. There are indeed such tires (apparently?) for marathon plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you recommend a different tire for a racing bike to me? The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you again in advance for your help and loving greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver critically injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason when he crashed into a middle island and then onto the opposite lane, as the police reported.

Hello everyone, we are finally able to announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year! Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio, which has increased our planning efforts and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be present at the switch, so that we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you following us! > We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still pandemic – nonetheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible to follow.
The party will start around 0:30. Make sure to have cold drinks ready, plan for good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
