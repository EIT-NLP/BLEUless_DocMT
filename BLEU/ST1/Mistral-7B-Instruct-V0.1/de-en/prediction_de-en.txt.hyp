The item cost less than 20 Euros.
The fee is 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a large customer and therefore it is no problem for me.
You just need a number or instruction on how I should label the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I must say, I find that very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it for a better price, or is there another option for a refund?
I also fundamentally believe that it should not be expected of children to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings.
However, I find that it is also good for big people to take care of the little ones in moderation.
"Look briefly, help briefly, bring the bottle etc."
They learn responsibility, help in the family and are integrated.
As long as they are still young enough to be children, I see no problem.
If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's okay for him, then that's good.
You are the best judge to determine if it is suitable for your children.
It's not the case that he should knit K2 and accompany him for hours while falling asleep.
It is legally questionable.
Perhaps the psychologist's statement also comes from there.
If something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
If now there is a risk that you want to take, it is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of the book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can still recall almost the entire plot, but for some reason, I can't seem to remember the title. Maybe someone here knows it.
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of history, an animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his feral cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, comes to the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxious patients.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear of fire and ends up at this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, and to post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist is a kind of underground therapy group where patients have a chip planted in their heads that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and patients ultimately confront their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window, another drives intentionally to her death)
This is referred to as "the fight" in the book due to fear.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital where there was a fire.
This is so the rough handling, I am quite sure that the book in the original was written by a French author / authorine.
If someone knows about this action or even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
I have to contact my husband first.
That could take a while.
What steps do I need to take next?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
The translation of the given text from German to English is:  "Nice, 4 years old, Splitter under the thumbnail."
Kind, vier Jahre, hat über die gesamte Länge Holzsplitter unter dem Daumennagel (Außenseite).  Translation:  Child, four years old, has a piece of wood splinter under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to pull him with a pair of tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
"It didn't work out and I felt sad."
Now the child is reacting hysterically when we try it.
There's no chance left.
Tomorrow we are going to the doctor.

Due to Omicron: Johnson will accelerate booster vaccinations.
New Omikron cases are causing concern for politics and science in Great Britain.
Therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an immunization offer by New Year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will accelerate the booster vaccine rollout faster than previously planned in light of rapidly rising Omikron case numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening.
The deadline was previously at the end of January.
The British government would provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns are accelerated in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
Johnson said that in light of the Omicron variant, there is an urgent need to strengthen the vaccination protection.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third vaccine dose.
"Let's get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, increasing the total number to 3137.
In comparison to yesterday, there was an increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am for everyone to introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to a conversation via email.
I will respond to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but rather a more complicated name.
I searched him/her up on Google and based on where they come from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how I should write this email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want any officer to step on my feet.
Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
"Four of them go."
"Only one thing that I bought today is not going."
It seems that the chair had an invisible defect in sales.
How can such a damage to upholstery occur after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG#.
This has been working since approximately.
The translation for "14 Tagen nicht mehr." from German to English is "No more for 14 days."
Therefore, I have always bought the last books online and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there was none left.
"Now they are available again, and I would like to add two chairs to the order and have it charged to me."
The feeling when I cannot help.
Content Warning: I will write in detail about domestic violence here.
I simply have to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence frequently due to professional reasons.
A theme that bothers me a lot and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or we think we cannot help them.
It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
However, there are fewer things in my profession that excite me more than when I am unable to do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
However, even in conversation with four eyes, I cannot reach the perpetrator who is out of sight and hearing range.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
I always want to make it clear to everyone, even if it's very close to my tears, that all of it is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It becomes easier that way, but never.
Please, always remember that it is valuable to live without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"?

Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick there was abandonment.
"Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim have lost it - and how!"
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick said with a reflection on the cup loss in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have something anger in the stomach."
She didn't lie down after the game - but instead raised herself again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.
While the result itself was disappointing, the way it was presented was even more so.
A statistic can be called to represent the entire dilemma: The three-quote was only 13%, with 4 hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - are there any more questions?
John Patrick's response was: "After the victory at Tenerife, we were not concentrated enough and did not manage to implement what we had trained."
Specifically to move the ball.
Sebastian Gleim's opponent reacted differently: "Winning the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg is a great game," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
On Saturday at the Hohenlohe-Arena, there were only 750 visitors allowed, but they covered their costs.
Lastly, also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game.
"The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim.
During Patrick's team, players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to perform on the entire line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and come within eight points, after they had already fallen behind 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, there was also Justin Simon who scored twelve points.
"Luckily, there is a lot of time left for Hadern."
The Riesen received the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (8 pm), with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg beforehand.
We had an earlier email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have registered myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have written to them for this reason.
We had already registered a year ago.
Max Raabe turns 59 just like he was chiseled from an egg.
He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on his way with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he can show up.
Max Raabe had originally wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on this Sunday.
"But nothing comes out of it."
The concert that was planned has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order", to prevent the spread of the Corona virus.
Other planned performances of his during the Advent season have had to be postponed, as stated on the website of the singer, who is turning 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
The artists want to catch up on their previously postponed dates from January due to the pandemic.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, and has been singing with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin he studied opera singing, in 1986 he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his classmates.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of swing tunes and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place on the charts.
He managed to bring it from the niche to the mainstream.
Dressed elegantly, with blonde hair tightly combed and labeled, Max Raabe is a well-known figure in the current German-speaking music scene.
The program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to receive a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be added to existing furniture and so we could check beforehand if it matches color-wise.
It's still not working. I can only see the cover but not turn the pages.
Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Minister for Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing companies, as has been proposed in a popular vote in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a new housing unit, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to ensure that tenants have security so that their rent is payable in the next years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing companies is actually the best protection against monopoly formation.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party will set up an expert committee to determine how to handle the result of the referendum.
If the situation did not calm down, Geywitz held talks with the FDP in the coalition government over further strengthening of tenancy law.
The coalition agreement includes a rent brake until 2029, a limitation on rent increases in tight housing markets, and an expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I realized after a few days that I forgot the last step in payment.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or if it will come again?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
The word "Gutschein" translates to "coupon" in English. So, the sentence "Gutschein klingt super" translates to "Coupons sound great" in English.
Then I will solve it independently when placing the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself with my finger.
This is an absolute audacity.
At least 100 deaths due to tornados in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, many tornados have been drawn through the USA.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be mourned.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On Friday night in the United States, several tornados caused severe damage and may have resulted in up to 100 deaths.
The storms left a roughly 320 kilometer long trail of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear of that state said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had passed through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial equipment, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is possible.
He counts alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers are increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# has been sold out.
That's too bad.
Is it still being produced?
Or is she completely removed from the selection?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When would you like to sign up?
If the delivery cannot take place in my home, I must cancel the order!
I understand, can I place the order for the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had submitted the contact form or given a return and wanted to inquire if it arrived or was processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination incentives and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government in Germany continues to reject proposals for an immunization bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and are offering their employees financial incentives for getting vaccinated.
With this, they are on the same line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans to call for vaccinations - in the German model - is intended to increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He has switched to a company that he had criticized.
His situation is not better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and was looking for something else.
You are also allowed to do that.
And if he didn't like you back then: no big deal.
He found his job not good either.
There are too many variables.
Please stop the cancellation.
That will then be quite relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with the first own campaign
Hello Boron!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure over the Griffon's Pass and want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is made, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are thought out and now I am starting to write the introductory adventure and I am already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-See.
There, the further development of the action should take place.
Some miles away from the village, a group of Goblins should ambush the hero and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player character the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways: by convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed
When the hero is not noticed, the goblins lurk in a hollow path and flank him with three bows on both sides, while two of them stop the carriage with spears.
If there were to be a fight and the heroes were to lose, I would have two solutions.
The heroes will all be found unconscious and then healed by the son of the village schoolteacher, a half-elf.
The cart is naturally gone.
If a defeat was inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants suddenly appeared and came to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you hold Deus ex Machina in Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much of a starting point for an adventure?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely cherish many of your ideas and now I have more trust in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And again stuck together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Despite this, I would still like to send them back.
Can you let me have the receipts so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

I am tired of Sky Sport F1
Hello fellow F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I just wanted to take a breath with this post.
For the first time today, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 warm-up on time.
Despite the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the plan, the plan was still far behind schedule. However, we could have still shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) if we had started on time.
It seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE here probably had no choice.
Despite being stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcasted the end of the race.
Despite the small praise: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a rule violation by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that one could change tires under a red flag.
Although there had been this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen could change his tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew there was a possibility of deviation.
I believe such fundamental rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a Pay-TV channel.
It is not the first time to solve puzzles, what is now allowed or prescribed by rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, I don't like the style of Roos' commentary, but I give that it's a matter of taste.
"But seriously, I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL better."
There are constant absurdities that make both of them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one brings a lot of chaos to the comments, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Lastly, advertising takes over at Sky, as can be heard in the final round, where Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV where only the German audio track without commentary comes directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel.
Although we must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very poor and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they can still broadcast, excluding advertising.
At least the grandiose F1 season makes a lot less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion once.
"To here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, Messing und mehrfarbiges Glas x 1"
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week but it hasn't been delivered yet.
I have contacted the chat twice and so far have not received any response.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12, 19.
One of them showed a defect after a relatively short time (the material had a hole on the front of the stool).
I am requesting support.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can compare the services.
The pumps are strong enough to operate entire systems.
If one has a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are used so that multiple outlets can be attached.
The MK-series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fans and pumps are also available to add an accent to the aquarium, such as a hood (find them in our shop) or a decor that converts air bubbles into a function.
Here one could name a treasure chest, a shell or something similar.
The MK-series has a unique, soundproof construction and therefore produces low operating noises.
The installation is very simple.
The blower pump is connected to an outlet via a 4/6 mm air hose...and it's ready to go.
The blower pump should be at the same or higher level as the water surface and placed outside.
One should place a return valve between the deeper position of the blower pump and the desired water level.
To translate the text "Den Luftschlauch einfach durchschneiden und das Ventil dazwischen setzen." from German to English, it means "Easily cut the hose and place the ventilator in between."
This would prevent it from happening if water were to flow backwards, which runs water from the basin through the pump...
If the exhaust fan were placed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK-series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days on eBay, the packages are packed daily and picked up daily here.
Everything is running smoothly, it's going very fast.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one gets upset because something took a little longer than expected.
It's like not everyone understands all the employees who work in logistics...of course, here Corona doesn't hold.
Please do not evaluate negatively just because the delivery is delayed, it is solely due to the courier services.
People often complain about these services, even though we say at the moment that... they have it pretty tough.
This is also very different regionally.
Be kind to no one, stay healthy and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order yellow with and without armrests?

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, sends his daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly trained astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
With applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the founder of Amazon.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds underway and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), for whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests at the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the flight.
He had to work hard and do everything himself during his assignments.
She just flew along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator said, "He would love to return to space again."
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies mostly autonomously.
During the flight of the rocket, the capsule was separated and reached a height of approximately 100 kilometers above the earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth's surface as the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation.
This was the third crewed flight from Blue Origin: The first in July had Amazon founder Bezos on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, known for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was present, along with former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Audrey Powers, the deputy chief of Blue Origin.
Critics are accusing Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism with little scientific research interest for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Do you just need the tracking number for my mail?
Someone who works or studies in biochemistry.
I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite exciting, even in the lab I don't get bothered (I have already completed the practicals for inorganic chemistry).
I had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would study until my promotion and determine my career path.
Currently, I have doubts, particularly about my career prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc), one often hears about great career opportunities, and on the other side, one often hears about unemployed biologists and unbelievably poorly paid jobs.
From there, I would really be interested in painting:
1) What are you working on currently?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What kind of training did you complete?
4) Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently uncertain and considering whether to drop out of my studies in 2022 and pursue a career as a Fachinformatikerin.
If you have experiences, write them down too :)
"Extra Stress before Holidays and Weekend Celebrations"
This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax.
Therefore, make a post now.
Not only during big holidays, like Christmas break, do we experience stress in the workplace.
It seems like there are also holidays plus bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was Mari's Ascension, which is called "Aufahrt" in Switzerland.
On Fridays, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
There were numerous emails that had to be sent out before departure, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend.
Weil... ja weil? translates to "Because... yes, because?" in English.
"Isn't it strange that 'next week then' sounds so far away and can't be true?"
Or because people want to accomplish as much in a short week as they would in a normal one?
I was not only stressed on Wednesday, but also extremely exhausted.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress came unexpectedly, the colleagues were all quite independent.
My question is simply: Are we the only Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical faith?
Do you know that in the North too?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thüringen.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her hometown in Thuringia - but she still has no gifts.
"The beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then one simply drives to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She would adjust to the festival by baking and singing with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
Until the thoughtful days she still had some things to do: "For the first time, I still have no gifts, I finally have to let go."
Nekton-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regeneration.
Nekton-Bio contains all the essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg biotin per kg.
Nekton-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather damages in bird-keeping are solely due to feeding errors.
Since feathers are made of protein-rich substance, it is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat that the bird has a rich and balanced protein diet.
For a functioning metabolism, daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly considered and balanced.
During the use of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
Nekton-Bio is soluble in cold water and can be easily mixed into drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it is still not functioning.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now?
I cannot make the bed.
The middle section is being held by two feet, unfortunately they are produced with errors.
The middle section does not fit into the planned holding device.
I will also receive new ones.
When will they finally be sent off?
"No flat surfaces."
According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct parts, they were just too narrow.
"But that doesn't matter."
The main thing is to fulfill their purpose.
The translation for "Bei mir sind sie nicht flach" from German to English is "They are not flat with me."
Could I receive this?
Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem again?
House fire with two lightly injured people and high damage
Two people have been lightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Additionally, a damage in the range of six-digit Euros has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had likely spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech) in Germany.
According to the reports, two residents were brought to the hospital on Sunday with mild poisoning from smoke inhalation.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out a deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
"Then it comes much later."
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin posted a photo of his first vaccine on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Uğur Şahin, the CEO of Biontech, has not publicly disclosed his vaccination status.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
The illness of a friend made him move, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a coronavirus vaccine.
There were false information on social media that I was not vaccinated.
"In reality, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"My friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated for several months now, in order to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a call from last week had changed his opinion: "I was deeply disappointed when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The classmate and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further.
He did not ask for reasons.
"It seems that the most common cause is fear, which is often fueled by incorrect information and mistrust."
It is difficult to fight fear with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin states that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as clearly stated by Deutsche Welle itself.
"At that time, it was not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin.
In Germany, there is a prioritization for vaccination.
Now the prioritization has been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has stated that he has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer station: thousands of people without power
In several towns in North Rhine-Westphalia, the power went out on Friday evening: no electricity anymore and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a transformer station.
After a fire with heavy damages in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-District in North Rhine-Westphalia had to be without power for approximately 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in several towns had their lights go out due to a fire.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency power generators were in operation until the large-scale outage was finally completely restored in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered care positions in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and thanked the helpers for their effort.
We are very aware that the past 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Division, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages would take several days, explained he, because the Westnetz-monteurs could only provisionally restart some cables at first, he said.
According to the company, a technical defect caused the fire.
The current flows again.
According to Westnetz, the fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 pm in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear.
There are extensive cleaning and repair works needed over there.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
By Saturday evening, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had power again.
Additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid will be gradually connected from 21.30 Uhr.
Since 11:15 PM, the last people affected by the outage also had power.
Over 80 monitors from Westnetz and partner companies were involved.
The authorities called for neighborhood assistance on Saturday afternoon in addition to setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings.
"It is now important for citizens to take care of their elderly or single neighbors and inform the local fire department if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus during the installation and operation of emergency power generators was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
Additionally, temporary care places were set up in schools according to official statements for those people who could not provide for themselves or who needed medically dependent equipment or were dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros?
The topic is the daily cover #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also had a beautiful day and please stay healthy ❤️
I can't mount the underside on the tabletop.
This refers to Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations of it.
We wanted tables with a diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, however, I cannot combine it and therefore shorten it.
Can you help me further there?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be happy to receive feedback.
Yes, that's really simpler!
Then we'll do it that way!
Could you please send me the return receipt via email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before making the purchase, I had not restarted the E-PRS_ORG#.
Should I do that now?
I find such a low invoice almost unexpected.
With that, we are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination: Combined Jumper Wins
The German Nordic combined skiers Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have podiumed at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give up again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already taken a large lead after the ski jumping and was now leading in the luge.
Return of Contract Number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both created a new one and are using version 4.5...
It is possible that she has heard about problems more often.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too.
When I try to open it, the message comes up: "Oops!"
This document could not be opened.
"The file may be incorrect. Please report it to the customer service."
As far as I can tell, it is an epub file with #PRS_ORG#.
Can you help me further?
"Chat connection is gone now?"
I have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the building materials with some soapy water to remove dirt, grease, and fingerprints, then rinse with clear water and let them dry.
Before you use a new color on your model for the first time, it is recommended to practice with 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do that on the unseen inner side of the parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the construction site
Stroke the brush evenly line by line.
Light overlapping of color layers results in an even surface later.
Avoid quick back-and-forth wiping with a brush.
Through this, unrealistically appearing surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could later become visible.
Metallic tones and metallic colors come with a separate brush at the end.
If they are mixed with normal colors, it can result in unpleasant metal stripes.
"Let the painted parts dry for a day before you sandblast them."
The models achieve their original appearance by using decals or removable images.
From emblems on airplanes to ship names and decorative elements on automobiles: Decals give the model its final shape.
"Arrange the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible."
A cockpit of an airplane can be easily covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
"More important than the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers and pliers, are patience, time and a steady hand when adhering."
Cut each needed decal individually and place them for you.
Decals are also known as water transfer images because you can wet the back of them with water until the carrier paper becomes dark from the moisture.
Then you gently slide the image a little off the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you had previously dampened).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
"Caution: Always check if the image is correctly positioned before completely peeling it off the paper, otherwise it may stick to your finger, knit or even tear."
To translate the text "Überschüssiges Wasser mit einem Haushaltstuch absaugen" from German to English, it means "To absorb excess water with a household sponge".
"Caution not suitable for children under 3 years old"
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and find my place again until I know where I left off.
On Saturday, I had already communicated with you before.
Can I receive this via email?
Would you like all three packages as well?
"Because the lamp arrived in three individual packages at my place"
Thank you very much despite everything!
Then I would buy something elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
"Would I be able to return it problem-free?"
Child Wish Treatment at PKV / What is an "Insurance Case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in children's wish treatment for some time, but now that it's about billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands in the way.
Translate the following text from German to English.  Der Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe nach:  The Reihe
We had requested the children's wish procedure from the PKV in advance and received approval for 3 attempts.
The attempts were in no way restricted (for example, in terms of time frame or success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was reimbursed by the health insurance.
Some time later we tried to have a second child, and we went through two (unsuccessful) attempts, but we didn't count them with the health insurance yet.
We again requested cost coverage from the PKV and were again granted three additional attempts.
After several additional attempts (we have conducted more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive ones should be reimbursed by the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3) the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The explanation: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first acceptance fall.
The second child wish be a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in this round:
Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 replacements will be refunded) or us (there are 5 replacements to be refunded)?
If the PKV had informed us that with a birth the further attempts would fail?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (caused by closed ovaries) cannot be cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts could give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variations via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
"In Order."
We will not order anything from them again.
If you add up my sales and those of my friend #NAME# (same address), it's clear you've lost good customers.
You are allowed to forward this to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been ordered and now you are telling me that I have to return the thing first.
I can't really understand why the furniture is completely disrupted when it arrives at my place.
Could you please take a look at what the colleague wrote in the screenshot?
It is clear and obvious that the repayment was ordered and I have not yet received a repayment through #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect appeared after several months.
A desk chair must withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they cannot sell him as an office chair.
The guarantee of 24 months is valid regardless of that.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transportation company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products are applied with additional chairs that we unfortunately cannot find at your place.
Can you help?
The theme of the week: The best low budget films.
A low-budget film does not have a specific definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia states:  "Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that is edited by volunteers. It contains information on a wide range of topics, including history, science, art, and culture. The content on Wikipedia is created through a collaborative process, with users adding, removing, and modifying information. The site is available in over 300 languages and has become one of the most popular sources of information on the internet. While Wikipedia is a valuable resource, it is important to note that the information on the site may not always be accurate or up-to-date. Users should always verify the information they find on Wikipedia with other reliable sources."
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture made with minimal financial resources from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what didn't you like about it at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completely furnished two homes with your furniture.
Odelle wanted to get the best price for the gray leather sofa.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings.
There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes, is no chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...then I will give up again, because it simply does not work here.
Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus comes with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in conflict with the Belarussian regime.
The costs would be very high and would mean significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation, said the researcher at the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This hovering state - Belarus is not entirely small about it, but the EU feels itself as a winner - is likely to continue for a while longer.
Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Human Rights Convention.
It seems that there is an increasing normalization of "pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole did not take a stance against it, it will come at the cost of fundamental rights.
This development weakened the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
"She cannot assert herself when a member state puts its thing into its head, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border protection agency, access to its border."
In addition to the price the EU pays for its policy on the border with Belarus, as Bossong says, there will be a further obstacle to the establishment of a fundamental agreement on asylum policy, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt to cross the border
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus.
"Fifty-five migrants were arrested and returned to the border during the night on Sunday, a spokeswoman for the authority announced on Sunday," in English.
The Polish officials were attacked by migrants with stones near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the report, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
The Border Guard registered 52 attempted border crossings in 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had crossed the border fence.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU is accusing Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have closed off sections of their borders.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
Additionally, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving there.
According to Bossong, the most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on the airlines.
"The EU has shown its market power and proven its determination to act with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures."
Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not used to the fact that the security apparatus regularly detains thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale.
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen broke two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest.
The silver arrows are suspected to have two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest is regarding an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety-Car phase, where he is accused of overtaking illegally.
A second protest was lodged against the valuation at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed in a rule-conforming manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Hamilton on the last lap in the Mercedes and was on his way to his first Formula-1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety-Car phase, during which the Dutch driver overtook the car in front of him.
I am testing that.
I am talking to the bank and will report back to you again.
Thank you for the support.
Free entry for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa Park, which gives its name to the Europa Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited SC Freiburg to Fantag.
According to the park, members and holders of season passes from the sports club in Baden-Baden, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa Park for free on this day.
Additionally, there were coupons for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters shone through their red and white stripes on this day.
"The park was perfect thanks to Füchsle, Ed, and many red and white helium balloons," said the park.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s.
The first SC Freiburg day at the Europa-Park has once again shown how well the partnership works.
"Seeing shining fans who are having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not like originally 1699€ ?

Judith Hermann reads from her novel "Home"
In the framework of the reading series "LiteraTour Nord," author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on a sold-out Friday at the Blue Note and also served as the moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the sea and listens sensitively to the night sounds at her door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I didn't receive any email confirmation or anything similar.
My question would be if my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for their delayed chat and cheap goods from China.
Your mistake is to fix it and not all from our household.
Please contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro gift card, a repeat order of the #PRS_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to be delivered to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me.
With friendly greetings.

Tannenverkauf in Schönwolde: In the town of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations while selling spruces.
Once, a man had to drive back home alone because he and his partner couldn't agree.
He plants about 2000 trees every year for that purpose.
During his 56 years, he has experienced many curious situations.
Christmas always makes things a little more fun, he says.
And what about the coupon?
"If not, I'm leaving as a customer?!"
Despite receiving a defective delivery, I have now paid the full price for it.
Then I would evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to discuss which one is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both of them have their names.
In English, a possible translation for "Dreher" could be "spinner". However, "spinner" doesn't sound as appealing as "Dreher" does in German.
"Problems with fiber optics and Devolo DLan/Magic"
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and sent 50 Mbit without any issues, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the LAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also come through.
However, the other DLan module, which sends WiFi, no longer receives the full 500, but the further I move away from the module in the house, the less comes in (so use a power socket that is one, two, three, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the first floor (~45 Mbit) than before.
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were similarly large losses here as well.
Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost when using glass fiber through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely expensive to install LAN cables in that house.
I'm really frustrated as to why I created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even happier to receive an answer.
When it's time to switch bank accounts.
"Who would have thought that now there would be peace on the Giro accounts, they see themselves deceived."
While many banks used the fall to confirm the past year's fee increases with various tricks on their customers, the negative interest rate deductions are also decreasing.
The Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 Euros.
She has just halved her allowance and even quadrupled it for the daily fee.
In the first step, the border was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 Euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 Euros for savings accounts.
"However, these lower rebates now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a spokesperson on request."
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly agreed individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already fallen below the 50,000 Euro limit, which still applies, as is the case with ING Germany.
The popular direct bank DKB has reduced its interest rates in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
"Well, over 100 banks have now received a deposit of 25,000 Euros or less, according to Verivox's internet portal."
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 Euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even won a court case against this regulation in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin.
Currently, there are discussions in the banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the upper instances were to declare negative interest rates generally invalid and millions of bank customers had to be refunded.

Jennifer Aniston has an entire army of beauty.
She is now officially the head of Hollywood.
However, your life is like a journey up and down the mountains.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was named the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter."
For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of much discipline and effort.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers is concerned with your appearance.
"Well, Aniston, treat yourself to a chip today (yes, that's right: a single chip from the jar)."
It's amazing that both male and female fans still flock to their hearts in equal measure.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck - and is still searching for the great love.
And the baby wish has been crossed off the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked have no idea what's going on with me medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
One can only hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Dishonorable end of a career: Raikkonen has to give up
Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his glove and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the tires, Raikkonen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before even completing half of the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport-Königsklasse.
His wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye.
Saikkonen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from the pole position 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Nolte wins the 60th World Cup in the Two-Man Bob - Sports
The target of the Bob pilot is the mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen, with 94 successes.
"I had calculated that I needed to earn 19.5 wins per season to make it to Cortina 2026, and with two victories in two days at the Winterberg races, the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg is confident in his ability to achieve this goal."
He first defended against Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday, moving from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and gained a larger advantage on Sunday with 0.30 seconds.
With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis from SV Halle, Candy Bauer from BSC Oberbärenburg, and Alexander Schüller from SV Halle, he managed to defeat the British athlete Brad Hall.
The third place was won by Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was traveling to Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after finishing in second place previously.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished fourth in the first race and ended up in eighth place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner.
"Nolte with Home Win - Podium for Jamanka"
At her home track, Laura Nolte won her third season's victory in the women's two-man bobsleigh.
After finishing in fourth place in the Monobob on the previous day, she won the World Cup on Sunday with German teammate Deborah Levi in the three-person event.
Mariama Jamanka, the two-man bobsled Olympic champion from BRC Thüringen, finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She booked her first podium finish this winter, in addition to her Olympic qualification.
Kim Kalicki, a woman from Wiesbaden, landed in third place along with Leonie Fiebig.
It was super cool for me to get the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is taking me with her.
I am very happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing off, but there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed with the slightly error-prone trips, but she thought: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling already in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I didn't receive him and therefore couldn't pay him, so I finally had to ask.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it said that it had run out, which very angered me.
Look in the chat it was about the Asare chair.
I would like to return it and then reorder it since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipment starting on March 16th?
There was no information about such a long delivery time on your website.
No until I click on it, there will be an extra field with the message.
"I picked it up yesterday from my colleague."
Why is it a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
However, we still want the shelf module, exactly a new undamaged one.
And not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello lovely girls and women,
I have something that I just want to write and maybe it goes the same way for one or the other...
I am 24 years old, have PTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - except for the fact that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he is actually my child 1 to 1.
My friend (we've been friends for 6 years) is sick, he burned himself second degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with his shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burn).
He is currently feeling cold and we see each other less often (1-2 times a week), which makes it very difficult for me to fulfill my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the heating lamp and stroking him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is just away for a month.
"Now we have to do housework too, which we will of course divide up."
"But cooking for myself is a lot of work for me..."
My PTBS (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) illness is now well-adjusted, I am halfway through treatment and am getting better.
"Not good, but I'm getting better and almost symptom-free."
My university is demanding a lot from me right now. Tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test that I haven't studied for yet, and tomorrow afternoon I have an Anatomy class that I should at least prepare a little for.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is written in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
That's how my week goes: Just until tomorrow, then it's weekend.
"But then what happens after that?"
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of vacation.
The translation for "Nur noch bis Wochenende" from German to English is "Only until the weekend."
"Just until..."
And so it continues forever.
I believe, I am so stressed that I need these spiritual references, otherwise I'll go crazy.
"Somehow I feel guilty and chaotic, but I don't know how to do it differently..."
How are you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my captors otherwise.
I think there's also something to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today unfortunately, the entire thing is a different color, the surface is scratched, and the table leg has an impression.
During the first delivery, the color was exactly as it appeared on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th.
In addition, two times.
"However, it was not confirmed."
"That was completely different: I noticed at school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and for them it's just another subject like math or geography."
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps because I was Christianly raised and I always somehow believed.
How are you standing?
Perhaps you can tell me about your colleagues from work or school with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional life and it makes sense to separate them.
Yes, there is also a lesson plan, etc.
"But it was simply strange to find a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity."
What motivates someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture or something else?
I hope your question is not too private.
Is it not possible to change it or not? Please write in English, I understand it well.
This is already very long, then I would avoid it.
"That's good, thank you."
I expect a prompt response by the end of the next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
"Help with film search, please"
Hello everyone,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
The film has two time axes (or parallel worlds).
To one, the modern (real world).
"On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain)."
Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a story is created.
I think the antagonist is also a soldier from the land of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live himself.
I believe the transition is also the graveyard of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If you say something to me, I am thankful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
"Fast forward: still alive :D"
Relax.
A child holds out much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cushion creatures, they come and go more often, but no minute surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good night.
No kisses.
"We didn't have a duvet, we've always had a cover."
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Do you turn your head to the side?
Is it possible to lift something from the stomach?
Is the face directly on the mattress?
You can tell if everything is in order by looking at it.
We have also grown up, and when my husband came into the world, it was just like that, you put the kids on your belly to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased many articles.
But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback yet.
It's about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the dresser.
I would like to get in touch with you as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To make it completely clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held on to.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just simple that the politics of this broadcaster is now underwater.
Fast every format is sponsored (ok), but then immediately go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one was an "independent" Internet broadcaster.
"Arno quote: 'We don't want any running street lamps.'"
What is it now?
A 0815 advertiser who tries to bring his BilloMerch to elite fans.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The rules that apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
"Of course, they can continue to insult people."
A landlord who lacks empathy and, at the expense of action, tries to make ashes out of the rented rooms that have exploded.
How can one find everything well?
It's great when you like it, I find it terrible.
I would like a callback, as my delivered wooden table was defective upon delivery.

If you need comfort for an upset stomach or just want to cuddle - my little warm friend is very versatile.
Cherry pits are a traditional household remedy for regulating temperature, as cherry pits absorb and release heat efficiently.

Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
While Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
"Even under the third trainer, it's not working out in Ingolstadt."
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead?
Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) could not be charged through the power supply.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be functioning.
I thought that a power supply alone would be sufficient for operation.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the charger plugged in.
After that, I expanded the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is there something else that's broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to my room.
How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# stool.
We don't know how high the seat is....
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment?
"No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!"
A storage capacity of 20 liters can easily accommodate larger photo equipment, which can be securely folded using the padded FlexFold parts.
And whatever else you need for everyday objects remains well-organized and separable from photography equipment in a practically configurable interior space.
The "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2) presents the series in a new look.
The minimalist design of Peak Design's Everyday Backpack series has become famous for its innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while providing quick and easy access to photography equipment.
It works with two possibilities: conventionally through the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, or through an excellent solution that has already proven itself effective in Messenger Bags.
In the closure of the backpack, there is a metal locking mechanism with corresponding anchor bars on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "filling levels" by including 4 anchored straps that can be securely attached to the closure.
If the backpack is fully loaded, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
The clamp and hook are also magnetic.
So can the backpack also be reliably closed without hanging the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other, Fotorucksäcken: Besides the Deckelklappe, there is also a Reißverschlussöffnung on both sides of the Rucksack.
This eliminates the biggest advantage of traditional backpacks with a top access - you don't have to rummage through the content anymore!
Simultaneously, this clever detail increases the everyday practicality of the backpack enormously: If you not only bring your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In an everyday backpack, you can configure the interior individually (more details below) and easily separate the two while keeping them problem-free - and through the two side openings, you can access them independently of each other.
Additionally, you can pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while everyday items remain secure in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way.
Comfortable, adjustable car seats help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is completely made from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents remain dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for their support email.
#NAME# sent me an email confirmation for the assignment yesterday.
The pickup of the incorrectly delivered table has been announced by the expedition team.
I have not received any news yet.
I would like immediate processing.
I am now writing with the third support worker, and I haven't gotten any further than the promise that I will receive a confirmation email.
The text is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
Is it possible to determine when the wardrobe will be delivered again?
"There's no option for me to keep him like that."
"It works."
Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you another beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
The order and payment were on January 12, 21.
I received a completely different lamp than what I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back.
And that the past year unfolded differently than expected, I could not know and had not been able to settle it and clarify it in a timely manner.
"However, as a customer, I do not accept that kind of damage."
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are cast and then mechanically processed (machined and cut).
All the tested sheets are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain sheets and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created, which focuses on the growth of the sheet according to the properties of the original assembly.
The produced sheets in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness.
Additional openings increase the effectiveness of cooling the disc, as the slots improve the cleaning of the brake pads and rotors.
The aesthetic properties of our painted sheets highlight the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern tip of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everybody wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems like the other pioneers have the same idea!
You have to surpass your pioneer colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and create a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions or apply rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a three-year period from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
Afterward, their selection will be revealed, and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a base has the most engineers, it gets a fortress!
This deactivates half of the site - which reduces the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvermen.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The bidder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions accordingly.
This will continue until the buyer has moved five times, which means covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout, in which the players must defend Coloma against an attack by angry bandits.
If the players control enough cowboys and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lesser rewards or end up on the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Aren't Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
The use of psychological violence, sexual abuse, and misuse of power.
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately.
Michael Winterhoff, a child psychiatrist, is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a fierce debate on education.
Former patients and guardians are now raising serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the movie is hard to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people should never, never, never seek power over the child.
Our goal should always be to give the child space for their development and to create a framework as large as possible that makes sense and is feasible in the given situation.
"Shivers, I am still shaking."
Holetschek: Countries discuss the abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a federal way to abolish the test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We countries need quick clarity on when the testing requirement can be lifted for triple-vaccinated individuals," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, in an interview with "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sensible, but also provides an additional vaccination incentive," said Holetschek.
According to the article in afp, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has stated that he will present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the coming Tuesday.

How should I go there the best?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS_ORG# account.
Advertisement: Oh no, an error has occurred.
The purchase is made through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I have updated account data.
What could this be referring to?
What you describe as *Awareness* is referred to as sensory perceptions under full narcosis.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 to 1000.
In most cases, it comes to hearing noises/voices, less often to seeing images, and almost never to perceiving pain.
The relevant topic for this is Caesarean section, which is associated with a higher rate of awareness as we avoid using very deep anesthesia for the protection of the child until the umbilical cord is cut.
The previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
"Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex had none."
I read your comment wrong.
The chair is however defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ doesn't help us either.
These are legal entitlements to guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be for her to take back the defective stool.
This is not only a legal requirement but also a standard practice in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least returned the defective stool.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some money there.
I already sent you an email that you haven't replied to.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
The person told me that they would only deliver up to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
"Wouldn't I be called?"
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has passed away at the age of 97.
He has established a profile as a theater critic and as an Intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle, who was 97 years old, passed away on Friday.
The new book is still on the table, freshly printed: "An old man will grow older."
The trembling diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle conducted until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, comes the news that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book says: "I acknowledge my gratitude for life here once again."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common types are Europallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to the statistics of Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million Euros.
The number of pallets imported into Austria annually is not known.

Rouladen Tips and Tricks
I received many great tips here a week ago for the perfect goulash.
There was at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again :)
"Now I have gotten a taste for it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve."
Tomorrow I will start a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now?
What happened to the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I'll get there.
The topic is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was informed via email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
"However, the money is not in my account yet."
Could you please check there?
Where there is Christmas goose in space Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck is part of the Christmas holidays, along with the Christmas tree and gifts.
Have you taken care of any wings yet?
"Time is running out now."
We will reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas goose in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a guitar amplifier plays a significant role in determining the warmth and fatness of its sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor-Switching.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler you can set the desired level and at the same time the distortion of your sounds.
Additionally, the VT+ Series Amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL-Regler, which allows you to reduce the volume level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion.
Up above, it is already audible that with the POWER LEVEL-Regler, one can easily make a power reserve float when it suddenly gets loud.
Thank POWER LEVEL-Regler allows the entire potential of the VT+ series to be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
This signal is processed using a boxing simulation, so that you can get an "acoustic" impression when using a headphone or making direct recordings.
The AUX jack can be connected to a CD player or MP3 player, so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuning device.
Who spends extra on a VFS5 foot pedal can comfortably call up sounds with their foot, turn on/off effect blocks, and tap the tempo of compatible effects.
This is actually indispensable for live use.
VOX is taking another step into the future with its new power packages!
"That was seen differently by others."
Do you have the possibility to send the lamp back?
Is it hanging too low over the dining table?
I would also like to send them back then.
Can you help me further?
And the furniture?
Do we have another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a bequest or voucher as well.
Under certain circumstances, I can find a buyer for the furniture.
"Only over 1,000 Euros worth of goods that I don't need are still quite a bit."
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status at your company?
Iran sees progress in negotiations over nuclear deal.
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations over the revival of the international atomic energy agreement.
"Both sides are standing short of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, as reported by the Iranian news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building atomic weapons.
The talks in Vienna were continued on Thursday after a nearly one-week break, with the aim of reviving the agreement.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations.
There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony-Anhalt, which is now a federal state with the highest Corona incident rate.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence in the country.
The only state in Germany has a value above 1000.
Thüringen is the only state in Germany that had more than 1000 coronavirus cases on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had the highest incident rate nationwide, the value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incident in Thuringia was slightly decreased, but was still above 1000.
In Thüringen, 2242 new cases of infection with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals.
There can be delays in submitting during weekends.
Additionally, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery starts in early March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print and stick it on the package and give it to the post office, is that it?
Here do I not need to click/point/fill anything further?
I want to avoid exactly that, so I am writing to you.
I would like to please take care of the return shipment at my own expense.
In my opinion, a 8 euro return fee is audacity.
It's time for changes.
Hello members of the German Bundestag, I am StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post here for?
If one looks at the activity of the Bundestag in the past months, one can conclude: It does not exist.
We have entered a winter slumber and have extended the summer break for several months.
#Where is the problem?
Yes, what happened?
The main reason for this is probably dissatisfaction, as some things have happened here and we generally appear.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are still interested in the Bundestag election.
#What we need to change
"At this location, the community around the Bundestag is asked which one they want to keep alive."
The impulse came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found, in simple terms, a pile of debris.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would like to emphasize once again that everyone should participate, otherwise this project will not exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can enter the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I'm quite sure that I've forgotten something, but it's not that bad, we'll just use Discord at the end.
If you have desire and time, come to Discord, work together and let us decide the future democratically.
I have ordered a lamp shade for you that is yet to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky for this and is not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned to me and I will have a full refund.
This is also quite sad because the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# also come in large sizes, like 240/240 for example?
The #PRS_ORG# must ensure that the faulty wardrobe is picked up promptly.
And I kindly request that you take action now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, so I will disassemble the wardrobe as far as possible for pickup. They must clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that works.
#PRS_ORG# can contact me anytime by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for assembly?
How long did I have time to take care of this or to decide on the return?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I really like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, and now probably rarely eats meat.
I was a vegetarian for several years before.
In response to the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought.
And indeed, I long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but somehow I reflected and understood that in doing so, I would ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that she was showing displeasure on her side, and she defended vegetarianism, saying that she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, one could reduce animal suffering.
Now I ask myself if my answer was "too fat"?
How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without intention.
Hello, a harmonious vegan woman is greeting you.
This is not an exception as per Section 312d of the German Civil Code.
They do not release their #PRS_ORG# from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am at the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my retoures not on site.
Since I cannot be there for a funeral due to my location, unfortunately, it cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup time?
From February 1st, I will be available again continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserrettung is being equipped with a 45,000 Euro grant from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a decision on a grant of 45,000 Euros for the new rescue vehicle of the Lahnstein Volunteer Fire Department to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein Town Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle that has been in use since November 2020 is 135,000 Euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am happy that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein.
The equipment truck is used by the Taucherstaffel Lahnstein, one of seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill tasks under and over water in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they always count on increasing deployments: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, nothing worked.
I am a bit anxious because the whole action has taken up a lot of time and now I hope for help.
Okay, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS_ORG# collection for June.
Is it possible to enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values were determined at 21°C±3°C, 50%-80% humidity, and the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery in the Fenix Labor.
The values may vary depending on the type of flashlight used, age, and environment.
The burning time in the bright stage contains the burning time with reduced brightness due to overheating protection.

Thank you for being here for the whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar task, we were also bearers of arms in the executive, further I do not want to go into it!
I find the question of right and left always very simplified.
Generally, it should be said that a state employee is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It is clear that people in uniform and weapon carriers, who are naturally attractive to conservatives, should also understand that these people will have difficulty dealing with reality. Since you have people with an average white background, many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and I do not mean here the overly feminine stereotypical gay men, because they are rather rare in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women whom one does not notice when they do not tell anyone) and also on these people, I must rely, because in doubt, they will save your life or set it for you.
However, even these fringe groups represent a conservative stance, according to my experience, even when it sounds comical at first, they are proud of Germany and feel less alienated by excessive left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly represents them or tries to do them justice, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the right, since police and armed forces are also a cross-section of society, one can find extreme right-wingers there who openly express their views or even openly plot state-threatening plans, which is medially exaggerated and bothersome to me.
It is natural that police officers and soldiers, who have often been deployed abroad, sometimes begin to generalize and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to their negative experiences.
It also happens that right-minded companions meet who engage in lively exchange of thoughts.
Nevertheless, this is well fought against and also with political education and enlightenment is countered to the whole!
Germany is so internationally entwined and that's good in my opinion because we wouldn't be able to afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I placed my order in November.
I received confirmation of your order in your response.
The issue is still my order, which is no longer available for delivery.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could one deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro to Germany in black, or is this basket also available in Germany somewhere?
I always find you as my partner company.
However, on the edge of the wooden board are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
"Orderly through the child?"
Hello, I have been dealing with a matter for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (am self-employed, have very little free time), but even throughout my entire life, I have struggled to keep my household consistently clean and organized.
There are always phases where everything stays still, and then and now it grabs me and I clean up.
"But it's actually never the case that someone could spontaneously come to visit."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time he loses household tasks due to work and lack of interest.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook often.
"Have you managed to become more organized with your child?"
We don't have anything yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been bothering me for a while.
Because for me there is no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child give one a greater motivation, or does one remain lazy?
I am looking forward to your answers.
The exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically formed cut offers a maximum in comfort, a perfect fit, and enables nearly unrestricted movement freedom.

Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality?
I have completed a training in the field of software development and have been practicing for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, so I have been considering for a long time to start anew and study social work.
The problem: I have an insecure (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly translated, it means that I don't have any self-esteem and therefore I'm shy.
I don't have any problems talking to people on a professional level, but it's really hard for me to carry on casual conversations and I've been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I think I've improved on that).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
I know but I'm not sure if the concrete workday is really like how I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems for me in my job (emotionally), because every time something needs to be corrected in my code, it brings me down ("again, the simplest things are broken") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding them back with my dumb questions"/"they must think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I would probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you returned the sofa yet?
"Since there was no confirmation for that either."
I am waiting for a pickup time.
What do you mean by giving back please !
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, the message "Ihr #PRS_ORG# authorisiert dieses Buch nicht" appears.
Is there a problem there?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The bird breaks down the protein it consumes with its food into individual amino acids in its stomach-intestinal tract and uses these to build up its own protein tissues, which it also needs for feather growth.
The feather development in nestlings and the feather renewal in molting birds are extremely complex processes and are highly demanding for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that Nektar-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the reproductive process.
After this brief supply of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 gram of Nektar-Bio in 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A striped spoon (contained) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
When there are severe feather damages, at the beginning, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is completely finished.
Storage: The NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry and without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair will be sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break after 9 months?
In Germany, warranty claims are valid for 24 months.
This is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order had arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a Community Worker in Opposition to the Bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
A tree on our property is to be cut down.
An application has been submitted to the community.
One employee writes to me that the cutting down of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the statute.
In the constitution, however, the walnut is explicitly stated as a protected tree.
Can I rely on the statement of the colleague or not?
On one hand, I have to rely on an expert's opinion.
On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Naja, dann hab ich immer noch ein Sofa ohne Verwendung.
Could you offer me a bequest or a voucher?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I believe the question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the roof delivered to Germany.
Can you check it?
Urgent Report: Severe Traffic Accident in Selb

There are injured people.
Ah okay, I understand.
Good, then many thanks again, that it went so easily!
Advice and Ideas for Further Professional Development
"Happy Christmas for the first time to you!"
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre because my dear head just crumples everything that can be crumpled.
Before I start working here now, in short: I need advice and the best would be from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a beginner.
Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain somewhat anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun.
I eventually landed in the teaching profession and was convinced that it was the right fit for me - even though the framework conditions were much less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now on the third "I am searching for other job descriptions" page.
And it's only half a year away.
While painting, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the reference, after that I can always change my mind.
But just now I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted.
"Now it's vacation time, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me."
Before the weekend, I always thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend and my evening shift were both my weekend and my evening shift.
"There I was free."
And the stress at work was equal in those moments.
"Now family celebration is too much stress for me."
And then there are these rigid structures that make me even more nervous.
Generally, it's fun and from the outside looks good, considering the feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and ask myself, how much stress my body can withstand before it completely collapses - when it doesn't do that already.
I ask myself if I really want to spend the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you here - or if I should go back to the old area, where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although the work was somehow boring, it was appropriately paid and we worked together as a team and not as individual fighters like it is now most of the time.
Then I ask myself, if I will be in the same place a year from now and still be unhappy.
You notice that everything is somehow chaotic, but maybe you as an outsider have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely finished with and am starting to cry over the smallest thought.
I will not make decisions now based on emotions, as it is likely to lead to nothing good.
"But perhaps your opinions can help me see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or at least enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now."
Thank you for reading and I apologize for the melancholic undertone of my writing.
I hope my situation is at least a little clearer now.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, resulting in the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which accurately reproduces the behavior of a vacuum tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET-Technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of parts and circuits, VTX-Amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also contain the multistage Valvetronix vacuum tube preamplifier.
This relies partially on real analog circuits because these can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a vacuum tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuit, VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sparkle so.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly like you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor-Technology.
Understandably, it has been further refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed to provide all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety with a solution.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a quick response.
During an incoming analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end stage determines the tube character of the amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor-Technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of a VT+- amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 vacuum tube, perfectly captures the subtle nuances and sound character of a vacuum tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main subject is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable clamping parts, it adjusts perfectly to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash attachment.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 allow room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can also store a lot of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use a backpack for their equipment and for photography accessories.
Both drone pilots and everyday backpack users find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice because it provides ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro, remote control, and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: the longest in history.
In the past three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is there an end in sight?
The volcanic eruption on La Palma has been ongoing for 85 days now, making it the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted 84 days, is considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available about earlier eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in recent days, but volcanologists were still hesitant to make a prediction on when it would end.
The indicators are pointing to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, the president of the Canary Islands Council, to the state television broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions.
In the past three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
About 1200 hectares were covered by a thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million Euros.
Two new landmasses with a combined size of approximately 50 hectares formed along the coast due to cooled lava.
The banana plantation, which is of immense importance to the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend, was particularly heavily affected. The plantation had already been in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected.
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is knocking at the door and children especially won't be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, something seductive about them.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is so important to be conscious of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which Marcel Mauss, a French sociologist and ethnologist, considered a peace-making "social contract between savage peoples," can break free from rigid routine and be filled with life within the context of this tradition.
"Like Nicholas became the Christ Child"
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with giving.
Before Christmas, gifts were given in various ways on St. Nicholas's Day.
The background of this popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have thrown gold into the windows of three women in one night in order to spare them a life of sin.
The practice of filling children's shoes with gifts, which is popular in Germany, originated from an unconventional way of giving.
Protestants object to this practice because they reject the role of intermediaries between God and people as "worship of saints."
They protect themselves from the institution for these reasons.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Day.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details as closely, only a few are still annoyed that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's singing and Martin's parade, still remains a firm part of the Christmas season.
Today one can find everything from socks to luxurious watches under the Christmas tree that one's heart desires.
Variety of Traditions in Christian Countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving on St. Nicholas's Day dating back to the 13th century.
The day of giving was shifted to Christmas with the Reformation.
However, in all Christian countries, there is a cheerful bickering over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a type of Nikolaus, has been assigned some unique characteristics over time.
This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the stricter Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled drawn by reindeer, and the preference for the hearth to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure during Christmas celebrations.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia Father Frost gained some fame.
Here there are not cows, but three horses that pull the sled as a troika.
In Czechia, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, Christkind is responsible for delivering gifts.

I searched for a return label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning.

Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man from the police was shot on Saturday.
The police reported that a man with a weapon had been reported by callers who had gone into a bank and the accountant's office.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the crime scene.
The police were not acting from a terrorist background.
There are several embassies located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Additionally, members of the royal family reside there.
"Which one?"
No matter where I click, I will immediately be redirected to your side.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into every bed, garden area or rock garden.
The light can be simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with two stakes.
An integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum light duration of 10 hours.
The robust plastic production can be used all year round in the outdoor area.
In Hollywood movies, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with color.
Smart Stone, on the other hand, is completely harmless. The only thing that makes these solar lights fascinating is the sun, which shines on them - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The smooth, amorphous design is intentionally chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself at daylight.
His organic curves fit in every natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the flower bed.
He also makes himself known in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
Large preparations you can save: As Smart Stone solar lights do not require wiring or batteries.
Place the "light stone" on any spot that is exposed to sunlight during the day.
Two anchors, which are delivered, ensure a firm hold when needed.
The white plastic shell is sturdy and weather-resistant.
His solar module hides a "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light.
The battery charges as soon as sunlight hits the case.
As dusk falls, the "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you can determine the color yourself: six attractive light colors are available to you, in addition to daylight white.
Finally, the shutdown occurs automatically when the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it becomes light again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew on the next day.
I have done it multiple times, but it didn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have loved to order more from you, but if the voucher is not credited, then I won't order again out of principle.
If you have a different opinion, please let me know.
Otherwise, today was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
"There was no tree market open during the lockdown."
The motor control of LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable adjustable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures silent operation in Glockenankermotors - the typical "humming" sound belongs to the past.
The last rule can now be adjusted to up to 10 CVs for difficult cases.
The unique "Autotune" function enables the automatic alignment of the decoder with the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder delivers up to 1.5A motor current, which is enough juice for older motors.

Pillenproblem translates to "pill problem" in English.
Hello dear women,
I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pains during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
"Now I would like to stay here again because due to chronic illnesses, I have to take medications that I cannot choose."
My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had suddenly received 100 explosive-like pricks all over my body during my two-year break.
As far as I can tell, but it has really weighed me down and I didn't feel good about it.
In the two years of pause, nothing has ever really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this one.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without dyes, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me.
The female doctor didn't take me seriously and my dermatologist appointment is still coming up.
Thank you very much to everyone who read the novel!
Yes, love skin is such a thing.
If the mother had severe neurodermatitis before, then there was a time of rest, then there were large-scale knotty scabs and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything possible in the context of a Christian illness and have become dependent on a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat, because otherwise nothing has worked properly.
It can also be good that Hormonell is just a worm in there, but when you're like me and have construction sites everywhere, you'd rather stop looking for anything else that might go wrong.
I had already attended all of her seminars and workshops.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I had to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check when the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
However, he is generally available in large quantities.
The text "da er ja in schwarz groß verfügbar ist" translates to "He is widely available in black" in English.

In the name of the people: laypeople render judgments
In the courtroom, they are sitting on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
However, much depends on their verdict, even if they do not wear a robe: Judges, along with lawyers, determine whether and for how long someone is sentenced to prison.
Two of them are reporting in conversation with the "Public" from their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.

Does the wardrobe have to be completely disassembled for pickup and replacement?
And when is the pickup?
A new 110-kV power cable will be built in 2022.
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally binding.
The decision by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
The Bayernwerk network operator is now sharing this.
The seven-kilometer long cable will connect the Tann substation in the north of the community to the existing 110-kilovolt power line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the power line near the town of Edermanning, Reut.
Good morning,
My order from January 3, 2021 with order number #NUMBER# has only partially arrived at our location.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
The other three packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is now?
"Here's to a beautiful start to the week!"
You can forget that, I explained it several times yesterday!!
This is a glass cabinet and all the sides are shattered, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The wardrobe is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations.
This means that the furniture cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
"But why only 20 euros?"
The initial value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request is at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem.
"Lesson planning (EK)"
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I currently have big problems planning time-efficient lessons in the subject of Geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technologically, so I can basically only use the table, the textbook, and an OHP as a medium.
At school, I can only copy s/w for free (which annoys me for geography).
Currently, I need a very long time to plan my hours.
We are currently working on the topic of Geofactors and for me, every hour is crucial.
In principle, methods are repeated, but on the other hand, I also do not want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I usually start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with the most tasks in the book, I am rather unhappy.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Perhaps I can work with a geography teacher who is efficient with the book someday.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided on a new job at #PRS_ORG#, however, I would really like to get the retoure over with as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G-regulation during the Christmas business.
Only those who are vaccinated or have recovered are allowed in most shops.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains about declining sales.
He also has a possible solution prepared.
The 2G regulations are harming the important Christmas business for the German Trade Association (HDE) from the perspective of individual trade.
According to HDE-CEO Stefan Genth, there are declines in sales when dealing with non-essential goods.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 dealers, more than 70% of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively.
Many had already finished their Christmas shopping.
"What was supposed to be the positive highlight of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth.
Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost about a third of their pre-crisis funds in the past week.
"Good business only runs in the single-handled retail of daily necessities and in the online sector."
The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the head of business.
"Bringing 2G during shopping does not help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel input.
He argued that the bundesweit zugelassen should be the Bändchenregelung.
After that, each customer must only be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all stores with the received card on that day.
In addition, as in the public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), random spot checks should be sufficient in individual trade.
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specializing in shopping centers, also reported a challenging Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona level, and the sales were around 90%.
"These numbers will surely fall right in the middle of the crucial Christmas business," said Wilhelm Wellner, CEO of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, they can enter all shops without interruption." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error on the frame, which was tried to be covered up with yellow putty.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repacked it and sealed it back into the package.
How should I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
A modern microprocessor takes care of setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, with exceptional possibilities.
Besides the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash storage.
A special feature of the controller is its simplicity and intuitive operation.
The light produces a very bright stream of soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
This is a great tool to work with either on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller enables remote control of lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
The slot for the NP-F battery is still located there (not included in the delivery).
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To save the settings of individual settings to the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the save buttons for a longer period of time until finished.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality because it allows for operation with favorable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can check if the batteries have enough power before setting - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, there is a value displayed in the two display windows (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display).
Additionally, it is of course possible to continuously supply the projector with power through the supplied network component.
The construction of the flashlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm shell for reinforcement, so you can directly connect it to your photographic stand.
The inclination can be reliably determined by measuring on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components were of extremely high quality and therefore designed for durability and harsh usage.
Additionally, there is a swivel mechanism included in the delivery range.
It is grossly inappropriate that there is also a bag included in the delivery.
This means that you can transport or store all the accessories that you may want to buy along with the lights without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received a gift that was too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a successful comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen team, who had lost their last two games in a row, were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga crisis.
But then the SGE turned on, shot itself within a good hour with frustration over a weak start to the season, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys did today," trainer Oliver Glasner jubilated on DAZN and gave a "general praise" to everyone who was there.
At first, it looked like there was a new dampener for the Frankfurt team, which was still nine points behind their expectations.
Patrik Schick had taken a 2-0 lead for Leverkusen.
What happened also surprised the SGE trainer.
"The players have returned and shown a fantastic performance," said Glasner.
I am absolutely crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result.
Also defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game day and his overcome muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is unbelievably large," said the 27-year-old and was delighted with a look at the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to mock today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, as he feels well prepared in terms of the personnel situation.
It is remarkable that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live professionally.
Now we want to "go step by step and remain modest" and complete the tasks "at this level until the turn of the year."
Next, there is an away game scheduled for Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (18.30, Sky) on the schedule.
I am receiving a grade for the package that was returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and redirect the call, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is reissued?
If that were the case, then unfortunately it would mean that I wouldn't order again because it has already taken too long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chair?
Dampers for women's handball before the quarterfinals against Spain.
The German women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty gazes after being humiliated by Denmark.
At the end of the World Cup group stage, the DHB team lost 16:32 (8:13) to the host team Spain in front of 800 spectators in Granollers. As a result, they will face Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must act differently towards Spain.
After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points, in second place behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game that we had to end," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In order to advance to the semifinals, Germany must significantly improve its performance against the second-place finisher from the 2019 World Cup on Tuesday, in order to keep alive the dream of winning the first medal since 2007.
Alina Grijseels, a German discus thrower, faced off against the three-time Olympic gold medalist from Denmark in the duel. She managed to throw six targets.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense", defender Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We must now quickly look forward".
From front to back not at the height
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team was not at its best from the start.
Defects and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 lead after seven minutes.
Dinah Eckerle, the peat woman, was immediately on temperature and prevented worse with some tricks.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes when Grijseels successfully executed a quick counterattack.
The expected initial ignition was not this, however.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an appearance - and when they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since the defender Mia Zschocke got a red card shortly after due to a hard foul on her opponent.
She is allowed to participate again in the quarterfinals.
The DHB selection began to play better in the final phase of the first half and by the break had at least closed the gap to five goals.
The faint hope of a catch-up chase after the switch was already gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
The Greens apologized in all areas and made it easy for their well-prepared opponent, who was a contender for the medals in the final round, to win.
Afterwards, the German team could not manage to improve their performance and left the court as clear losers.

Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children as well?
What is the most beautiful thing for children?
The stepchild's shoe?
Do you want to bake cookies?
"Do you want to decorate the trees?"
Would you like to play music?
Is the Christmas man, the Christ child or is the gift actually from grandma and grandpa?
Regardless of how you do it, everyone puts in effort around Christmas to make it as beautiful as possible as a family.

"in the same way as with #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers"
How is it going with them?
The title suggests that I am an impunity doctor working in mobile impunity teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer impunity vaccine is administered, mainly in nursing homes.
Once these are mostly done, I will continue to some extent at vaccination centers.
I like to answer questions about organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, how does that relate to the vaccine?").
My tasks include informing about vaccination, determining indications (the person has a right to vaccination under the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance and there are no reasons against it), documenting medical treatment, and possibly providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The administration of the vaccine can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical specialized staff.
In vaccination teams, we often do not have any pharmaceutical-technical assistants available, but only (thank God no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants who are not authorized to administer vaccinations, so that I have to administer most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Butcher"-Questions: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
The use of this dialect word, sent from Amberg, has caused concern in the BR-TV program "We in Bavaria" for intense reflection.
However, unlike many preceding days, the concept remained unrecognized by the callers in the series "Host mi?" this time.
No, there was no "nervous person".
And no one, "who everything has to go fast".
The people heard from the TV moderator was completely false.
The man from Amberg shared the solution, which likely caused surprise among many people in Upper Palatinate.
"The butcher, the audience realized, is a piece of cloth with which someone wipes the oven."
Antony Rowley, a dialect researcher who has been interviewed by Bayerischen Fernsehen for years as an expert, confirmed it.
With the note that this is a typical Bavarian term, somehow derived from the more well-known Mundart word "Houdern".
What closed the education gap - well also for those who have been living in Amberg for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, there is always the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have started, connected, synchronized, and repaired the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n with the PC.
"Nothing helped."
"Tire selection for racing bikes - really that reliable?"
I woke up full of energy this morning because I wanted to do some training before my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I rode my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday.
The first 40km were really beautiful - but then what happened in every city (this time: thank you Krefeld!) occurred.
Glassblower on the road.
Zack, the loud ringing and my sore rear end didn't want to join the rest of the route anymore.
Since I couldn't find a replacement jacket and hose on account of the day of the week, I had to turn back with a bad mood and take the first train home.
Even though it's not so bad from a technical standpoint, maybe it's better if I practice with the tire change before the bike tour.
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I had to cover a relatively long distance over several days, I didn't want to face this problem often.
"It's not that bad now, since the old tires from the previous owner (such a nice old man, he was there when I picked up the bike at 14:00 and had ridden 120 km on them!) and the one who considered them suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years were also available."
When I think about having to change a tire after driving 80-90 kilometers, then I really feel down :D
Now I am talking to an older man at the train station who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbreakable.
"Now it all sounds very tempting naturally."
"But are they really so indestructible?"
I am not in the mood to spend 40 euros on tires now, only to be disappointed.
I am still asking myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) wider Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you generally recommend different tires for a racing bike?
It seems to me that the Swallow page is more suitable for absolute beginners. Would you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you again in advance for your help and loving greetings!

Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will also hold the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which means a higher planning effort is required and is explained by the short-term announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people on the switch, so we can follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
"But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible."
It will leave around 0:30.
"Always prepare cold drinks, plan good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night."
