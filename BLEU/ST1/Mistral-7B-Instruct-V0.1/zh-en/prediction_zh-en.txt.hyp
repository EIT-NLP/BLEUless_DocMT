"Okay, I'm sorry."
I think it's very meaningful to have a rescue certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates, besides the driving license, that I think is valuable!
The translation for the given text from Chinese to English is as follows:  "普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。"  "Popularize below: Emergency measures are actually done for emergency rescue when a sudden event occurs, which is rescue before the ambulance arrives."
Everyone knows that the process of getting an ambulance to the scene of an accident takes some time, and it is precisely during this time that is the most critical.
This is the time when urgent rescue is needed.
If I really had a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then our window of life would only be four minutes, golden four minutes!
That's why it's so important for people around you to know how to perform first aid!
When someone collapses beside us, we can use our specialized knowledge to perform resuscitation, rather than standing there foolishly doing nothing, which gives us a helpless feeling that is truly terrifying.
"In China, we have an official data of 300,000 unexpected deaths every year, the most dangerous one is called heart attack."
In the United States, on average, 15% can be rescued.
In Las Vegas's gambling hotel, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is the first response from founder Luo Lei.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest, breathing stops, and the heartbeat stops, squeezing the person's chest is ineffective.
It is necessary to do artificial respiration and external chest compression to have any chance of rescuing a person.
I found that there are very few people who have this awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation happens, it's too late. So I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can make a timely response when facing sudden situations.
It is uncertain whether it is possible to save a person's life!
You can sign up for an emergency response certificate at the Red Cross training center in your local area. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Shenzhen. Students also have a discount.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before I turned 25. Adding an emergency certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I actually completed it!
After finishing the other exams I wanted to take, I planned to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw a scuba diving rescue certificate on little red book before, so I thought I should take this one first, but then I realized that I might need a rescue certificate to take the scuba diving one, so it's actually quite useful to have a rescue certificate!
I ordered #NUMBER#.

"Chongqing Middle School Pilots Modern Student System, Enrollment Equals Enterprise Employee - Xinhua Net"
Yesterday, a reporter learned from the municipal education committee that starting from this year, our city will pilot the "modern apprentice training model" for talent cultivation in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for trial training will simultaneously possess apprentice status, and after enrollment and registration, they will be pre-recorded as employees of trial enterprises.
The Municipal Education Committee requires the standardization of the recruitment and employment process for vocational schools and enterprises, clearly defining the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise employees, and implementing the principle of mutual selection. Students, schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and for students who are not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement should be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise, to determine each party's rights and responsibilities, as well as the specific job position, teaching content, and rights protection for the student in the workplace.
Encourage trial schools to adopt modern student forms and cooperate with enterprises to conduct enterprise employee pre-job training and post-job training.
The school wants to reform the model for cultivating talent.
The school and enterprise jointly design a talent cultivation plan, jointly draft specialized teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher and apprentice standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
"Use the development of academic system as a trial period, and determine the internship time for students in enterprises according to the talent cultivation plan, with top-level internship usually lasting 6 months."
In enterprise practice, it is necessary to implement the enterprise team management mode, according to the characteristics of different majors, one master can lead 2 to 5 apprentices, forming a learning small group, to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the schedule, from 2016 to August 2019, my city determined 60 city-level vocational school test points, with each test point having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (students) were trained.
According to the principle of "trying it out first and then scaling up," explore the effective mechanism for building school-enterprise cooperation in recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation to improve students' job skills, increase their employment rate, and enhance the quality of employment.

"The transmission power of Omicron is strong, but most cases are mild."
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that diseases caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, even though the Omicron variant spreads more quickly.
According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the Western Cape province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are generally milder, such as body aches and coughs similar to those of the flu.
Dr. Unben Pillay, the head of the organization, stated that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pele said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said, this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, these people are more susceptible to severe illness from the coronavirus infection.
He said, compared to the previous Delta wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, the patients he treated had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels.
"Many people will be hospitalized within a few days."
Two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant virus in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it may take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observation and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in South Africa, among the recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% had severe illness, which is half of the severe illness rate in the previous wave; the average hospital stay was shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the death rate among recent COVID-19 patients was only 3%, while the death rate among the early cases in South Africa was 20%.
Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data and reports from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases to say, "Currently, almost all signs indicate that this is a mild disease."
He said: "Even now, we need to obtain future data."
In normal circumstances, hospitalization and death usually occur later in time, but we entered this pandemic wave only two weeks ago.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while simultaneously testing the effectiveness of the current vaccines and treatment methods.
Despite Delta still being the main virus strain globally, Omicron cases have been reported in more than ten countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to the health officials, the number of new cases in Shandong province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and the test showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.

"Drawing strength from the hundred-year struggle of the Party"
The Hunan Daily reported on December 10th, 2021 (full media reporter Qian Baowei) according to the provincial committee's unified arrangement, on December 10th in the morning, provincial committee member and propaganda department director Yang Haodong gave an interactive speech at the Marble Mountain Video Art and Creativity Yard, deeply studying the spirit of the 19th plenary session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, studying the spirit of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, on important speeches and important instructions on important matters in Hunan, and studying the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress.

"In reality, I don't know if it's the shop's mistake or the delivery person's mistake."
The bag does not have any documents.
"I couldn't find you."
I hope you understand a little.
Because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than the displayed time.
"No more, thank you."
Yes, I have changed my rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has been saying "processing" for a long time.
The text "等了几个小时" translates to "I waited for a few hours" in English.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know.
However, the restaurant does not know why the delivery time is constantly delayed.
Original text: 原来要 #NUMBER#  Translation: The original plan was #NUMBER#.
"In the end, I didn't call you."
"I didn't eat."
I will definitely complain.
"You won't be able to send it, so why not talk earlier?"
"Wait for you for so long"
"No, I haven't received the call."
Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
I waited for an hour at a restaurant.
The translation for the given text from Chinese to English is: "Not yet delivered."
I want to cancel the order.
What is the reason for not canceling?
Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is alive.
I want to try playing basketball, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a court with a similar price first to practice.
"Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't distinguish, the expensive one is usually more friendly than the cheap one, this type of 'entry-level bid' is actually industrial waste."
The strength is very low, the ball hits the cover, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and all high-handed players have difficulty controlling it.
The logic and implicit meaning behind this is that playing tennis is difficult, you know you won't be able to learn it, and you also know you won't be willing to buy expensive equipment, so you'll find some cheap stuff to fool you, you'll play twice and then you won't want to play again, so this set is cheap, and you won't worry about it.
Can you really distinguish between good and bad, that means you have made progress, then come back to my place to buy expensive things, I will earn twice the money.
The suggestion is to buy a second-hand tennis racket that is similar in price to flowers, choosing between Prince or Wilson, as these two brands are not very famous, so the tennis racket will not sell well at a high price. A new tennis racket for 500-600 yuan is good, and a second-hand tennis racket for 200 yuan can be enjoyed with a thousand-yuan tennis racket.
The newcomers are very friendly, but once they get past the newcomer stage, they become complacent, but most people, especially women, can't get past the newcomer stage.
The delivery time of the order has been delayed multiple times.
Would you be able to follow along?
Delay
Thank you.
"Are you asking if I already have credit?"
Do I need to place a new order? Did you ignore the previous order?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but the food that was delivered was missing many items, and the chicken in the soup was still alive.

"Train 10,000 village primary school music and speech teachers in Jiangxi within three years - Xinhua News Agency"
According to a recent report from the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, in order to enhance the ability of the shortage of subject teachers and ensure balanced development of rural compulsory education, since 2016, Jiangxi Province has planned to train 1,000 qualified music, art, and physical education teachers for each small school in the countryside (township and below) within three years.
According to the information, the target objects for this training are teachers who have a solid foundation in the subjects of music, art, and physical education, and are capable of teaching other courses related to these subjects.
Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of sound art education, update their teaching ideas and beliefs, master modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, build a team of multi-talented sound art teachers, alleviate the shortage of sound art teachers in rural areas.

This will comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leadership ability, teaching research activity organization ability, teaching ability, network research and modification workshop building ability, and play the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
Because it has been waiting for 20 minutes, it has already waited for 1 hour #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want food that was prepared 1 hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous erroneous order.
"But I can't see my car tire anymore."
Hello, how long will it take for the food you ordered to be delivered?
The person has finished work.
Your bike phone number is #PHONENUMBER#, name is #NAME#
Could you please provide a reasonable explanation?
Yes, but your bike is not in good condition, please take care of it.
Can you check if he is still on the road? If so, please send him.
OK, if you really don't have it, return the payment for the order.
In reality, there are many particularities when it comes to matching outfits with overweight girls' bodies.
A girl with a chubby body can't wear short or long skirts, the length should be about the same as her knees, just long enough to cover the chubby thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs.
If someone is too tall, they will give others a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear your clothes divided into three parts - top, middle, and bottom - it will make you look taller, by using different colors for your upper body, skirt, and long leggings, it will give you a feeling of elongation.
In reality, many dark-colored clothes are the staple of overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and high-end black short skirts are the first choice of overweight girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothes, especially black short pants, will make people feel like you've lost some weight.
If your legs are fat, make sure your socks and shoes aren't too tight-fitting and attention-grabbing.
The more popular something becomes, the better it is, but the colors should not be too bright.
Please be careful not to draw attention to your legs and feet, so that people get a feeling of being fat.
For the slightly chubby little girl, it is definitely important to know the keys to dressing well and looking good.
Don't wear tight-fitting short skirts, and your top should not be too short or too tight-fitting inside the skirt, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, you should wear black long-legged socks or fishnet socks (the kind with holes), and choose soft, printed leggings. Pair with a blouse with a V-neck, which can effectively hide the flaws of a chubby girl.
Certainly, a girl who is overweight should also pay attention to what she wears, even if she is wearing short skirts.
A fat girl wearing short pants should choose a top that matches the color of her pants. This will give the illusion of increasing the height of her plump figure.
Pairing short skirts with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most fashionable combination for summer!
If you have a chubby upper body but thin legs (MM), I recommend choosing a dress with a luxurious feel.
Not only can it cover the big stomach, but it can also showcase your advantages.
Wearing A-line skirts can make you look slimmer, they are more suitable for overweight girls, and the top should be fitted a bit tighter to create a layering effect and make you look even slimmer.
A simple and white T-shirt paired with short pants is also suitable for overweight MM to try.
A girl who is underweight can also wear fashionable clothes.
If you can master the rules of dressing well, then even overweight girls will become the center of attention for everyone.
"Since there have been changes in fashion coordination, it's important to exercise more in daily life and strive to be an early riser to avoid being labeled as a 'microbeauty' girl. 😊"

I am following an order.
This person hasn't contacted me for an hour, this is definitely an online scam.

After the investigation is complete, you will also say it like this! I checked the address several times before placing the order.

The loudest gasping sound comes from the new mountain area long-distance running!
This time, our team has brought a car for everyone, which is the dream of many men.
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago model — Aventador LP700-4!
The LP700 costs around 200,000 yuan, and the annual road tax for it is around 10,000 yuan. It has four wheels, so why is it called LP700?
Can you imagine how fast you would be with 700 horsepower?
"I don't know if the small editor is aware of this, but the data shows that accelerating from 0 to 100 km/h only takes 2.9 seconds. It's probably the case that the small editor's myvi reaches 30 km/h before the other car reaches 100 km/h, huh."
The low and sleek body, the bold cut-out doors, the large intake vents that cover the entire body, and the 6.5 v12 engine visible under the glass, perfectly embody Lamborghini's style.
The explanation of the car model does not require too much, just a simple Google search will do. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google.
The place is too popular, everyone is looking at it, it's not comfortable! (Actually it's a bit cool)
"1 kilometer of oil costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care)"
The posture for getting in and out of a car should be practiced a bit, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because it will be difficult to get out of the car and get stuck halfway)
The engine sound is too loud, and you will instantly feel deaf after getting off the car. (But it's still pretty cool)
The car is too big, it will be very narrow to park it in a normal parking space, and I am afraid that when the car next to it opens its door, it will hit me!

The maximum duration for Guangxi university students to take a break for entrepreneurship is 5 years - Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, Guangxi, May 19, 2021 (Reporter Zhang Nan) Recently, a reporter learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Autonomous Region that starting from now on, Guangxi's universities will implement a flexible academic system, relax the academic year limit for university students, and extend the limit for university students to engage in entrepreneurship on campus from the original academic system basis by 2 to 5 years. The time for entrepreneurship during the rest period will be regarded as practical education time.
To promote the entrepreneurship and innovation abilities of college students, the departments of education and social affairs in Guangxi jointly built an entrepreneurship platform. They established more college student extracurricular practice teaching bases, college science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external protection for college students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the innovation and entrepreneurship practice base area of each high school should be at least 3000 square meters, and the high vocational school should be at least 2000 square meters.
The government encourages high schools to set up innovation and entrepreneurship courses, giving priority support to students who excel in practical innovation and entrepreneurship.
High school teachers are required to have at least two months of on-the-job training in industry enterprises every two years in order to improve their awareness and ability to innovate and start businesses in education.
The autonomous region education department requires all high schools in Guangxi to deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, in order to strive for every college student to participate in a innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school period.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in various level and type innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, for giving me unique wedding photos.
Thank you for all the hard work of the photographers who took the wedding photos today. We look forward to seeing the completed album.
Taking wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for photographers who have to run and jump around.
The makeup artist was very caring and designed a makeup style that suited my face shape. The photographer had a humorous style, which was worth praising.
Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist, may I still be able to look so beautiful in my lifetime.

After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "photoshopped".
The translation of the given text from Chinese to English is as follows:  "Chinese-American groups file complaints against Ivy League schools for discrimination against Chinese students - Xinhua News Agency"
On May 23rd, 2021, over 130 Asian American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, opposing the discrimination against Asian American applicants at three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Duke University during the admissions process.
The Asian Education League, which initiated the appeal, held a press conference in Washington D.C. yesterday.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yúxiān, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions of American Ivy League schools has grown exponentially in the past 10 years. However, the proportion of Asians in these three American Ivy League schools has basically maintained the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" recruitment process have long-term and systematically discriminated against Asian applicant students.
Zhao Yukun introduced that according to research conducted by scholars in 2014, the ratio of Asian applicants to all ethnic groups is the lowest in these three universities.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Duke University have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota system for Asian applicants that has been in place for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope to submit an appeal, and the US Department of Education and Justice Department can conduct an investigation after recognizing the facts, and take measures to prevent these colleges from continuing to discriminate against Asian students.
They also hope that the university will actively pay attention to this issue and change its recruitment policy towards Asians.
Currently, there is no response from the three high schools that have been complained about.
The Chinese-American Education Coalition was established in 2015. At that time, it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of programmatic reasons.
The organizations participating in this appeal, besides the American Chinese community, also include the American Indian community, Korean community, Japanese community, and Pakistani community in the field of education.
The translation for "需要餐具" from Chinese to English is "I need utensils".

In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory located in Xiangjiang Yuyue Xiangquan Town through a house visit. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Li decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Li purchased the details of the factory building with the owner of the house and the family of the owner, Lin, through negotiations. On the same day, he transferred 20,000 yuan to the bank as a down payment.
Lin Some is signing as the payee on the "Factory Room Purchase and Payment Terms" document, which clearly states that if the buyer does not want to buy this factory room, the deposit will be returned to the seller, and if the seller does not want to sell this factory room, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller, and both parties agree to sign the factory room purchase and sale contract within one week.
However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the sale range of the factory and the payment method, the house purchase and sale contract was delayed in signing.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin Some returned 20,000 yuan in deposit to Luo First several days later.
After a long time of finding the right house, the deposit was paid and the down payment was ready. All that was left was to sign the contract before moving in. However, the seller suddenly refused to sell, leaving Mr. Li feeling helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Liang sued Mr. Lin to the Baluyao People's Court.
The court, after reviewing the case, determined that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it could not be solely blamed on the defendant. Therefore, this case should not be applied to the penalty for breach of contract, and the defendant should not be held responsible for returning double the penalty for breach of contract.
After the first instance judgment, the defendant raised an appeal.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer Reminder] It is necessary to exercise caution and due diligence during the transaction process.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due caution, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by people, and other relevant information. It is also necessary to clearly specify the specific delivery time and location in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.
"Okay, I'm afraid he might have sent the wrong address."

The aroma is great, I love meat, and the service is warm.
It's been a long time since I last ate fruit, but it's still as delicious as ever. The true ingredients and freshness make it even better. Today was my first time trying skewered meatballs, and it was love at first bite - the soft, southern-style noodle buns were irresistible!
The fried rice is perfectly dry and moist, the portion size is very large, the signboard is as usual, the chicken wings are fresh, the soup is also not bad, and the cilantro processing is also quite good.
The taste is great, the service is warm, and I love meat.
The Day Chang Store was once a popular existence among netizens many years ago, located on Dong Xiang Xiǎo Lóu, with wooden floorboards.
The steamed buns at the door always take a long time to eat, and all the pots for making steamed buns have cracked...
It has been several years since I last went to Jiangcheng, and the rise of various small shops selling Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow.
It's rare to find a seat as soon as you walk into a store, and the quality of the food is always excellent, just as expected.
The flavor is praised, meat is praised, the main dish is praised.
Rìcháng wàimǎi.
The meal was slightly disappointing this time.
The three-cup chicken: The vegetables are a little bit too much, and the chicken meat is a little bit too little.
The main flavor of this dish has a slight deviation, the bottom taste is not salty enough, so the sweet flavor is more prominent, everyone can imagine sweet + various spices mixed with vegetables...
What is the law against drinking whisky with a red label in Scotland?
Everyone's interests are different, some people like collecting, some people like food, of course, some people like drinking wine, red label whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in each country, and red label whisky has won the gold award in the International Wine and Spirits Competition.
Each bottle of red label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to savor it, you might ruin its aroma.
What is the proper way to drink red label whisky?
"I will give you a simple introduction."
The Red Card Warning Against Drinking in Scotland:  In Scotland, it is illegal to drink alcohol in public places while displaying a red card. This law is in place to prevent public drunkenness and related incidents. Anyone found guilty of violating this law can face penalties, including fines and even imprisonment. It is important to respect the laws and regulations of the country you are visiting, and to drink responsibly at all times.
Zhùn nǐ huì jiā hóngpái wèishìyòu yòu yào 35 zhòngguān wèishìyòu chǎo hé, pòsì hé zhòngguān wèishìyòu chǎo hé, dàng yǒu zhòngxīng xiāng hé chéngtràn zhòngguān wèishìyòu chǎo hé. Zhòngxīng xiāng zhōng hé dàng yǒu gānmiàn hé yànxiāng xiāng huā.
The entrance is sweet and refreshing, with a slight hint of grassy and strong smoky aroma of malt.
This wine can be directly chilled and consumed, or mixed with your favorite drinks to enjoy.
The red label whisky is not allowed to enter China. In order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, red label whisky plus Coca-Cola or Sprite or other carbonated beverages have become a lasting fashion trend.
These sweet drinks not only can neutralize sour taste, but also can bring visual enjoyment to people, when added into drinks, it can achieve the effect of diluting alcohol taste and changing mouthfeel.
The combination of red wine, lemon slices, and sugar (or sand sugar) is the most traditional and authentic way to drink.
The taste of red wine is slightly sour and spicy. Adding sugar can mellow out the sour taste, and lemon will give it a fresh and clean aroma. Of course, the sweetness and sourness can be adjusted according to personal preference.
The three methods mentioned above are the best ways to drink red wine according to the Chinese red wine taboo, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction will be helpful to you.
If it is not possible to change the store location for me, can it be delivered outside?
No, I don't have to give you any more money, do I?
The order of my colleague has been completed.
"I can't finish it."
"GPS? Have you arrived yet?"
The translation of the given text from Chinese to English is as follows:  "Golden Wife Wedding Photography (South Street Store) is currently without branches."
Before taking photos, we didn't have our time scheduled properly, so we had to reschedule twice. Lan Lan, the advisor, was very patient in helping us arrange the time.
"Later, he chose a weekend with good weather to take pictures."
The staff of the gold wife are all excellent, whether they are consultants, makeup artists or photographers.
That was the first time in my life that I formally put on makeup, wow! I can't believe it, I'll be that beautiful one day too, haha.
Xiǎojīng hé liǎosì huāxiàn huāxiàn chōngyǒu yǒuxīn, huāxiàn yě hěn zhōngxīn.  Translation: Xiǎojīng and another sister (I'm sorry I don't remember her name) put on makeup so patiently, and putting on makeup was very natural.
The scenery in Jiangwan City was photographed outside, fortunately the weather was good that day, it wasn't too cold, and the photographer kept paying attention to our clothes and accessories. If there was something a little off, they would immediately help us straighten it out.
The photographer is also very witty, and after taking photos all day, he feels very happy.
When taking photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to make the customer delete too many photos, but in reality, there was no intention to add more photos, and we directly took 24 photos, none of which were added. (I heard that our sister who took wedding photos around the same time took around 7,000 suits and added around 100,000 photos. At that time, I was stunned and scared that I would choose too many.)
"The photos were fixed today. Lanlan gave them to me, I looked at them and found two that weren't good, and they immediately helped me fix them again."
I compared the photographs that my sister took before with the ones I have, and I think our pictures are really satisfactory. They are simple, clear and clean, which is exactly the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xiàn Hàn Jīn Fūrén Fān Xuān Hé to take wedding photos!
The set price is 3999 yuan.
Thank you for your sincere wishes for our happiness and prosperity. May our future be as bright as gold!

Your name is Zheng Meng, this is your second week in Japan.
You were walking on the street when suddenly you realized someone was following you. You became scared and started running faster and faster until you finally ran away.
The person behind you is calling: "Miss! Please wait a moment!" (Full Japanese dialogue) You stopped your feet at the convenience store door.
"Miss... I am a director, I think you are very pretty, are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are feeling uncertain and afraid that this is a scam.

"If you have time, we can talk at the company. The bonus is definitely not missing."
You arrived at the company looking disheveled, and he said he saw you right away on the street and was very happy that you could come to the event.
You signed the contract because you thought there would be no loss and you could still make money.

There are 3200 newborn babies without birth certificates because of special anti-counterfeit paper shortage.
(Yaxing 11th News) The Sandbao National Registration Bureau said that since October, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to special anti-counterfeit paper used for storage, and the total number of affected people has reached 3,200.
However, the head of the local office, Kalu Aminusi, assured that all infants whose birth certificates have been applied for have had their information recorded in the system. As soon as the fake paper arrives next week, it will be supplemented.
He, at the news conference, explained the long-lasting reporting of 10 months on the issue of Sina's net media's Xinbao newspaper printing, which had occurred.
He said, the issue had appeared 2 months ago, and Xinjiang also faced the same problem.
"One reason is that the Chinese factory producing counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, causing a delay in delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used in Shenzhen for printing newspapers is different from that in other regions, so it is not possible to borrow goods from other provinces.
Amicus revealed that the latest batch of counterfeit paper arrived in Guangzhou on June 6th and was delivered to the printing company on the 8th, for some printing work to be done.
"The office will send people to Kuala Lumpur to pick up goods on Thursday, and then immediately proceed with the final stage of printing in Sabah. It is estimated that it will take about 2 more work days (December 20th) to deliver the goods to the applicant's hands."
"We will notify the applicants to go to different district branches to pick up birth certificates."
He has supplemented, Saba has issued 22,480,001 birth certificates this year.

The feeling is not big, it's heavy, one hand can't hold it, but it's not big in reality. It's a little bigger than 15.6 inches, but it's very stable and doesn't feel slow. I like the sound of the fan for cooling, it has a good feeling, and it doesn't spin like a game console all the time.
The products are good, cheaper than the official flagship store, and they also sent a backpack, I think it's great.
The service at the store is not bad, and they reminded me to update my bios and opened it promptly.
"Worth it!"
Translation:  Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation is very good, almost no temperature. Lightweight degree: It is convenient to carry. External appearance material: Thinkpad traditional design, satisfying.
Reputable seller, meticulously inspect the exterior of the whole machine, all interfaces, no traces of repaired or used, indeed it is a new version of the machine with the same configuration as the page.
I forgot to bring my backpack, and immediately helped me get a new one. Although it's not the original brand backpack, the service was good enough to prove that it's a trustworthy seller.
If a friend needs to buy a notebook, go back and buy one.
Exterior appearance material: The exterior atmosphere displays effect: The screen resolution can be seen, clear, lightweight degree: It has a certain sense of quality, because the heavier things feel better.
The effect of heat dissipation: I tried it initially, and I will evaluate it later.
The keyboard feels pretty good when typing, and it also came with a mouse and a converter. This configuration is quite practical compared to the national standard, and overall it's a great deal for the price. As for the machine performance, let's evaluate it after using it for a while.
This screen is really relaxing!
The translation for the given text from Chinese to English is as follows:  "Use it smoothly, and come back to evaluate it after some time!"

The assessment work for the special talent entrance examination in Beijing city's initial middle schools was uniformly organized by the education committees of each district on the 21st and 22nd.
This year, the special talent recruitment ratio in each district of Beijing has been compressed, and the competition for special talents has become more intense.
In the Dongcheng district, the proportion of special talent students entering primary to junior high school should not exceed 5% of the total number of students recruited in the district this year. The total number of students recruited in the district is 380, and the proportion of students who attend school should not exceed 10% of the total number of students recruited by the school.
Students who possess special talents in sports, arts, and technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent recruitment examination.
To facilitate students' attendance of exams, the eastern district continued the examination arrangement from last year, setting 1 to 2 examination sites in each district, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination areas according to the examination zones, and the time segments are divided into hours.

"48-hour negative nucleic acid test results, set 'buffer zone' as the national-level joint prevention and control mechanism requires strengthening the prevention and control of the epidemic in key port cities - Xinhua News"
The Xinhua News Agency reported on December 11, 2021, that the State Council issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic in port cities on the mainland (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau). According to the notice, people who have recently left port cities on the mainland (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) must have a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours before arriving at port cities on the mainland. After arriving at port cities on the mainland, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city range within each province, municipality, and county, to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice proposes that conditioned border city can be set up as a buffer zone for disease control in the jurisdiction.
The responsible person of the Disease Prevention and Control Bureau of the National Health and Welfare Commission introduced the situation in some border cities, where cross-border trade is the main economic pillar of the local area, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent.
Implementing differential management policies based on division, the outer control line for preventing overflow becomes two lines, with the hope of moving the front line closer to the entrance, compressing the risk of epidemic outbreak, and achieving the greatest success in epidemic prevention with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, many local cluster outbreaks of diseases have occurred in China, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities.
The above notice points out that there were issues with timely monitoring of some areas, inadequate closure management of high-risk personnel, insufficient periodic nucleic acid testing, incomplete disinfection of cold chain products at all stages, unstandardized management of central isolation facilities, and inadequate scientific precision in emergency response to the epidemic.
Notice Requirement: Strengthen the disease prevention and control mechanism, improve the health monitoring warning system, implement strict border control measures, etc. from 9 aspects to quickly fill the gaps and weaknesses in the disease prevention and control of the border city, and strictly and scientifically do a good job in disease prevention and control work, tightly weave and fortify the outer defense line against input prevention.
Notification emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention control and public welfare work, publish and widely disseminate the public welfare hotline, regularly check the hidden dangers of basic life resources supply and price, and promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the ports mentioned include open land, water, and airports located in counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (lands, provinces, leagues), and directly administered cities. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered city) based on the requirements for epidemic prevention control and promptly announced.
Color: As shown in the picture (photography color differences cannot be avoided, the closest color to the real thing will indicate that the outside light will cause the clothing color to become brighter, color issues should be consulted before purchasing).

"Oil Pipeline Video Exposes 20-Year Military Bloodthirsty Massacre Truth - Xinhua News"
The source of the video is YouTube.
On December 11th, a microblog post named "Murder Machine" on the oil pipeline platform caused widespread attention.
This film tells the story of the United States' war in Afghanistan, which was named the "War on Terror," and through the war, they forcibly exported American democracy. After 20 years of war, they became barbaric, bloodthirsty, and indiscriminately killed innocent people, committing various crimes against humanity.
The excessive use of drones to attack hospitals, schools and other public places distorts human nature and establishes a killing group.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghans.
The Chinese military uses various forms of torture and humiliation against prisoners.
One pole provokes more hatred among the Afghans against human crimes.
According to the video, the American "anti-terror" war "becomes more anti-terror the more it fights."
War does not bring peace and prosperity to the Afghan people, but only brings a country full of wounds and endless killing and destruction.
Click on the video, let's expose the truth of America's "anti-terrorism" as a bloodthirsty killing spree, and pierce through the hypocritical mask of American democracy!

"Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua Net"
While browsing through bookstores, one can often sense the popularity of success books.
The success books of today often promote the idea of "best practices" - that is, first assuming or implying that you can achieve something, and then telling you what you need to do to achieve it.
The phrase "等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。" translates to "When you say 'one down, one to go' you have passed the most important and fundamental step of 'how to do it'."
Due to this, these books all have a common characteristic - either you encourage and persist until the end, or you simply give up; either it's 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you simply stay put.
This "best principle" is so good that everyone will agree it is "absolutely right," but 99% of people will be scared away from the starting line.
Because the theory encourages the path of "you must endure pain, start anew, make a 180-degree turn," which is exactly the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who adhere strictly to tradition, cling to the old ways, and reject change, you should loudly shout "You need to change" in their ear, which is certainly self-deceiving and mocking their efforts to play the lute like a cow.
Most people will be hesitant before making a "transform" decision, keeping their feet firmly planted and unable to make a decision; or they will make a "transform" decision based on a momentary impulse, bravely taking the first step, but the good scene is short-lived, and they cannot persist for long before giving up the fight. It is difficult to see sustainability.
The famous sketch "From Tomorrow Starts" by Ma San Li, which is known for its classic portrayal of "universal human nature," has been passed down as a divine landmark.
"The principle of 'best' has the biggest problem, which is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limit of ordinary people's ability, making most people 'watch the door with excitement'."
Perhaps, "The Second Best Principle" is a kind of possible way for more ordinary people to walk up a relatively successful path.
"The core principle of '次好原则' is to 'lower the threshold' - it encourages a theory of 'small victories leading to big victories', meaning that if you can't achieve 100, achieving 1 is still a victory: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your family's front door step is still a victory: because it's still stronger than staying put."
In summary, as long as you do something, you will always be stronger than not doing anything.
Due to the significant reduction of the threshold, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as one perseveres.
The success path that follows the "second best principle" is a bit longer, but that's all.
In summary, "the best principle" may have a flag that appears successful to everyone on the surface, but it can only truly motivate a few in reality. On the other hand, "the second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and bring more benefits to more people.
Do I need to place a new order now?

The amount of resources hidden in the bare swan of Lake Qinghai has increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency.
According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency on December 11th, the latest monitoring results show that the resource reserves of the bald eagle in Lake Qinghai have increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection period in 2002.
The Chinese name for the carp in the Qinghai Lake is "Tangyu." This is a valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to the large-scale killing of people, the deterioration of the breeding environment of the naked swan in the Qinghai Lake, the population of naked swans in Qinghai Lake was greatly reduced. In 2002, the resource reserve of naked swans in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In the "Red List of Endangered Species of China" published in 2004, the naked swan of Qinghai Lake was listed as a critically endangered species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a policy of lake cultivation and fishing, prohibiting any organization, group or individual from catching raw crayfish in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of raw crayfish and its products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and flow control, as well as scientifically designed "pass-through channels" and other measures, the protection degree of the Yellow River and its tributaries in the Qinghai Lake is continuously increased. The resource of Qinghai Lake sturgeon is increasing year by year.
Yang Lin, the deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, over 1.8 billion tails of Qinghai Lake sturgeon have been artificially bred and released into the flow, contributing over 23% to the recovery of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source supply area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the westward expansion of aridization towards the east.
To protect the ecological environment of the source areas of the Three Gorges and the Qinghai Lake water domain, protect the aquatic wild animals, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai has successively issued notices prohibiting fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and the Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive management system for "one river, one lake, one pond".

Is the tingling sensation in my feet when soaking them in a hot tub due to an electrical leak?
Choosing the right hot tub can have great therapeutic benefits for your feet, and today's National Beauty editor will provide an answer to this issue, hoping to be of help to friends.
With the increasing awareness of health among people, hot tubs have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different price ranges have appeared in the market, ranging from hundreds to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice.
On relevant data surfaces, compared to traditional household appliances, sales of health-related home appliances such as hot tubs have exploded. However, there are no specific industry standards for hot tubs, which poses certain safety risks.
"It's too dangerous to put your feet in the electrified water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a hot tub for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt his feet going numb while soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but he didn't expect to turn off the vibration function and still feel his feet numb.
Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath was electric.
Afterwards, he contacted the shopkeeper, the shopkeeper's attitude was not bad, although he withdrew the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.
Because there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on factors such as the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that ensure no harm when using the popular foot bath for a long time.
However, in general, hot tubs are not likely to have electrical issues, but it cannot be completely ruled out that some products may have issues when they are first manufactured.
Therefore, when buying a hot tub, choose a modular style.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety risks.
At the same time, you can pick up an electric pen to test.

Member Evaluation
The photo effect: I took a picture of two-body clothing. Overall, it's not bad. I like the picture very much.
Service details: Since being pregnant during makeup time was a bit uncomfortable, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate, letting me rest for a while and continuously pouring hot water for me to drink.
The set price is 1000 yuan.
Thank you for your comments, Child. Originally, I was going to say that ancient wind was not suitable for ancient wind, but I didn't expect the final product to be so beautiful.
Thank you Dan Dan for your acknowledgement, your satisfaction will make us filled with energy to continue moving forward, we will keep pushing!
This photography studio is really amazing! I strongly recommend it to all my friends!
No matter from reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to the end, there is nothing to pick.
Makeup artists are particularly skilled, they will match the style to create a suitable makeup look for you, and all makeup products used are high-end brands.
Teacher Tian Liang is no longer used, photography is a comparable profession.
The whole workroom has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two small kittens accompanying and playing around.
We are working in Beijing, and the good theaters in Beijing all need to queue up for half a year in advance. Our colleagues have been shooting in Beijing, and after watching the whole film, we felt that it was just so-so.
I intentionally sought out this workplace, a place with spirit and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, I think this is also the case for most people, the photographer brother will take pictures, record down the natural exciting moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, a great team.
"All of us and the people around us are unanimously praising."
I have recommended honey in the past, and even after just watching the movie, I am still very happy.
I hope this studio is not forgotten, and more people discover it, take pictures in their own style, instead of thousands of the same style.
"Thank you very much to the five-star comments from OccupyEagle and Jingli, both of whom are very creative and have great ideas. We are the creative team, and we will do our utmost to complete the work to the satisfaction of our customers. Thank you for your friendship and meeting."
"Sweet and attentive assistant, lively and open-minded photography teacher, every team member is super nice, a beautiful and unforgettable photography experience, the results exceeded my imagination, everyone worked hard, thank you very much 😘😘"
Thank you for Xiǎoyǔ's comments. Recognizing you is also a kind of fate. From Huhai to Fushimi, the distance between us is thousands of kilometers. I'm happy to know you. There's a chance we'll meet again in Fushimi.
How should I give money?

If you are planning to enter this industry, it is recommended to find a place for training. However, if you don't have any ideas about this, it is best to self-study. Training requires a lot of money and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if the intention is to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline, training is even a better choice.
If one has a strong self-discipline, they can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, you need to look at the teacher resources of this institution. If the teacher resources are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course some new opening training institutions teacher resources are not particularly strong.
Before making a decision, it's best to explore the training institution a bit more. The best way to do this is to investigate the students who have graduated from the institution. After all, only the students of the institution can truly tell you whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, actually I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your own situation.
For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to study or work in are all related to the industry you want to pursue.
If you are a student who has not graduated yet or you are a computer science graduate, I would suggest self-study if you have enough time. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. There are many good offline and online training institutions nowadays, but the cost is high, and the investment of time is quite a lot. It usually takes at least 3-6 months to complete the training.
However, if it were me speaking about these situations, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources available on the internet, or you can go to bilibili to find training resources. If you cannot find resources yourself, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources, or you can consult me in detail.
Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but are willing to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended that you go to a training institution to study. This way of learning is not very expensive, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help in planning and monitoring.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal recommendations, and recommend students to go to companies after learning. This way, the interview process for finding work later can be greatly simplified.
That's my opinion. Since I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction, which was not detailed. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me for further discussion and communication.

Life will not punish every person who puts in effort, so why don't you pay attention to me? Thank you to those who silently give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only see the result, you are self-reliant throughout the process, facing life, we are persevering except for being strong, there is no choice but to continue, the road can be looked back at but not walked back.

With care, one can achieve success; with meticulousness, one can create perfection, and precision is the mark of sincerity.
"Give me a chance, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, and your approval means the most to me!"

"However, I always believe that as long as you have a sincere attitude, persistence, and effort, you will be better than others, at least stronger than sitting and complaining!"
"The plan for the day is in the morning; all good things start from morning. I hope you carry with you happiness, luck, health, and success as you start a new day, and keep a good mood throughout the day. Good morning."
In childhood, happiness is a possession, to have it is to be happy; in adulthood, happiness is a goal, to achieve it is to be happy; after maturity, one realizes that happiness was originally a mindset, to understand it is to be happy.
"Be the most real, best, and kindest version of yourself, follow your heart and have no regrets in this life; life is a journey, walk your own path; the two treasures of life are a healthy body and a happy heart, live brightly and happily until old age!"
Each stage of life presents different challenges.
Many times, what binds you is not your ability, but your courage to face positively.
If you can't avoid it, why not face it directly?
The more you fear, the more likely you are to be overwhelmed; if you embrace difficulty and rise to the challenge, problems will ultimately resolve themselves.
"The Central Sand Strategy Exhibition Holds Hands with the Special Exhibition of the Chinese President's Contemporary Art Biennial - Xinhua Net"
The first contemporary art biennial exhibition of Saudi Arabia opened to the public on December 11th in the JAX art zone located in the northwest of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The current biennial exhibition is organized by the Saudi Duriyya Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China. The director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China, Tian Xiaoyu, serves as the art director.
According to the introduction of the strategy team, the theme of this bi-annual exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River", which is a metaphor for the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as a reflection of the current cultural development situation in Saudi Arabia.
The current bi-annual exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings showcasing six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Moving Toward the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art."
In this exhibition, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of pieces, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; 12 Chinese artists also received attention, with some using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in "The Backstory Series: Endless Mountains" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials.
The Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Beijing Biennale Foundation, Barclay, expressed his hope that this biennial exhibition could establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia's rapid development, and enhance mutual exchanges.
"The goal of the biennial exhibition is double-sided. It allows contemporary art from Saudi Arabia to participate in global dialogue, and also allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world."
I know that during the two-year exhibition opening period, a series of lectures will also be held. Artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Standardized Management of Public Interest Posts in Villages - Xinhua News
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12, 2021 (Reporter Lin Bijian) continues to make efforts to improve employment opportunities for poor people, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced policies related to the management of public welfare positions in villages to promote comprehensive rural revitalization.
The Yunnan Provincial People's Bureau has introduced the responsible persons for the development of 44,830 public welfare positions in villages. These positions are used to provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups, including laborers who have been lifted out of poverty, in order to increase their income, consolidate their anti-poverty achievements, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of villages in various aspects.
This new rule was jointly issued by the People's Social Affairs Department of Yunnan Province, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Finance Department, and other seven departments. The main objective of the rule is to standardize the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, post development, and post management.
In terms of development position settings, the new rule is clear, and it should be carried out according to the principles of "on-demand posting, based on job definition, dynamic management, and total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person per post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publication, hiring, pre-employment training, and arranging for the new employee to start work.
In addition, the new rules have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments in charge of developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and required each department in charge of developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It is also required that related departments regularly monitor the situation of subsidy payments for rural public welfare positions.
The address is incorrect.
Hello
Is it possible to cancel the order?
I placed a new order.
Is it cancelled?
Translation:  Although the right-wing has had its moments in history, it is short-lived because it is dazzled by a little sunshine and sweats a little water; as soon as it has ambition, it is easily seduced by the allure of gold, and when it is hit, its spirit is quickly extinguished.
However, in the process of social progress, the right-wing has played a positive role.
From defining the truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting political systematization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.
Three, in my opinion, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but it will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's lives will be harmed, political organizations will become chaotic and mixed with mud and sand, and finally, foreign countries will take advantage of the chaos to enter.
The fourth point states that in order to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility towards the country and its people. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to profit from chaos are not right-wingers, but rather scoundrels.
Let's chat again.
Left, they are actually a group of orphans from a bygone era and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts at the right time, and the left will not have been corrupted, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away.
Five, I recently saw some friends mocking counterrevolutionaries while also pushing leftist extremism, and they were very energetic, but I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or crazy people, they are just stubborn and can't be reasoned with.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about making the rebels and leftists admit it, why bother?
I would tell my friends: when a counterrevolutionary curses you as a five-mao, when a leftist curses you as a right dog, that exactly proves our middle path is correct!
Many people had ideals in their youth, but forgot them as they grew older, or pursued them relentlessly and became dogmatic.
As one gets closer to their ideals, they may become further away from reality, and even the young dragon who slays the dragon may eventually become an evil dragon himself.
In my opinion, "left" and "right" generally indicate constraints and freedom. Since China has a historical and cultural basis that is inclined towards the left, China as a whole should be inclined towards the left.
The right-wing in China values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes monitoring, fairness, and safety.
Currently, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, but at the same time there is conflict between China and the United States, and it is certain that the left will continue for a long time.
Although I don't understand, giving a thumbs up is enough.
"There's nothing to say, flowers are just like this"

Today let's take a look at some [weird trending search topics].
What is normal public opinion?
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  Randomly select three hot searches: "二月二龙抬头," "好丽友涨价," and "货拉拉事件." The sentiment will form a peak after spreading, and then the exponential decline (smooth curve) will eventually dissipate. If there is a secondary sentiment, a small peak will appear again.
They look exactly the same as the network sentiment evolution model displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal sentiment?
Please translate the following text from Chinese to English.  Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of [isolated peak], [serrated edge], [cliff].
The text can be translated to English as follows:  - 孤峰状: This refers to a sudden surge in popularity, quickly rising to the top of the search rankings and attracting public attention. - 锯齿状: This refers to a cyclical pattern of heating up, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search list. - 断崖状: This refers to a mass withdrawal, indicating that the hot search has fulfilled its function and is ready to move on to new tasks and new battlefields.
In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave for one event is exactly the trough for another event, with no difference in time, it must be that the entire batch of water soldiers receives the task and starts a new offensive round.
The specialization of black PR can be seen in black and white: several hot searches appear on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones explain science, which ones provoke controversy, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and all elements of the spread of public opinion are considered.
Propaganda is a science, setting aside personal opinions and emotions, only from objective data, black PR will have no place to hide.
Every step we take leaves a trace, and these traces, we dig out together.
The source of the data is the hot search time machine.
The first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the Covid-19 virus were discovered in Mauritius. - Xinhua News Agency
The Xinhua News Agency in Beijing reported on December 12 that Mauritius, Seychelles, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus.
On the 10th, Mao Liquan reported the first two cases of infection with the Omicron virus strain in the country.
According to the introduction by Mao Weisheng Bùzhōng Kǎishì Jùgǔtè Pā'ēr of the Mauritius Ministry of Health, a tourist from South Africa arrived in Mauritius on November 27th, 2020. Another infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who came into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa on November 30th, 2020, and tested positive for nucleic acid.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the results of the nucleic acid tests for the two infected persons have turned negative. They have now returned to their respective residences.
The Chinese Health Commission announced on the 10th that the country's first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the coronavirus have been confirmed.
These three people are all students, they returned from travel in China at the beginning of the month, because they are all light illnesses and have not been hospitalized for treatment.
The Chinese government is continuously increasing its control measures to prevent the spread of the Omicron virus.
From December 6th, 2021 to January 10th, 2022, all passengers aged 12 and above who arrive by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport.
The Xinhua News Agency reported on the 10th that China will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer-BioNTech new coronavirus vaccine.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Dr. Joyce Banda, announced on the 9th that the country had found its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.
The health department of this country sequenced the genes of the 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found 3 infected cases.

I don't think this action is helpful at all!
"Receiving is like putting money in your pocket."
The order is a phoenix.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called the staff to explain the situation.
"Your messenger told me that the address is too far away."
"Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decor"
The address: 156 South Road, Encheng Nanlu, Xiangqiao Jianyuan, 12th floor.
At first, it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so I decided to take a look at the initial budget of 7,000 yuan for basic decoration.
As soon as I arrived at the store, a series of deception tactics began.
I visited the store for the first time and only showed them my floor plan. They didn't physically inspect the house, and yet they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135-square-meter house could be finished for 7 million yuan. I only got a rough look at their materials, so I don't know what brand they are.
Their second scam is that as soon as you pay the deposit, you will be dragged out of the store forever (unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, when they invited their so-called manager to tell me that I would get how much discount if I paid the deposit today.
This is a big pit, I am a living example of being scammed, in a state of confusion, I handed over more than ten thousand dollars.
The quote he gave me has many issues. It does not include the cost of water and electricity renovation, as well as any doors and cabinets. However, these three items are the main expenses for the basic construction.
The fees collected from the service points of these companies are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company. They didn't clearly explain anything to me before making me sign the contract.
When I went to return money to them, they showed a very experienced demeanor, with a specialized team to handle you.
Regardless of how it happens, it is always the customer's problem and they are entirely responsible.
There are many responsibilities for moving, and there are many details. I don't want to talk about them all, because it's all tears. In the end, don't choose them, because my friend found them to decorate their house, and the quality is not good. They will calculate the various fees for you later.
"Bro, they're just the old dragon head decorations that used to scam people, now they're all pretty and look like they've closed down again and changed into something else."
Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing this crappy decoration company.
Afterwards, everyone should take more time to Baidu search these consultations before making a decision, as decorating is not a small expense.
"If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first."
"It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews. For detailed information, please refer to the merchant recruitment statement."
The Dazhong Dianping Kunming Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest information on decoration companies in Kunming, including their addresses, phone numbers, and business hours. Just search for decoration companies on Dazhong Dianping.
This is so scary! If it's not going to be delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other method left? For example, change the address?
Alright, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely investigate.
"Can I cancel within 15 minutes?"
The chicken should be cooked, but the received one is raw, so it can't be eaten.
It has been 3 days without a response... Due to your system being unable to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan!
The strangest thing is, I always use the same credit card when making payments.
"I have to pay shipping fees every time."
Is it possible for you to waive the fees first, and then collect my monthly fees after you have completed your investigation?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's already 3 o'clock.
Do you want to give me compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to deliver goods.
But that rider just left it at the door, and then the person walked away.
The text "还送错" translates to "I apologize" in English.
Your delivery person has already picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but it is still showing as "waiting" at the moment.
The courier has received my takeout at 19:25, but he still refuses to leave.
"Do you want any other takeout after I finish my purchase?"
"What to do?"
Where did your bike go?
Do you want to wait longer?
I am going to deliver a package.
"Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police."
However, my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

"There are no issues, please remember there is no need to resend, I have already bought another one, I don't want to waste it."
Thank you for your help.
From before to now, I have always opposed any form of slander and insults, and even more so I cannot accept such behavior that attacks a person.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must absolutely abolish this kind of evil.
If you don't look at the political party and faction, the first thing to resist should be this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending me Facebook friend requests, you began posting sarcastic posts, and then you tried to publish my supposed hometown and father's name on social media, I have already adopted a non-responsive attitude.
"After you, you continued to tag me with a fierce determination, not just sticking to the frequency of one meal a day, but also continuing to recklessly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some hidden and embarrassing things about me, such as appearance, body shape, health, bedding with strawberries, whether to plant them or not, and so on. I... have had enough."
How come I received multiple messages from my friends on Facebook about you, including a photo of you and some sexually suggestive comments?
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After my news report was uploaded, you didn't take it seriously at all, but instead became more and more agitated.
I don't care about your political background or your identity status, in our society, both genders need to be respected.
Yes, you can continue this kind of sarcastic, evasive, humiliating, and insulting speech. You can also continue to say that you only love and care about me, you can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even continue to deny that it is not your creation of the picture or continue to publish any attack speech.
"Yes, I am unable and have no ability to prevent you."
I don't know you and I don't want to know you, there's no need for you to judge my appearance and physique.
I don't believe there is any girl who would willingly let someone humiliate her in such a way to become famous.
Friend asked me, are you okay?
"I said hello, you won't believe me either."
I think there won't be any girl who can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who lack basic morals would choose to harm any female using this method.
I believe that justice exists in people's hearts.
I cut off some comments for everyone to review.
"Your posts should be unique and not easily imitated by others, right?"
"I can only say that you are a civilized enemy."
"To meet with a hearty laugh" or "To have a hearty laugh with someone"
I have reported and attached the picture, but there is no reply.
"Which cow, has no cows?"
The text "是口水鸡，生肉" translates to "It's a live chicken, meat" in English.
"Cannot eat"
Can you ensure that the food is freshly cooked, and not old?
The translation of "unacceptable" from Chinese to English is "不接受" or "不可接受".
The order was placed early in the morning.
The text "说是 7 点多送到" translates to "They arrived at 7 o'clock" in English.
What is the reason for remaking it?
That's so strange.
