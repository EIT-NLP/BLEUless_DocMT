 [/INST] "The core principle of '次好原则' is to 'lower the threshold' - it encourages a theory of 'small victories leading to big victories', meaning that if you can't achieve 100, achieving 1 is still a victory: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your family's front door step is still a victory: because it's still stronger than staying put."

[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。

 [/INST] Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12, 2021 (Reporter Lin Bijian) continues to make efforts to improve employment opportunities for poor people, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently introduced policies related to the management of public welfare positions in villages to promote comprehensive rural revitalization.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。

 [/INST] The Yunnan Provincial People's Bureau has introduced the responsible persons for the development of 44,830 public welfare positions in villages. These positions are used to provide employment opportunities for disadvantaged groups, including laborers who have been lifted out of poverty, in order to increase their income, consolidate their anti-poverty achievements, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of villages in various aspects.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。

 [/INST] This new rule was jointly issued by the People's Social Affairs Department of Yunnan Province, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Finance Department, and other seven departments. The main objective of the rule is to standardize the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, post development, and post management.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。

 [/INST] In terms of development position settings, the new rule is clear, and it should be carried out according to the principles of "on-demand posting, based on job definition, dynamic management, and total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person per post, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

 [/INST] The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publication, hiring, pre-employment training, and arranging for the new employee to start work.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

 [/INST] In addition, the new rules have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments in charge of developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and required each department in charge of developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It is also required that related departments regularly monitor the situation of subsidy payments for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。

 [/INST] Translation:

Although the right-wing has had its moments in history, it is short-lived because it is dazzled by a little sunshine and sweats a little water; as soon as it has ambition, it is easily seduced by the allure of gold, and when it is hit, its spirit is quickly extinguished.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

 [/INST] However, in the process of social progress, the right-wing has played a positive role.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

 [/INST] From defining the truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting political systematization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。

 [/INST] Three, in my opinion, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。

 [/INST] However, I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, but it will inevitably lead to social turmoil, people's lives will be harmed, political organizations will become chaotic and mixed with mud and sand, and finally, foreign countries will take advantage of the chaos to enter.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

 [/INST] The fourth point states that in order to change or improve China, one must have patience and a sense of responsibility towards the country and its people. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to profit from chaos are not right-wingers, but rather scoundrels.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。

 [/INST] Left, they are actually a group of orphans from a bygone era and politics.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！

 [/INST] If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts at the right time, and the left will not have been corrupted, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away.

五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。

 [/INST] Five, I recently saw some friends mocking counterrevolutionaries while also pushing leftist extremism, and they were very energetic, but I think it's unnecessary.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。

 [/INST] In my opinion, "left" and "right" generally indicate constraints and freedom. Since China has a historical and cultural basis that is inclined towards the left, China as a whole should be inclined towards the left.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。

 [/INST] The right-wing in China values freedom, efficiency, and development, while the left-wing emphasizes monitoring, fairness, and safety.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

 [/INST] The text can be translated to English as follows:

- 孤峰状: This refers to a sudden surge in popularity, quickly rising to the top of the search rankings and attracting public attention.
- 锯齿状: This refers to a cyclical pattern of heating up, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search list.
- 断崖状: This refers to a mass withdrawal, indicating that the hot search has fulfilled its function and is ready to move on to new tasks and new battlefields.

 [/INST] The specialization of black PR can be seen in black and white: several hot searches appear on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones explain science, which ones provoke controversy, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, and all elements of the spread of public opinion are considered.
