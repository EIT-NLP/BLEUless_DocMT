The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am #PRS\_ORG# large customer and therefore it is not a problem for me.
I only need a number or instruction on how to package the item so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I have ordered the #PRS\_ORG# for a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
To be honest, I find it very annoying.
Must I cancel the order and reorder for a better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I also think it's good for big siblings to take care of the little ones to some extent.
Looking briefly, helping briefly, bringing the bottle, etc.
Learn responsibility, help at home, and be involved.
As long as they can still take care of themselves, I see no problem.
If your K1 is occupied for a short time and it's okay for him, that's fine.
You can best measure whether it fits for your children.
It's not the case that he should unravel K2 and accompany it for hours while falling asleep.
In terms of law, it is likely questionable.
Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement is also relevant.
If something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Of course, if you're willing to take on the risk, that's entirely up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago, and although I can still recall almost the entire plot, the title eludes me completely. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going to his raptors' enclosure.
The case will be taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, discovers that the therapist in question operates a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety.
The commissioner has a little niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is a new protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of a suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet.
At any rate, it eventually becomes clear that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where patients have a chip implanted that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain and the patients are ultimately forced to confront their fears to the extreme.
A woman jumps out of the window, another one intentionally walks to her death.
This is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire.
That's the basic plot, and I'm pretty sure the book was written by a French author/authoress.
If this story is familiar to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh well, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
Must contact my husband.
However, that can take a while.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter unter dem Daumennagel
Kind, four years, has splinters of wood under the fingernail (outside) on the entire length.
Have tried to remove him with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work out and it caused harm.
The child reacts hysterically when we try to approach it.
No chance left.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson will accelerate the booster campaign
Always new Omikron cases are causing politics and science in Great Britain.
Adults in England should therefore receive a qualifying vaccination offer for the new year.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson intends to progress with COVID-19 booster vaccinations faster than previously planned due to rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens on Sunday evening.
Until now, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns even in the constituent countries of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
A man stands before the Omikron variant in the face of an emergency, therefore it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccine protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protective level could be increased with a third vaccination dose.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to yesterday, there was a significant increase of 65 percent. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am in favor of everyone using pronouns.
I have sent in an application.
Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email.
I will reply to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have googled him/her and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes.
Conclusion: Everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had a noticeable lack of appeal when it came to selling.
How can such a cushion damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS\_ORG#.
However, it works already for about  (Note: "funktioniert" is the German word for "works" and "ca." is an abbreviation for "circa," meaning "approximately.")
4 days left.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# but wanted to buy 8.
However, there was none left.
Now they are available again, and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.

Content warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in detail here.
I just need to write something about the soul.
I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more frequently for professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them.
I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
Even in a private conversation with the perpetrator, far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving one's familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from it.
As I always want to make clear to everyone, it is partly very close to tears, but all of them are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to endure violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
However, it will never be easier.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so unbelievably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What use is the series to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing design: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim
At least for youngster Johannes Patrick, there was hope.
Nothing again: For the second time within barely three months, the giants in Crailsheim have been lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomach."
She did not lie down after the game, but rather intensified due to the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
However, more than just the bare result was disappointing in terms of the way the performance was carried out.
Let's assume a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quote amounted to just 13 percent, 4 goals (all scored by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any more questions?
John Patrick's answer was: "We weren't concentrated enough after our victory at Teneriffa and didn't implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, moving the ball.
Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently from his counterpart: "What a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like in front of 10,000 people.
Meanwhile, on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their own expense.
Not only because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led his team's play.
Gleim praised the best player he had ever trained, saying "Der beste Spielmacher, den ich je trainiert haben".
During Patrick's team, the high performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points after being behind 39:59.
Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Unfortunately, there is no text to translate from German to English. Please provide the text you would like me to translate.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM), the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, followed by a game in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered several months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves and therefore contacted them again.
We originally registered ourselves about half a year ago.
Just as peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59.
He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good morning, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Actually, Max Raabe should have celebrated his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
However, nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been moved to May 2022 - "on official order" to suppress the Corona virus.
Other planned appearances during the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (<http://www.palast-orchester.de>).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up for the already postponed 2020 dates due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has already sung a lot as a teenager.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the Baron has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chanson songs in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has succeeded in moving from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with neatly combed blonde hair and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene cannot be ignored.
With the program "Good morning, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance?

It still doesn't work. I can only shuffle the cover sheet but not flip the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment  Translation:  Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: Through expropriation, no new apartment is created.
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has expressed herself against the expropriation of large residential complexes as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
According to Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday), "with expropriation, not a single new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure."
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix, such as private rentals, cooperatives, or housing companies, is actually the best protection against monopolization.
In Berlin will the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party establish an expert commission to deal with how to handle the result of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent cap.
I will speak with the Minister of Justice to implement it as soon as possible.
If the rental market does not calm down, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes swept through the United States.
Aline in Kentucky could have more than 100 deaths to report.
The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On the night of Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the United States and possibly up to a hundred fatalities.
The storms leave behind a roughly 320 kilometer long trail of destruction, particularly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had raged, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is possible at all.
He calculates only in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that the window #NAME# is sold out.
That is very unfortunate.
Is it still produced?

If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, I can only order the cover now and have it shipped to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return request and wanted to inquire if it had arrived or was being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial bonuses for getting vaccinated.
In order to be in line with the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination, they are.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls, modeled after the German approach, is intended to increase willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations.
He has switched companies over which he complained.

You may also.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares.
He didn't find his job good either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation.
That would then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign  Translation: Help with first own campaign
Hello!
I am currently guiding a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Griffin's Pass" and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big book is done, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been devised, and now I am in the process of writing the starting adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes need to transport a wagon of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further action will develop there.
A few miles from the village, a group of goblins will ambush the hero and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers armed.
Unnoticed, the goblins are waiting for the heroes in a narrow alley and are armed with bows on both sides of the wagon, while two others are stopping the wagon with spears.
If the battle comes and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes will all be unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf.
Of course the cart is gone.
2. If an unavoidable defeat is imminent, this half-elf intervenes with two of his knights and helps the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you justify the use of Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into the adventure?
The group Goblins will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take note of many of your ideas and now also have more trust in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And again stuck together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send it back.
Can you then allow the receipts to be returned, so that I can package the lamp and bring it to the #PRS\_ORG#?

I am bored with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season the quality on the German Sky has decreased so much that I want to take a little breath with this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 reporting on time.
Although the delayed start and the initial delay put the schedule far behind schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision!
It seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice.
Despite being dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race.
Nonetheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a lack of regulation knowledge among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that under a red flag, tire changes are allowed.
Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both parties only came to the decision that Verstappen could change his tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that this opportunity existed for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 at a pay-TV station.
It is not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed by rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, Roos' artificial commenting style does not appeal to me, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, I think Heiko Wasser from RTL is better.
There are constant idiocies that simply look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The latest one brings total chaos to the comment, which apparently does not take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky. In the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV after the race, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is available directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
Both of these broadcasters make less advertising in their training than Sky, and that as a free-TV broadcaster.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the drawbacks.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit the F1.
Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising.
At least the great F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and hasn't been delivered yet.
I have contacted the chat twice so far and nothing has happened.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 19.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front part of the chair).
Please provide support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system through an air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can see the services in comparison there.
If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire facilities with them.
If you have a large aquarium, it is recommended to use pumps with 2 or more outlets so that more water outlets can be connected.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model, but a blower pump can also be offered to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar to name.
The MK-series has a special, sound-insulated construction, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The blower impeller is connected via an air hose 4/6 mm to a throttle valve or the like...and it can start.
The exhaust fan should be, or higher than the water level, and mounted externally.
If the blower fan is lower than the water level, you should insert a check valve between them.
Simply cut through the air hose and insert the ventil in between.
This would prevent it from happening if water flowed backwards, so that the water from the pool would not flow through the pump...
If the blower fan is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packs that consume little energy.
Even though we state the processing time as 3 days on eBay, packages are packed daily and packages are also collected daily here.
Everything is running smoothly while on the go, it's going very fast.
We just want to take a step back so that no one gets upset, just because it took a little longer.
It would be like that, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in logistics...of course, here Corona doesn't stop either.
Please don't rate me negatively just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people naturally complain about these services, even when we say...they have it pretty tough right now.
This is also regionally very different.
Be kind to no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times ahead.
How long does it take to order with and without armrests?
Can you also dye the legs in a bright color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers embarked on a short space trip.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the roughly ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly knighted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue jumpsuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers one after the other climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were traveling for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space travel engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each passenger paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded her after the short flight of the mission of her father.
He had to work hard and do everything himself in his missions.
She was just simply flown along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automatically.
The capsule that detached during the flight of the rocket reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, briefly experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: At the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous worldwide for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was present, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of primarily pursuing the business of space tourism without significant scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without considering the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or cycle through its entire color palette.
Replaced by color change, the glowing stone maintains a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp is weatherproof and can be used outdoors all year round.
In a snowy environment, its light even shines particularly well - one can only count on a shortened light duration, as the days become shorter.
Please pay attention in the winter only to the fact that no snow impairs the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the ongoing Mignon (AA)-format that can be easily swapped out as needed.
You can purchase an appropriate replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the usage duration of your device.

Someone who works or studies in biochemistry.
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and I find the subject itself quite exciting, and in the lab, it doesn't bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies. At that time, I also thought that I would definitely study until I obtain my doctorate and will do so.
Currently, doubts are coming to me, particularly depressing me in terms of career prospects.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears great career prospects and the profession being highly sought after, on the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
What are you working on currently?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What have you studied/ Which training have you completed?
Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering abandoning my studies in 2022 and pursuing a career as a computer specialist instead.
If you have any experiences, please share them as well :)
Extra stress during holiday and public holiday weekends.
This topic came up last week with me.
I must now use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore, now a post is added.
Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas, is there a lot of stress in our operation.
As it appears, there are also sales before holidays and bridge days.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt".
On Friday, most people and businesses observe a semi-official bridge day.
Last week, there was also a long 4-day weekend at home.
What was going on last week?
Stress is everywhere.
Must-read emails that need to be addressed before departure, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
If... yes, why?
"If 'next week then' sounds so long after so much time and that's not allowed?"
Or is it because people want to accomplish so much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also very angry.
What is the reason for this self-isolation due to holidays?
What's the point of having holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent and self-sufficient.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical style?
Or do you know that in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She would agree to the party by baking and frying with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the sensible days, she still has a lot to do: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, I have to get started now."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moulting and feather regeneration.
NETON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kilogram.
NECTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage.
The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage.
For a functioning metabolism, daily nutrition must contain adequate vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein supply and/or inadequate provision of vitamins and minerals.
When composing NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NECTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or through the feed.
Thank you, I found it.

According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape, they were only too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is to fulfill their purpose.
For me, they are not flat.

Residential house fire with two lightly injured and significant damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, a respected damage in the six-figure euro range has been incurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire seems to have spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with mild smoke poisoning on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
However, it comes much later.
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo  Translation:  To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
The CEO of BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has not publicly stated his vaccination status so far.
The entrepreneur published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend moved him to share this information with Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
For several months, my friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract false rumors.
So far, he has rejected it because communication should not revolve around him.
However, a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
According to Şahin, the school friend and his family have not been vaccinated.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts alone, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the internet, there is a circulating interview with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says that he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at that time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for vaccination.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly received the vaccine three times according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases probably also no heating.
A transformer had tripped at a substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
Through the fire on Friday evening, at 41,000 affected residents in several communities, the lights went out.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency power generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disturbance could be fully resolved by the late evening.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered support places in schools and called for neighborly help.
The supplier bowed to the affected individuals for their patience and to the helpers for their effort.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring effort, said the head of the department of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will still take some days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily put some cables back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company statements.
Electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 pm according to Westnetz's information has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the transformer station Neunkirchen-Seelscheid.
There are extensive cleaning and repair work required there.
Parallel to that, an attachment to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday 6 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 9:30 PM.
Since 23:15 hours, even the last affected individuals had power.
Over 80 engineers from Westnetz and partner companies have been deployed.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday.
It is important now that citizens take care of older or lonely people in their neighborhood and inform the local fire stations when help is needed, explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
Furthermore, temporary care places were set up in schools by the authorities for those people who could not care for themselves or require power-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the tickets in Germany are sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It concerns the daily agenda #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you are also having a nice day and stay healthy ♡
But I can't mount it on the tabletop.

Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the intended purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback.
That is really simpler!

Could you please send me the return shipping label via email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I did not restart the E#PRS\_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find such a small font almost insulting.

In order for the color application to be even and clean, you should clean the parts with soap and water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse them with clean water, and dry them thoroughly.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the inside of components that are no longer visible or on a yogurt cup.

Apply the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Overlapping of the color layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back and forth wiping with the brush.
Through this process, unrealistic-looking areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine later.
Metal tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate paintbrush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal streaks can occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve a realistic appearance through decals or removable images.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names, from trim strips and license plates on automobiles: Decals give the model the final polish.
Bring the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible.
In the cockpit of an aircraft, it can be mounted or more easily affixed before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as a knife, tweezers, and toothpick are when gluing, patience and a steady hand.
Cut each required decal individually and arrange them neatly.
Decals are also called water-shedding decals because you moisten their reverse side with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the moisture.
Then you just paste a small piece of the paper onto the model in the corresponding place (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check whether the picture is sitting correctly before you completely peel it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, fray or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only briefly open a book when I'm looking for something else, then I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the page where I left off.

Childbirth treatment with health insurance / What is a "insurance case"?  Translation:  Childbirth treatment with health insurance / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were for some time in child welfare treatment, now when it comes to billing with the statutory health insurance, this suddenly stands in the way.
According to:
We had applied for the in vitro fertilization procedure in advance at the PKV and received the approval for up to three attempts.
The experiments were not in any way limited (e.g. in terms of time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was credited to the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and underwent 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not include these in our PKV calculations.
We requested again the cost assumption by the PKV and were granted again 3 more attempts.
After some further attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, logically the most expensive ones should be replaced with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to replace 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first offer fall away.
The second child wish is a new insurance issue.
According to Section AGB, "The insurance event begins with the treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
Who has the right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are replaced) or us (we have to replace 5 attempts)?
If the PKV had pointed out in the contract that with a birth, further attempts would fall?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance risk?
The infertility (caused by closed tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
Okay.
We will no longer order from them.
If they add up the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They are welcome to pass it on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated, but now you are telling me that I need to send the thing back first.
I can't really do anything about it that the wardrobe is completely messed up when it arrives at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
It is clear and distinct that the repayment was initiated and I have not yet received a repayment per #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Previously, they were not allowed to sell him as an office chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, I am not able to produce a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cupboard and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS\_ORG# series.

"Halber Sieg" against Belarus with high costs for the EU  Translation: A "Halber Sieg" against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU.
According to Raphael Bossong, a political expert, the EU can declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
However, the costs are very high and represent significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, according to Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher from the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of suspension - Belarus doesn't give up entirely, but the EU feels like the winner - it probably goes on for a while longer.
According to Bossong, the treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole does not take a stance against it, this is at the expense of basic rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union.
She seems to be unable to prevail when a member state insists on doing things its own way, as is currently the case with Poland, which even denies access to the EU's border protection agency Frontex at the border.
In addition, the EU imposes another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border
According to statements by Poland's border guard, migrants have nevertheless attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus.
Five migrants were taken into custody on Sunday night and brought back to the border on Sunday, a spokesperson for the authorities said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly thrown with stones by migrants near the village of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border restrictions.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months or attempted to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being a ruler in Minsk, luring him with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners travel to countries of origin to prevent departures.
According to Bossong, the most effective element of the EU's response was the pressure on the airlines.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures.
Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly checks thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale.
Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race according to Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The silver arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, where he allegedly made an illegal overtake.
A second appeal was filed against the assessment at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' perspective, the protocol was not followed in a rule-compliant manner.
Translation: Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and had celebrated his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, in which the Dutch driver in front of him had been overtaken.
I am checking it.

But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it be completely.
Oh wow, then you're just as unserious as Kollegah.
If someone seriously questions the basic principles of evolution, they are simply lost.
For my part, I believe that a God has set everything in motion.
But as soon as you become a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense.
And thus, you are a science hater and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the magnifying glass should be brought as close to the eye as possible.
The specifically planachromatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you a practically note- and color-error-free use of the magnifying glass up to the edge zone.
Often, loupes are marked with magnification indications.
These details apply only to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the intended use conditions.
In order to make the most of your loupe, we kindly ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical Data" table (see instruction manual in the packaging).
Reflections occur on the surface of all optical devices, including lens surfaces, as well as at slits.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When used in accordance with optimal usage conditions - with a loupe right in front of the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the accompanying user manual (available in German and English).

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are searching for Christmas trees.
Frank Diers, the farmer, has experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants around 200 of them.
Meanwhile, the 56-year-old has experienced many strange situations.
He says that he always makes the pre-Christmas time a bit funny.
And what about the coupon?
Translation: "I used to be a customer?"  Explanation: The phrase "Sonst bin ich als Kunde weg?" can be translated to "I used to be a customer?" in English. It is a rhetorical question, implying that the speaker used to be a customer but is no longer one.
At least, I have received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "turner," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
Problems with glass fiber and Devolo dLAN/Magic  Please provide the text you would like me to translate from German to English.
We have had a new fiber optic connection at home for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable Wi-Fi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, with a few exceptions, flawlessly received and transmitted 50 Mbit.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receive these.
However, the WiFi module that sends out the WiFi signal no longer receives the full 500, but as I move further away from the module with the module in my house, the signal strength decreases (so use a power strip that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was certainly better than DLan, but there were still significant losses here as well.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line using fiber optics?
And is LAN really the solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to run LAN cable in the house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be even more pleased with a response.

He thought that there would be peace at the giro accounts, but he is disappointed.
While many banks are using the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past to their customers with various tricks, the negative interest rates also continue to fall.
The German Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the betting limit and even quadrupled the daily stake.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division of Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, in the meantime, these lower thresholds apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly reached individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, just like at ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB, which is well-liked by cost-conscious customers, has lowered the interest margins in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now a buffer of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached a limit of 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which were granted legal rights by the first instance court in Berlin against this regulation.
Now, in banks, it is being discussed whether institutes should possibly create reserves - in case the upper instances declare the negative interest rates in principle as unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She stands officially at the top of Hollywood now.
But their life is like a mountain and valley journey.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
Because of their appearance, an entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers is concerned.
At least, so Aniston, allow herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
It's actually a miracle that the hearts of both male and female fans are equally captivated.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still searching for her great love.
And the desire for a baby from the list has been crossed out.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother.
It hurts her.  번역결과   그녀는 고통을 받고 있습니다.
The people who asked don't have a clue what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.

Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Quit  Kimi Räikkönen, the 2007 Formula One World Champion, has announced that he will retire from the sport at the end of the 2021 season. The Finnish driver, who has been racing in Formula One since 2001, has had a successful career with 21 race wins, 18 pole positions, and 103 podium finishes. However, his performance has been declining in recent years, and he has not won a race since the 2018 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.  Räikkönen's decision to retire comes after a difficult season in which he struggled to keep up with his teammate, Charles Leclerc. The Alfa Romeo driver finished the 2021 season in 10th place in the championship, with only one podium finish. Despite his struggles, Räikkönen has been praised for his professionalism and dedication to the sport throughout his career.  Räikkönen's retirement marks the end of an era in Formula One
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a slight contact with the band, Raikkonen had to stop his Alfa Romeo not even halfway through the race at the Grand Prix of Abu Dhabi.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the top class of motorsports.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest success was winning the World Championship in 2007 while driving a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport
The brand of Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen with 94 achievements is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
I have calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, on Saturday, he defended against Johannes Lochner's attack by reducing it by five hundredths by moving from rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove on Sunday with 0.30 seconds a larger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have taken a greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgaden resident John Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, moved up from second place to fifth place this time.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth in the first race after starting fourth.
"If I only knew what he does differently, then I would also do it that way," said Lochner.
Note with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka  Translation:  Note with Home Victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte achieved her third season victory in the two-man bob on her home track.
After failing to qualify for fourth place on Monday in the monobob, she won the German triple on Sunday with Deborah Levi as her pusher.
Two-time bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She achieved besides her Olympic qualification the first podium place in this winter.
The Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool to finish on the first podium in the World Cup. I am super happy that Mariama is coming with me.
I am very happy with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not entirely flawless trips, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay it, so I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had different problems last year and never had the time for it.
And now it was said that he had run out of time, which really annoyed me.
Look at the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I want to return it and then order it again because it's currently on sale.
Therefore, the shipping will only start on March 16th?
There was no information about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
"Wurde gestern von Ihrer Kollegin abgenommen" translates to "Was taken away from you by your colleague yesterday."
Why is it a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered items.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And not the entire order.
Only today, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and women,
I have something I just want to write and maybe it will resonate with someone out there...
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student, and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or goes to kindergarten, he is essentially my child.
My friend (together since 6J) is sick, has a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel that we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) which is dealing with my needs for affection and love.
My dog puppy just has diarrhea, I just cooked for him and now he is relaxing in his cozy bed after I washed him with a warm lamp and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now the homework is also coming to us, which we of course divide among ourselves.
But even cooking is currently a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is currently well-established, I am relatively well-treated and I am on the right track.
Not good, but I'm getting there and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (which is a lot for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room left.
My week is going like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the vacation.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am just so stressed that I need these mental anchors because otherwise, I pack it in.
Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't seem to do anything about it...
Is it going well for you too?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinite gratitude, I can't even begin to express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise.
I think that also has something to do with mental load for women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color and the surface is scratched, and there is a table leg impression.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very excited!!
What can I offer you?
If we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12#NUMBER#.
In the meantime, twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Mal was komplett anderes: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, it has always been something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also talk to work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional matters and it is reasonable to separate them.
Sure, here's the translation:  Also, please provide a curriculum and such.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What brings someone to want to learn about religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserving culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English as I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would avoid it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect promptly, until at the latest the beginning of next week, a feedback.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24).
I believe it is a movie for teenagers.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
For one, modernity (real world).
For another, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any better in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a situation arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can continue to live.
I believe the transition is also the burial site of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If that tells you something, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has slept only on the stomach from week 1.
"Fast forward: lebt noch :D" translates to "Fast forward: still alive :D" in English.

A child holds much more value than one might think.
Ensure that everything around you is in order, no stuffed animals, go out and take a look more often, but no minute surveillance.
That really drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
Asch and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Observe your child while it sleeps.
Can you turn your head to the side?
Can it be stood up from the bottom?
Or is it with the face down on the mattress?

We have all grown up and when my husband came into the world, it was common practice to lay the kids on their stomachs to sleep.

BTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's simply the case that the politics of this station are currently under everyone's nose.
Almost every format is exhausted (ok), but then still go on a big tour.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.

The naturally apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
In Krogmann there is a complete lack of empathy, and instead of taking action with the exploded rented rooms, he tries to create ashes.
How do you find it all good?
It's great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
Please call me back, as my delivered wooden table is defective.

Is the battery dead?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and approximately 3 years old) would no longer charge through my power cord.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought, a power supply unit alone is sufficient for operation.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even with the power cord inserted.
Then I expanded the battery, but here it doesn't work either.
Do you have any ideas?
I have ordered a new battery, but why can't I use my laptop in Wi-Fi mode?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!

With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20 liter storage capacity can also handle larger photo accessories without any problems, as they can be securely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And whatever else you might need for everyday objects, will remain well-organized and separable from the photo equipment, thanks to practical approaches in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look as well.
The minimalist design is legendary - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment.
It works with two options: conventionally through the cover flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a highly thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in Messenger bags.
There is a metal locking pin with matching anchor brackets on the inside of the closure flap of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has taken different "fill levels" into consideration: there are actually 4 riveted anchor bars, into which the locking hook can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, just take the top bar. If it's relatively empty, take a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be closed reliably without using the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other backpacks, such as photo backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
The eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage.
In Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more information below) and thus easily separate both from each other - and through the two side openings, you can also access it independently.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while your everyday items stay safely on the left side of the backpack and don't get in the way.
Basic, easily adjustable harnesses help.
And the outer shell of the backpack is completely made of 100% recyclable, waterproof Nylon, so the contents will stay dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.

Order and payment was on 12/12/21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks at the southern branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and caused the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49 onwards.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were delimited, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels emerged almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, hire workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers also have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, need to manage your resources and set up a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma) to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) and 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood).
In Coloma, there are five rounds in a year.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The bartender turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions by doing so.
This goes on until the prankster has moved five times, covering each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players have to defend Coloma from an angry gang of bandits in a frenzied defense.
When players have enough revolver heroes assigned and the bandits are numerically superior, they receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the cemetery.
When the game ends after the third shootout, then the final scoring takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library
C. psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on child-rearing.
Former patients and legal guardians are now raising serious accusations against him.
Please pay attention to the fact that the film is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
It should never, never, never be allowed for parents or other responsible parties to have power over a child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to create a framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the given situation.
Ugh, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss removal of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals  Translation:  Holetschek: Countries are discussing the removal of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the federal states plan to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We need quick clarity on whether and when vaccinated people can be exempt from testing three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The absence of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive," said Holetschek.
German to English Translation:  Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to propose, "that he will make a suggestion to the Health Ministers Conference on Tuesday." - AFP
I also want to send the lamp back.
How should I proceed best?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat height is.
Can you help me further?
I can't complete any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#.
Display: Oh no, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# website can be done on the computer.
I have updated the account details.
What could be the reason for this?
As you describe it, it is referred to as *Awareness*, which refers to sensory perceptions under anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing sounds/voices, rarely seeing images, and the least often feeling pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as in order to protect the child until birth, a very deep anesthesia is avoided.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the narcolepsy consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex has no awareness by definition.
I have misread their comment.
However, the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20 euros are also not helping us.
Those are statutory warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be that they take back the defective chair.
That is besides the legal obligation also a standard in the area of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take away the broken chair.
We will sell the second chair privately.
We also lose quite a bit of money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to.
The question again.
In the order and on the invoice, it states that the merchandise will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The courier company is #NAME#.
I am currently working there.
One person told me that they only deliver up to the doorstep - due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the second floor.
Why wouldn't I be called?
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There lies the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older".
The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I already testify to my gratitude for life here."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common types of pallets used in Europe is the European pallet, which is a standardized wooden pallet primarily used as a load carrier in the European region.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Statistics Austria, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
As many palettes are imported into Austria annually, it is not levied.

Rolled Meat Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips for the perfect goulash last week.
There was a lot of food at Christmas and it was absolutely delicious and creamy!
And thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time.
In the morning, I will set up a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now?
What about the books? How can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English is not as good anymore, but I'll manage.
The issue is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I have already been informed by email on January 18th that the refund has been made.
However, the money has not yet arrived with me.
Please check that.
Where there is still Christmas roast in Lübeck  Note: Lübeck is a city in northern Germany known for its marzipan and Christmas markets.
For many people, goose or duck belongs to Christmas like the Christmas tree and gifts.
Have you not purchased any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controllers, you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the volume without changing anything in the "Gain" and distortion settings.
Above, it was already mentioned that one can even make a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator, even when it gets unbearably loud.
Thank to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal here is processed with a box simulation, so that you will get an eminent "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
The AUX-socket can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so that you can listen to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you therefore do not need a separate pitch control.
If someone buys an additional VFS5 footswitch, they can comfortably call up sounds using their foot, toggle the effects on and off, and adjust the tempo of the accordingly compatible effects "tap".
For the live deployment, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But that looked different with others.
Can you then send the lamp back to me?
Is it because the table is too low for the dining table?
And I would like to send them back then.
Can you help me further?
And the chest of drawers?
Can we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a voucher or discount.
Due to circumstances, I have found a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for things I don't need, that's a bit much.
I just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# Spiegel (Mirror) on the designated hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran is seeing progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement.
According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was no agreement even on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were continued after a brief interruption of just over a week.
Participants in the negotiations include envoys from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia.
Another US delegation is in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the free state is now the federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has surpassed Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value exceeds the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence of over 1000 on Sunday.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the seven-day incidence rate was 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly decreased, but still exceeded the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, within a day, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill COVID-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals.
During weekends, there may be reporting delays.
Furthermore, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, is that it or not?
Here, I don't need to click/enter/fill anything else?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return shipment at my own expense.
8 euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, an insult.
It's time for changes.
Greetings to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post here for?
If one were to take a look at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one could conclude: it does not exist.
We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
What is the problem?  번역결과   문제는 어디에 있습니까?
Yes, where is it located?
For the most part, it probably has to do with dissatisfaction, how things have gone here and how generally we are struggling.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are really looking forward to the Mbundestag.
As we need to change  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #.  #
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is being asked who wants to keep this alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found a pile of shards.
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have emerged who want to rebuild the project.
However, I would also like to explicitly call upon everyone to participate, only in this way can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.

How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing regulations must be changed / adapted / removed?
How will we appear to the outside world in the future?
How are new members to be recruited?
How do we create a fair voting system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten some things, but that's not too bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let's democratically decide on our future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/gigantic for my taste and not suitable for me.
For that, I have already ordered a different hanging system from you.
I put it together and noticed it then when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this is returned and I receive a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as #NAME# is darker than expected.
I have a question: does the daily schedule #PRS\_ORG# also come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
PRS\_ORG must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly.
And I kindly ask you to do so now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the shelf as much as possible for pickup. They need to clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how that will work.
PRS\_ORG can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have had time to take care of these or to decide on the return shipment?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, eats current
I myself was also previously a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And, well, I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was actually supporting animal cruelty with it.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction was rising on their side, they then defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and as a vegetarian, one could reduce animal suffering.
I am wondering if my answer to "plump" was correct?
How do you answer the question?
The feeling that as a vegan one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without one wanting it.
It greets a vegan woman who loves harmony.
It is not a unique case under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am the assigned date on which #PRS\_ORG# is supposed to collect my return not in person.
As I cannot be present in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed either.
Can you please assign me an alternative pickup time?
Since 01.02.#NUMBER#, I have been consistently meeting again.
The Lahnsteiner defense for water rescue is prepared: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a funding decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for a new device car of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein at Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I'm glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here, says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein.
The equipment truck is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks both on and under water in water and ice rescue as well as in technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently considering increasing operations: The boom of river cruises on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
Despite following their recommendations and synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app, it did not work.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Alright, then.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 Standard, the previously mentioned values in the Fenix Laboratory are determined at 21°C ± 3°C, 50%-80% air humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thank you first of all for doing so, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar role in the public service, specifically as a weapons carrier in the executive branch, let's not go into further details!
I find the question of right and left always oversimplified.
Generally, one should say that naturally the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it is also clear that people in special uniforms and weapon carriers naturally appeal to conservative, magical thinking on the right should also be obvious to everyone that these people then have great difficulty dealing with everyday reality. Of course, it is also clear, because you have, besides the average white person, now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and also on these people I can and must rely, because in the end, they may save your life or set it up for you.
But even these peripheral groups also represent, although it may initially sound strange according to my experience, a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel themselves less understood by exaggerated left-wing politics. They simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, of course, the police and the armed forces are a cross-section of society, so one will also find extreme right-wing views there, but it is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad also start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain like-minded individuals meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nonetheless, such things are effectively combated and countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is also good, in my opinion, that we couldn't possibly have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, if there's something I don't understand, I've also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
As I inquired, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available.
I previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS\_ORG# crate for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or check if the crate is available somewhere in Germany as well.
I always find you as a partner company.
but there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part that are filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch.
Is it ordinary for a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a matter for longer.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (independently, very little free time), but since my whole life I have had trouble maintaining a clean and orderly household on a permanent basis.
There are always phases in which everything stays where it is, and every now and then it catches me and I tidy up and clean.
But it's not really "that someone could spontaneously drop by."
My man is (unfortunately) not better either, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household just loses against work and laziness.
The kitchen is regularly cleaned because we like to cook.
Regarding my question, have you managed to become a decent person?
We don't have any yet, but we're working on it and this question has been on my mind for a longer time.
For me, there is no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as much as long as no visitors come, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Should one provide a greater incentive for children or remain careless?
I am looking forward to your responses.

Career in social work - as someone with a self-unconfident personality disorder?
I have completed an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been employed in the industry for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-assured (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
To put it roughly, that means I have no sense of self-worth and as a result, I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it's very difficult for me to have loose conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as aloof (which I think I've improved on).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual working day is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it pulls me down every time there is something to criticize in my code ("again, even the simplest things are messed up") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do it"/"I'm holding him back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.).
I will likely have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already held onto the sofa?
There was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by "backgeben bitte"?
When I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book not" appears.
Is there a problem?
I was chatting with #PRS\_ORG# and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken up with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids), which it then uses to build its own body proteins, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather regeneration in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the overall organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it can cause disruptions in the breeding process.
Following the modest gift of NEKTON-Bio, daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral substance preparation) should be resumed.

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
In a scooped teaspoon (lying down) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
For severe feather damage at the beginning, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the approach of feather regeneration becomes visible.
After that, the normal dose is measured until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair.
How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged when it arrived and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws  Translation:  Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree will be felled.
Application to the community submitted.
An employee informs me that the pruning of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the lease agreement.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaw.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are unique.
I thank you for your answers.
As we understand it.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Okay, then I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a coupon?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I think the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the roof shipped to Germany.
Can you check that?

Good, then thank you again that it went so easily!
"Rat and ideas for further professional life"
First of all, happy Christmas to you all!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is not very good because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought.
Before I start here, briefly: I need advice and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a beginner.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (at least somewhat anonymously, I don't want to reveal anything more specific).
The whole thing was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Eventually, I ended up at the teaching profession and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that was of no concern to me.
I am now at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it has only been half a year.
Before the paintings, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that, I can still turn around.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now it's vacation time, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my vacation day was my vacation day.
I had it free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that also annoy me.
Generally, it's fun and from an external perspective, the Ref seems to be running well in terms of feedback.
But I am completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had the freedom to take time off when I needed it, and worked together as a team on something, rather than being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now and be unhappy again.
You can tell it's all a bit confusing, but perhaps as outsiders you have some advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation where I am completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions now in an emotional state, that is likely to lead to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me at least a little to see some light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and please excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET-Technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp-schaltungen, the VTX-amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amplifiers also contain, of course, the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This partly relies on genuine analog circuits, as these are better at capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances simply bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and a greater number of improved amplifier models.
From the VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists in search of maximum sound diversity will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the drive and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube-like character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers.
The losing streak series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure parts, it adapts entirely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras.
Of course, what ultimately fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible equipment setup could be a DSLR camera with a telephoto lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flashgun.
Larger DSLR cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 offer more room for additional lenses.
In addition, one can also store a lot of accessories.
And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items.
Even drone pilots find a perfect match with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island since Sunday.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available about previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dare not make a forecast as to when it might end.
The indicators point towards a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to the state TV channel RTVE.
Million-dollar damages
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
Almost 1700 football fields.
More than 700 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land masses were formed by solidified lava with a combined area of approximately 50 hectares.
Particularly hard hit was the immensely important banana cultivation for the island, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly and which was already in crisis mode before the volcanic eruption.
25 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and gifts.
Christmas is at the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive quality due to the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas belongs to one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
So important is it to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "society-binding contract of natural peoples" and thus a peace-promoting act, can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life within the context of this tradition.
As from Nicholas the Christkind was born.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift-giving.
Prior to St. Nicholas Day, gifts were exchanged in some form or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night in order to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional form of giving arose in Germany the popular custom of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants object to this practice because they reject the role of mediators between God and humans as "Holy Worship."
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther turned Saint Nicholas into the Christkind and established a new tradition line with that.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only annoys the fewest that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today, one finds everything from socks to coveted luxury watches at the doorstep and under the Christmas tree, all that one's heart desires.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries.
Sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful confusion about the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind (Christ Child) appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann (Christmas Man), who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus (Santa Claus) with some unique characteristics assigned to him over time.
For example, this includes having a white beard that has little in common with the more strict Assyrian hairstyle of the historical figure, a sleigh pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, goblins bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brings fame.
Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses pulling the sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

I haven't bought another e-book from #PRS_ORG# yet.
I have requested a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# for the past week and this morning.
I was told that something will be sent to me.
Since I have not received any either (not even in the SPAM folder), I would now like to inquire about how long this usually takes.
Thank you very much.
Police shot a suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday, a armed man was shot by the police.
The police reported that callers had informed them of a man who had gone into a bank and a bookkeeper's business with a weapon.
The man fled according to government statements in a vehicle that was stopped by officials shortly thereafter.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the crime scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several messages are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Additional members of the royal family also live there.
What do you mean by "which one"?

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden.
The light is simply placed and can be anchored with 2 earth spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum brightness duration: 10 minutes.
The robust plastic manufacturing is year-round usable in outdoor areas.
In Hollywood speak, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with a colorful aura.
However, "Smart Stone" is different: only the sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a large pebble shaped by nature, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone garden.
He does well even among larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries.
Set the "lightstone" at any preferred, sun-illuminated location.
Two included earth spikes provide a secure hold when needed.
The white plastic shell itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colorful light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
"Smart Stone" automatically starts to light up as dusk approaches; in which color, that's up to you: You have six attractive light colors to choose from - besides daylight white - at your disposal.
The shutdown also occurs automatically when the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it becomes bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I have already done it multiple times, but it doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to order more from you, but if the voucher is not credited, I will not order from principle.
If you think otherwise, please let me know.
Otherwise, today was the last contact.
Then please send me the number for the sideboard as well.
I'm in lockdown, so there's no hardware store open...

Pill problem
Hello beloved women's community,  I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. I wanted to take a moment to share some exciting news with you all. As many of you know, I have been working on a new project for some time now, and I am thrilled to announce that it is finally ready to launch!  The project is called "Women's Voices," and it is a platform dedicated to amplifying the voices of women from all walks of life. Our goal is to create a space where women can share their stories, experiences, and insights with the world, and where they can connect with other like-minded individuals.  We believe that the voices of women have been historically silenced and marginalized, and we are committed to changing that. Our platform will feature a wide range of content, including articles, podcasts, videos, and more, all created by and for women.  We are also excited to announce that we will be hosting a series of virtual events and workshops, where women can come together to learn, grow, and connect. These events will cover a wide range of topics, from self-care and wellness
I hope I'm doing everything correctly, it's actually my first post after a year on reddit.
Regarding my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago mainly because I had such terrible pain during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stay, because I already have to take enough medication that I can't choose for myself due to chronic illnesses.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had during my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100 suddenly got acne all over my body.
As superficial as it was, it still bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel comfortable.
In the two-year pause, nothing really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this again.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without dyes, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor did not take me seriously and I still need a dermatologist appointment.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
The love of the skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread impetigo and the acne topic.
Nutrition, I have also tried everything possible during my Christian illness, and I am still on a mixed diet of sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else worked well.
It can also be the case that hormonal contraceptives just have the worm in them, but if you want to avoid complications, it's better not to look for anything else that might be wrong.
I had already given everything to my colleague's seminar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what the response was to my inquiry.
I have to keep working in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money were there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but there is generally in large  Note: "in groß" can be translated as "in large" or "in general" depending on the context.

10-kV earth cable will be newly built in 2022.
The authorization for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The decision by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now shared the following information.
The approximately seven kilometer long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community with the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a transmission tower near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
My order from January 3, 2021 with the order number #NUMBER# has only come in part to us so far.
The blue delivery number: #PRS\_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is?
A good start to the week!
You can forget about it, I have already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass commode, and all sides are covered with glass, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken.
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
That means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request is made at #PRS\_ORG# since it probably involves a general problem.

I look forward to continuing our journey together.  Best regards, [Your Name]
I have been at Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems with time-efficient planning of my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so I basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an OHP as media.
In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which bothers geography).
I currently need very long to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands on its own.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I also want to invest a reasonable amount of time for simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create an worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would be truly delighted.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible first.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered can enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments sales declines.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations kill the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE) for the retail trade.
When trading in non-daily necessities, losses in turnover should be reported, criticized HDE-Chief Executive Officer Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already finished their Christmas shopping.
As actually the positive peak of the year should be, it is often a hole without a bottom, said Genth.
Retailers with 2G restrictions lost almost a third of their turnover in the past week.
It's only successful in the food retail trade and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G at shopping brings us no further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel effort.
He demanded that the bracelet regulation be approved nationwide.
After that, each customer should only need to be checked for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) once and would have access to all stores with the wristband received on that day.
Furthermore, in retail stores - as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - sample control checks should be sufficient.
Even the real estate company specializing in shopping center properties, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona level, and the revenues at around 90%.
"These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the most important Christmas business," said Wilhelm Wellner, CEO of the "Wirtschaftswoche" to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, attempts will be made to find solutions and obtain approval for the centers.
The so-called "wristband solution" is being considered, where "visitors, for example, would have to present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel - be able to enter all shops unrestricted." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#.
Der Spiegel has a scratch and there is also an error in the frame that was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks unattractive.
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and sealed it.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance construction, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
The color temperature and brightness of the lamp are set by a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A particular feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The light source generates a very high-quality soft light with no flicker.
The illumination angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively short distance is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on the film set or in the studio.
The optional available DMX512 controller enables remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in difficult-to-access places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for the NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery) located there.
User memory The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To execute the settings of individual settings on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the storage keys for a longer period of time and it will be completed.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical in studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
One of the biggest advantages of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting whether the batteries have sufficient performance - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display screens (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power through the included transformer.
The construction of the flashlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm thread for reinforcement, so you can attach it directly to your photo tripod.
The inclination can be reliably established using measuring instruments on both sides.
It was ensured that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a universal joint is included in the delivery.
Great, the delivery also includes a bag.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to purchase without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, that we wanted to spit on": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row winless Hesse seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga relegation.
But then the SGE turned it around, shot itself within an hour of frustration over a disappointing start of the season and won fiercely with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have achieved today," shouted coach Oliver Glasner to DAZN and gave a "blanket compliment" to everyone who was there, saying, "It's insane what the guys have achieved today."
Initially, it looked like another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which was still ranked ninth despite their high expectations.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in a commanding 2:0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result.
Even defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game and overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
I believe our mentality is incredibly great, said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a glance at the result, particularly for the spectators.
That was the party we were going to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but even the players live highly professionally.
Let's proceed "step by step and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
As next, on Wednesday during the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (7:30 PM, Sky) on the schedule.
I will receive the mail that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is placed again?
For me, unfortunately, it would mean that I wouldn't order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after their humiliating defeat against Denmark.
For the conclusion of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection collected a harsh defeat at the 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," concluded national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second place behind the Danish team (10:0).
It is unfortunate that we couldn't take the flow with us.
Captain Emily Bölk said, "That was a bad game we have to erase."
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, there must be a significant improvement on Tuesday against the World Cup runner-up of 2019 to keep the delicate dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
Best female thrower in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was Rückraumspielerin Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor defense," Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We must now look ahead quickly."
From front to back not at the height  번역결과   앞부터 뒤까지 높이에 따라 없음
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at their best at the start of this game.
Mistakes and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at full operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, as Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack.
The hoped-for ignition was not this, however.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make a scene - and if they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in front of the Scandinavian goal.
So the game was prematurely ended at 3:10 after 20 minutes due to a hard foul by Mia Zschocke on her opponent, resulting in Zschocke receiving a red card.
But in the quarterfinals, she can participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection improve and until the break, at least five goals were scored.
The already quiet hope for a comeback after the change was already gone after seven minutes of the 9:19.
The Greens' offspring again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent who counts among the medal candidates at the end.
As a result, the German team was unable to muster a performance improvement and was clearly defeated on the court.
DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season  Translation:  DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Familientraditionen in der Weihnachtszeit  DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season
As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have captured St. Nicholas Day and use it as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions during the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it at home with you then?
How is it with your partner?
Would you also like to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is best for children?
The stiefelputzen?
Plätzchenbacken?
What does "Baumschmücken" mean in English?
Is anyone playing music?
Is Santa Claus coming, or is the Christ child, or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
Regardless of how you do it, everyone puts in effort to have a wonderful time as a family during Christmas.
Whether it's a fixed tradition or even something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number or anything else that could help.
Transfer Confirmation... etc.
I would like to decode a coupon code.
As with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers.
How is it going with them?
The title is given, I am a mobile pharmacist working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
As these are soon to be completed, it goes on to vaccination centers for me.
I would gladly answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility is the information on vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical staff.
In pharmacies, we often don't have pharmaceutical technicians, but only "nur" (for God's sake, no missing appreciation!) pharmaceutical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot perform vaccinations (can they?), so that I also perform most of the vaccinations there.
Heavy "Helper" question: Amberg knows the solution.
Please provide the text you would like me to translate from German to English.
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, there has been ensured hefty thinking in the BR television show "We in Bavaria".
However, unlike many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained unrecognized by the callers this time.
No, it was not "a person who is nervous".
And also, "no one has to go fast".
According to what people heard from the TV presenter, it is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced and probably caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate residents.
The conductor, the audience learned, is a cloth used to wipe the stove.
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for many years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern".
With the closure of an educational gap - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I can't buy books for two weeks now.
After confirmation, the following error message is displayed: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Is tire choice when racing on a road bike really as safe as they claim?
Today morning, I woke up full of the desire to act, because I still wanted to train a little for my upcoming cycling tour next week.
Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then what happened, which always lurks in every city center (this time: thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Fragments of glass on the track.
Zach, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to participate in the rest of the journey on no account.
Since I didn't have the opportunity due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train back home.
If the technical aspect wasn't quite as bad, maybe it would be better if I practiced changing the tire before the bike tour.
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would very much prefer not to encounter this problem frequently.
Now it was really not bad, because also the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had 140km on them when I picked up the bike at 10am!) were still there and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years.
But if I think about it, that I have to change the tire after 80-90km, then I am convinced that I am really in a bad mood:D
Now I came into conversation with an older man at the platform, who wondered why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unflatable.
Now it sounds very tempting.
But are these really indestructible?
I don't feel like spending 40€ per tire right now, just to be disappointed.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on the racing bike at the moment.
There are also available (apparently) at Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! Do you rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you very much in advance for the help and lovely greetings!

Hello to everyone,
We can now announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible to have more than four people in the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
At least three people will be present per switch so that we can watch the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you will follow us!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic - we'll still do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will be around 0:30.
Make yourself some drinks cold, prepare good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
