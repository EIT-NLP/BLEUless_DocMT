A certificate that feels very meaningful - Emergency Certificate
This is one of the skills certificates that I think are important besides my driver's license!
Promote the understanding: Emergency rescue measures are actually emergency rescue and rescue measures to be taken before the arrival of the ambulance in the event of an emergency.
It is commonly known that there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the event of an accident. In fact, this period of time is the most critical.
At this point, it is the time for emergency aid.
If I really had a heart attack, stroke, or stopped breathing, our window of opportunity for saving our lives would only be four minutes and 20 seconds, the golden four minutes!
So how important is it for people around you to know first aid!
When someone collapses near us, we can use our professional knowledge to perform CPR and save their life, rather than standing there helplessly and doing nothing. The feeling of helplessness is truly terrifying.
In China, our official data shows that there are 300,000 unintentional deaths every year, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 70% can be saved. In Shanghai and Beijing, it is below 1%.
This is what the first respondent, Lu Le, said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, performing CPR on them is useless.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to possibly save someone.
I have found that there are few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation arises, they are unable to act. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
It may be able to save a life!
Emergency first aid certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and students also have discounts.
The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before turning 25, and adding the emergency certification to the goal list was a few months ago, but I have actually accomplished it!
After that, I plan to take the other certifications I want to take, and I want to take a diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving emergency certification, and it seems that you need an emergency certification to take this certification, so an emergency certification is still very useful!

The experimental modern vocational school in Chongqing adopts the apprenticeship system for entering students as corporate trainees - Xinhua Net.
Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Bureau that starting this year, our city will pilot the "Modern Apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 vocational schools. At the same time, students who are accepted for trial training will also have the status of apprentices, and after being admitted, they will be pre-registered as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The municipal education bureau requires that the admission and employment of vocational school students be standardized, and that engineering programs be used by enterprises. The dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise trainees should be clearly defined, and the principle of mutual selection should be followed. Vocational school students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For students who have turned 16 but have not yet turned 18, agreements must be signed by the student, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise to determine the rights and interests of each party and the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits to be provided during on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-style forms of cooperation with enterprises in conducting pre-employment training and on-the-job training for employees.
The pilot schools are going to reform the mode of talent cultivation.
The school and enterprise jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Trial period to cultivate the curriculum as a trial period, students' internship time in the enterprise is determined according to the vocational talent cultivation plan, and the top internship is generally 6 months.
In corporate practice, the enterprise team-based management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different professions, a teacher can lead 2 to 5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship pilot projects in three batches, with each pilot project enrolling around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
According to the principle of starting from pilot programs and gradually expanding from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integration of talents, in order to effectively enhance students' job skills and improve their employment rate and quality.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and in the end, it was ruthlessly scrapped. The dust suction effect is not bad, and the amount of dust in the house has decreased significantly. However, when holding it with one hand, it feels a bit heavy. The moist wipe needs to be improved, as there will be dust marks when wiping back and forth. Overall, I am still satisfied.
The rice cooker is quite heavy and looks quite tall, which is suitable for someone like me who is a novice in the kitchen. The child said that the food I cooked tasted better than my own, and I have made two dishes of braised pork belly and stir-fried vegetables. The braised pork belly with sugar and vinegar is particularly delicious, although it takes a long time to cook. The other dishes take very little time to prepare, and the noise is very small, so you don't have to worry about making a mess or not knowing how to cook.
Received the goods. I hurriedly cooked three dishes at noon, and technology has really changed life. The control of fire and seasoning is precise, and the taste of the dishes is directly upgraded to the level of a professional chef. It's great, and for those who are not skilled in cooking, it is a godsend, recommended to buy!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Intelligent frying machine, with automatic temperature control and automatic stir-frying.
No longer need to worry about being scalded by hot oil, no longer need to worry about not controlling the fire well and overcooking or burning the vegetables.
The dish that was stir-fried tasted better than what I made, the stir-fried eggplant was particularly delicious, and the taste of the chicken egg was particularly good.
This pot is worth buying.
The East and West are good, worth buying, very good.
Overall, it is good and consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large and clear, and it doesn't tire the eyes. I haven't found any other abnormalities so far.
The current display is thicker than the mainstream one, and the border is wider by a bit. The gap between the border and the screen is a bit large, but the screen display effect is not bad, and all accessories are complete.
Logistics speed is fast!
The store's service attitude is good!
After using it for a while, the quality is good, and the screen resolution is also very clear.
Stir-frying stocks is really great, a score of 4 out of 5, it's perfect.
Logistics are fast, the goods are good, the second purchase is definitely good stuff, with a high-quality display that does not distort even though the screen is large, and a full-featured interface.
It looks great, the colors are restored well, and the quality is good!

But there was no rider to take the food home.
South African doctor: Omicron spreads rapidly, but most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province have reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's chief physician, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but there are no patients who need to be hospitalized.
Fauci said: "They can control diseases at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and patients with health problems, who are more likely to fall into severe illness due to the novel coronavirus.
He said, compared to the previous wave of the Delta COVID-19 outbreak, the patients he treated with COVID-19 "had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels."
Many people will need to be hospitalized within a few days.
Within two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks, the doctor's observation and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic; the average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; in recent cases of COVID-19, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of the disease in South Africa was 20%.
The Director of the African Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, cited data from the National Infectious Disease Research Institute and other reports to say, "Currently, all signs point to a relatively mild disease."
He also said, "It's still early, we need to obtain post-event data."
Usually, hospitalization and death occur later in the course of the disease, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments.
Although Delta is still the dominant strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries, with South Africa serving as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to the health officer, in the first week of December, the number of new cases discovered in Hubei Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that over 90% of the cases were caused by the Omicron variant.
Thank you to all the supporters today! All 80 boxes have been sent out!

Yang Hao Dong was speaking about the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress in Maanshan.
Draw strength and inspiration from the century-long struggle of the Party.
According to a report from Hunan Daily on December 10th (reporter Gan Paiwei), according to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th morning, provincial committee standing committee member and propaganda department minister Yang Hongdong gave a interactive lecture at the video creative park in Mashan, deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th provincial party congress.
Yang Hao Dong, from the perspective of ideals, beliefs, and original intentions, as well as self-revolution and the Youth Party, combined with the leadership of the Party and Party theory, has comprehensively and systematically expounded the core spirit and practical requirements of the conference from three aspects.
He pointed out that it is important to combine the spirit and instructions of the Party Central Committee's important speech and General Secretary Xi Jinping's important instructions with the spirit of the provincial Party Congress, and to integrate theory and practice, strengthen the self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two maintenance", and make political, political, and action-oriented self-consciousness, and unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive exchange session, representatives from the grassroots level, business representatives, and youth representatives discussed the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishes", how cultural enterprises should seize the opportunity, and how new generations of youth can draw strength from a century of party history. Yang Haidong answered the questions with plain language and vivid examples, urging young party members to draw strength from the century-long struggle of the party and to tighten their bonds with the central leadership of the party, to unswervingly follow the party, and to use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and shoulder the burden.

They will implement dynamic management with "one-life, one-policy," recommending at least five job positions for each graduate, ensuring that 100% of graduates with employment intentions from difficult families receive assistance.
Actually, I's not sure if it's the store's fault or the delivery person's fault.
There is no invoice on the bag.
I'm sorry, but "追查不了" is not a complete sentence or phrase in English. It appears to be a combination of Chinese characters that may have a specific meaning or context in Chinese, but without further information or context, it is difficult to provide an accurate translation in English. If you could provide more information or context, I would be happy to try to assist you further.
I hope you all understand.
Because the estimated delivery time has been accelerated by 30 minutes.
There is no translation for "没有了，谢谢" in English. It is a Chinese phrase that can be translated as "Thank you anyway" or "It's okay, thank you".
Yes, I have changed a rider.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been saying that they are handling it.
Waited for a few hours.
I have already taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know.
However, the restaurant does not know why the delivery time is constantly being delayed.
It turns out that #NUMBER#  Note: Please replace #NUMBER# with the actual number you want to translate.
That's it, I'm not going to call anymore.
I'm sorry, but "不吃了" is a Chinese phrase that doesn't have a direct translation in English. It can be translated as "I'm full" or "I can't eat anymore" depending on the context in which it is used.
I will definitely sue.
"You can't send it, so why are you talking so late?"
Wait for you so long.
No, I haven't received the call.
Please inform him to send to our company again.
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.

Hello, the chicken you ordered from the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively cheap coach first.
Unfriendly, in fact, price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't tell the difference, then expensive normal situation will be more friendly than cheap "entry-level" products, this kind of "entry-level" products is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control.
The logic and hidden agenda behind it is that tennis is so difficult to learn, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll sell you some cheap junk and mess you up so you won't play anymore. After playing twice, you won't want to play anymore. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel sorry for yourself.
"Wait until you can really distinguish good from bad, which means you've made progress. Then come back here to buy expensive things, and I'll earn two times the money."
It is recommended to spend a similar amount of money and buy a second-hand racket that is in good condition, choose between Prince or Donnay. These two brands do not have a strong reputation, so a good racket will not sell for a high price. A new racket for 500-600 yuan is sufficient, while a second-hand one for 200 yuan is also acceptable. Wouldn't you enjoy having a racket worth thousands of yuan?
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once the newcomer stage is over, I become arrogant. However, most people, especially women, cannot pass the newcomer stage.
The order has been delayed multiple times for delivery.

In the next three years, Jiangxi will train 100,000 rural elementary school physical education and music teachers - Xinhua Net.
According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Nanchang on May 22nd, a reporter recently learned from the Education Department of Jiangxi Province that in order to strengthen the teacher team for shortage subjects and achieve balanced development of rural compulsory education, starting from 2016, the Jiangxi Province has planned to train 1,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for rural schools (villages and below) within three years. This is to ensure the ability to guarantee the rural compulsory education.
According to the understanding, the training objects are primary school teachers in rural areas in Jiangxi who have a music, art, or physical education subject knowledge or talent, and can also teach other subjects besides music, art, and physical education.
Through training, they will acquire basic knowledge and teaching skills in the field of aesthetics of sound body, update teaching concepts and ideas, master modern teaching methods, improve their teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of multi-skilled sound body aesthetics teachers. This will alleviate the problem of insufficient number of rural sound body aesthetics teachers.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi has planned to send one music, art, and sports trainer to each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, with a total of 300 trainers, in order to comprehensively enhance their teaching demonstration leading capabilities, teaching research activity design capabilities, teaching and training capabilities, and network online workshop construction capabilities, and play the roles of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
Because waiting for another 20 minutes would have already waited for an hour #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want the food I made 1 hour ago.
I have found the buyer for the previous incorrect order.
However, I can't find my tire.
Hello, how long will it take for the ordered food to be delivered?
The workers have finished their work.
Your driver's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.

In fact, there are many discussions about the dressing and matching for girls with a slim body.
The girl with a heavy body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
If your skirt is too short, it will reveal your fat on your legs.
The longer it is, the more it will give a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear clothes that are divided into upper and lower sections, it will give the impression that you have naturally grown taller. For example, using different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks will create a sense of length.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard outfit for thin girls (the author has a deep understanding of this point), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your fat body. Elegant black short skirts are the first choice for thin girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a black mini skirt, will make you look thinner.
If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more popular it is, the better. And the color shouldn't be too bright.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, make people feel fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is important to learn the principles of proper clothing and accessory matching.
Don't wear tight short skirts, and don't wear clothes that are too short or stuffed into your skirt. It will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black tights or mesh tights (the kind with fine grids, please). Choose a soft floral print dress that is comfortable to wear, and pair it with a cardigan-style top that can well cover the flaws of a chubby girl.
Of course, even thin girls wearing short skirts also have their own standards.
A fat girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will enhance the effect of making her body look slimmer.
Short skirts paired with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer combination!
If you are pear-shaped but have skinny legs, I recommend choosing a short dress with a glamorous feel.
Not only can it cover your belly fat, but it can also highlight your advantages.
A short skirt will look very slimming, which is more suitable for overweight girls. When choosing an upper garment, it is recommended to choose something that is tight-fitting, which will create a layering effect and make you look even slimmer.
Simply put, a white T-shirt can be paired with a short skirt. Even pear-shaped people can try it.
Thin girls can also have a stylish look.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and styling, even skinny girls will be the focus of everyone's attention.
There have been changes in clothing and accessory coordination, and it's important to exercise more in daily life to try to escape the "fat girl" label earlier in the day 😄

I don't want to.

After the investigation, you would say something like this: "I checked the address several times before placing the order."
Okay, thank you! How many days is it?
From 7:00 am to now 9:30 am, none of them have been sent, you must return the deposit and cancel the order.

The title of the new district in Shenzhen is the "Super Runner with the Loudest Exhaust Sound!"
This time, our team brings you a car that is many men's dream!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini, the successor model to Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
The price of this car is close to two hundred thousand yuan, and the road tax for a year is tens of thousands of yuan. It is a four-wheel drive vehicle, so why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
According to the data, the acceleration from 0-100km/h only takes 2.9 seconds, which means that by the time myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, the flamboyant scissor doors, the massive air intakes all around the car, and the glass that provides an unobstructed view of the 6.5 V12 engine, perfectly embodies the style of Lamborghini.
For car models, there is no need to explain too much. You can simply Google it and find the information you need. Our team has summarized some explanations that Google may not have provided.
Too eye-catching, everyone is looking at it wherever it goes, and I feel quite uncomfortable! (Actually, it's quite refreshing.)
1km油钱在R1左右 (车主根本不care)
It's important to practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit embarrassing (because you might not be able to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, it will make you deaf immediately after getting off the car (but it's still enjoyable).
The car is too big to stop at a regular parking spot. It's too narrow and I'm afraid that when the car next to me opens their door, it will hit mine!
A bit lonely because there is no opponent on the road (said by the editor, unrelated to the car owner, haha)
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the super-charging of this video is not for sale, I apologize!
If you want to shoot videos for your car and have friends who are interested, please feel free to contact us!
More car news that you may not know is available at The Car Guide / People's Car Chronicle.
Involving an accident with a value of millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. The Bugatti Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911's price is also in the million-dollar range!
On that day before, foreign countries had knocked down millions of sports cars in just a few minutes, including the 911 and the million-dollar Chiron!

In Guangxi, university students can take up to five years off from their studies to start a business - Xinhua Net.
According to a special report from the Xinhua News Agency in Nanning on May 19th (reporter Zhang Ying), reporters recently learned from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department that starting from the next academic year, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, relax the limits on the number of years students can take off from school, and allow undergraduate students to extend their break from school by 2 to 5 years to start a business while still in school. The time spent on entrepreneurship during this period can be counted as practical education time.
In order to enhance the entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities of university students, the departments of education and civil affairs in Guangxi have joined forces to build an entrepreneurship platform. They are also constructing more off-campus practice teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external support for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirement, by 2020, the area of each university's innovation and entrepreneurship practice base should reach 3,000 square meters or above for undergraduate schools, and 2,000 square meters or above for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship education divisions and prioritizes supporting outstanding students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice.
College teachers should have at least two months of on-the-job training at industrial enterprises every two years to enhance their awareness and ability to promote innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The education bureau of the autonomous region requires all universities in Guizhou to deeply implement the plan for training college students in innovation and entrepreneurship, and strive to ensure that every college student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school period.
Colleges should actively organize students to participate in various levels of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.

Chinese text: 美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网  English translation: A group of Asian-American organizations has filed a complaint against Yale and three other Ivy League universities, alleging discrimination in their admissions processes. - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Washington D.C., May 23rd, 2023 (Reporter: Xu Jianmei) More than 100 Asian American groups in the United States submitted a complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23rd, protesting against the discrimination against Asian American applicants by three Ivy League universities - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, in their admission process.
The Asian American Education League, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the lawsuit.
The president of this organization, Wu Qiangkong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three top American schools has basically remained the same.
Many studies indicate that these universities engage in a so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process that "systematically and persistently discriminates against Asian applicant students."
Zhao Yuchun introduced that the research conducted by Sander et al. in 2014 showed that among the top three universities, the relative number of applicants and the admission rate for Asian Americans were the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Davidson College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yuchun told reporters from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint, and after that, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can conduct investigations and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions.
They also hope to be sued by universities and for universities to actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded.
The Alliance for Asian American Education was established in 2015. At that time, they had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons.
This time, in addition to Chinese-American organizations, there were also Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, Pakistani-American, and Bangladeshi-American educational organizations that participated in the lawsuit.
Need utensils.
Just canceled the order.
Why is it still in execution?

Can I contact them directly by phone?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu discussed the details of purchasing the factory and the ownership of the house with the family members of the property owner, Ms. Lin, and transferred the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Ms. Lin's account on the same day through a bank transfer.
Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Room Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the payee, and it was clearly stated that "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory room, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory room, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agree to sign the factory room purchase and sale agreement within one week."
However, after that, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the housing purchase contract.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin withdrew the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
It's difficult to find a house that meets your expectations, and after paying the deposit and preparing the down payment, you're just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller doesn't sell. This makes Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court.
The court of law, after examining the evidence, believes that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not responsible for paying double the returned deposit for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
Lawyer's Reminder: Be cautious and exercise due diligence in the trading process.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise caution and fulfill the necessary due diligence, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.

What is the correct way to drink red label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people enjoy collecting, some people enjoy food, of course, there are also people who enjoy drinking wine, and Glenfiddich 15 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won the gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has a unique flavor, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, isn't it a waste of its fragrant aroma?
So, how do you drink the red label whiskey?
The editor will briefly introduce it to everyone.
Red Label whiskey drinking method:  1. Pour 45 ml of Red Label whiskey into a glass. 2. Fill the glass with ice cubes. 3. Stir the whiskey and ice cubes for 15-20 seconds. 4. Strain the mixture into a chilled glass. 5. Garnish with a slice of lemon or orange. 6. Enjoy your Red Label whiskey.
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky is made from about 35 types of Scottish whisky and has a strong, fruity aroma and characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The aroma contains a sweet and smoky flavor.
The aroma of the tea is rich and fragrant, with a slight hint of smoke and a strong aroma of roasted malt.
This wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite beverage.
Red Label whiskey has entered the domestic market, in order to suit the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey + Coca-Cola or Sprite or New Coke, etc. carbonated beverages have become a fashionable and long-lasting trend.
These sweet beverages can not only neutralize acidity but also provide visual pleasure and enhance the flavor when added to the drink. They can also act as a mixer to dilute the taste of alcohol and change the taste of the drink.
The red label whiskey, cut with a slice of lemon, and powdered sugar (sand sugar is also acceptable), is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic flavor of red wine has a slightly sour and warm taste. Adding sugar can neutralize the sour taste, and lemon can bring a refreshing citrus aroma. Of course, the sweet-sour balance can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to drink red-label whiskey. You can try them as a reference and I hope my introduction can help you.
If it is not possible to change the store location, can it be changed to delivery instead?
Then I don't need to give you more money, right?

Golden Lady Wedding Photography (South Street Store) is temporarily without branches.
Before taking photos, we didn't have a scheduled time and had to change it twice. However, our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time for us.
Later, I chose a weekend to go out and take photos.
The staff of Madame Gold, regardless of whether they are advisors, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised.
That was my first time formally putting on makeup, wow~ I can't believe it, one day I'll look that good too, haha.
Xiaoyi and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name anymore) apply makeup very patiently and naturally.
The scenery in Jiangwan City was filmed outdoors, fortunately the weather was good that day and I didn't feel too cold. During the filming, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and would quickly help us fix anything that wasn't quite right.
The photographer is also very witty. After taking pictures all day, he feels very happy.
When selecting photos, because we have seen many cases online, we do not want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we select photos, there is really no intention to add more photos. We just choose the 24 photos included in the package, and none of them are added (I heard that my cousin who took wedding photos with me charged over 7,000 yuan for a package that included over 10,000 photos, which surprised me and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today the photos were retouched and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at them and found two that I didn't think were very good. They immediately helped me retouch them again.
Compare the photos that my little sister took before with the ones I just took. I think our photos are really satisfying, simple and fresh, just the style I want.
I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuan Han Jin's studio to take their wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan
Madam Kwan is grateful to have you all and sincerely wishes you all happiness and a prosperous life. The future looks bright!

Your name is Zhang Ying, and this is your second week in Japan.
You were walking on the street when suddenly someone was following you. You were afraid and walked faster and faster until you ran away.
The person behind you is calling: "Miss! Please wait!" (Entire Japanese conversation) You have stopped at the door of the convenience store.
Miss... I am a director. You look very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?
You are doubtful and afraid that this is a scam.
He gave you a business card and you found out that he was the director of a large entertainment company from Japan.
Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company and talk. The fee will definitely not be high.
You bumped into him at the company, and he said he saw you right away on the street and was very eager for you to join.
You signed the contract thinking there would be no loss and you could still make money.
This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts.

So, can the system see the new order?
So how would you handle the rider?
I don't think I can accept an order that takes more than 20 minutes to deliver and hasn't been delivered yet.
In Sabah, 320 newborn babies did not receive birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the special measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
According to a news report from Sabah on the 11th, the Sabah Immigration Department said that due to the depletion of anti-forgery paper stock, they have been unable to issue birth certificates for newborn babies since early October, and the number of affected individuals has reached 3,200 so far.
However, the head of the department, Kai-ru Amunus, guarantees that all infants who have applied for admission certificates have had their materials recorded in the system. Once the anti-forgery papers arrive next week, they will be sent out.
At a news conference, he addressed the issue of a 10-month-long report by a net
He said that the problem appeared two months ago, and Sandra also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces special anti-forgery paper has been affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivery to our country.
He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, and therefore cannot be borrowed from other states.
Kai Ru Amins revealed that the latest batch of anti-forgery paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Wednesday to purchase goods, and they will immediately proceed to Sabah for the final printing stage. It is estimated that it will take about two working days (December 20th) to deliver to the applicant.
"We will inform the applicants to go to each branch office to pick up the application forms."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
From 7:00 AM to now.

Oil pipeline video exposes US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhua Net
(Video source: oil pipe)  Translation:  （视频来源：油管）  (Video source: oil pipe)
On February 11th, a documentary titled "Killing Machine" caused widespread attention on the oil pipeline platform.
This film tells the story of the United States invoking the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to launch a war in Afghanistan, forcefully exporting American-style democracy, resulting in 20 years of poorly trained, bloodthirsty, and sadistic soldiers committing countless atrocities against innocent civilians.
Misusing drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites distorts human nature and forms a murderous group.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has established "black sites" to subject "criminals" to various forms of torture and humiliation.
A series of anti-human crimes has aroused more hatred among Afghans.
As the video says, the "anti-terrorism" war in the United States is becoming "more and more terrifying."
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the Afghan people. Instead, it has brought only a country full of scars and destruction, and countless killings.
Let's watch the video together and unveil the truth behind America's "anti-terrorism" bloodbath, piercing through the hypocrisy and false facade of American democracy!
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it cooled down, it became hard and brittle, making it impossible to eat.

Sure, I can.
But also remind the restaurant and the driver.
Avoid it from happening again next time.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
That time is constantly delayed.
I don't know how long I have to wait.
If the order is canceled, can the refund be returned?
How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
One cyclist was confirmed one hour ago.
I am no longer willing to wait.
Don't scare people on the starting line - Xinhua Net
When browsing the book market, you can often feel the heat of successful self-help books.
The successful books today often tout "the best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it.
It's equivalent to saying that once you've gone beyond the "how-to" phase, which is actually the most fundamental and crucial part.
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done to the best of one's ability, or they are not done at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb the Great Wall, or you just stay put where you are.
This "best principle" is recognized as "extremely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people will be intimidated and start at the starting line.
Because this theory encourages a path of "you must be willing to suffer and make a 180-degree transformation," which is a fatal weakness for many people.
For those who are rigid in their ways, adhere to outdated traditions, and reject change, you are particularly inclined to shout "you need to transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly a form of self-deception and deceiving others.
The vast majority of people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate, unable to take the first step. Alternatively, they may make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and boldly take the first step, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for very long before giving up.
The famous "From Tomorrow" joke by Mr. Ma Sanli, which is a classic representation of the "universal human nature", is widely circulated.
The biggest problem with "the ultimate principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limits of ordinary people's abilities, causing most people to feel overwhelmed and amazed.
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" may be a path that can lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful life.
The core of the "second principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "gathering small victories" - if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb the small sand hill in front of your door, because that's also stronger than just standing still.
In summary, if you have done something, it is always better than not doing anything.
Due to the significant reduction of barriers, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres, the chance of success will also increase.
Only by following the "principle of second-best" can one achieve success. The path to success may be longer, but it is still achievable.
In summary, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone's success, but in reality, it only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many as possible.
Now, do I need to re-place an order?
The phone is not being answered by anyone.
"不停延误" is a Chinese phrase that can be translated to English as "never stop making mistakes." It is often used to encourage someone to keep trying and learning, even if they make mistakes along the way.
Still hasn't arrived.
Excuse me, how many hours will it take to arrive?
How can I contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two meals, but an order has been completed.
I would like to ask how to contact the rider.
The first rider just told me that there will be another rider who will send someone.
Qinghai Lake carps' resources have increased by 71,000 tons this year - Xinhua Net.
According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on December 11, 2022, the latest monitoring results show that the biological resources of Qinghai Lake have increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching a total of 10.85 million tons. This is an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake carp is commonly known as "Kari" and is a precious fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the early 20th century and the 1960s and 1970s, the large-scale killing and overpopulation of Qinghai Lake carp led to the deterioration of the aquatic environment, resulting in a sharp decrease in the number of Qinghai Lake carp. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Pufferfish was listed as an endangered species in the Red Data Book of China.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake and prohibited any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for crucian carp in Qinghai Lake and its main tributaries. It is also prohibited to sell crucian carp and their products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and releasing, as well as the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientifically reasonable "passageways" for fish, the protection measures have been continuously strengthened, and the hidden resource of Qinghai Lake's crucian carp has increased year by year.
The vice director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, nearly 1.8 million fingerlings of Qinghai crucian carp have been artificially bred and released into Qinghai Lake, which has contributed more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake's crucian carp resources.
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water-sustaining area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the western desert to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment and water-related wildlife in the Three Gorges region and the Qinghai Lake water body, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment has successively issued emergency bans on fishing in key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system for "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which needs to be filled up and the weather is cold.
Would you like to know if takeout is packed in a bag?
We only see a bag.
"Want to know if it was accidentally sent or if someone took it, thanks."
It has been an hour and I still haven't sent it.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending gifts that disappoint is quite common.
To order an additional meal for the kids to eat.
I hope even in the busiest store, there will be a check on the products.
Is it a case of leaking electricity if your feet feel tingly after a foot bath?
Choosing an appropriate bathtub can have good therapeutic effects on foot health, and today's national beauty editor will provide answers to this issue, hoping to be helpful to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of different product series have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
On the relevant data, compared with traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are selling hot, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety hazards.
"Stepping into electrified water is really too dangerous!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a bathtub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father got into the tub, he felt his feet go numb.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried writing with an electric pen, and to his surprise, the pen actually lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to discover that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they canceled the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as the popular foot bath basin being used at the highest temperature setting, applicable to which population group, and what materials ensure safety.
However, in general, bathtubs do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process.
Therefore, when buying a bathtub, choose a whirlpool bathtub.
Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards.
At the same time, you can take the pen test at your convenience.

Result: Photo effect: Overall, it's not bad. I particularly like this set of pictures.
Service details: During the makeup process, I felt a bit uncomfortable. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while. They also kept bringing me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 RMB
Thank you for the review of the rabbit. At first, I was going to reject the ancient style, but the final product is simply too beautiful.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of energy and continue to move forward. We will continue to cheer you on!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend all friends to come and visit!
Regardless of how you look at it, whether it's the reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, or post-production, it's all top-notch.
The makeup artist is particularly meticulous, and will carefully match makeup products to suit your style. The makeup products used are all from top brands.
Mr. Ding is no longer needed to speak, photography is quite professional.
The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens accompanying and playing around.
We are working in Beijing, and all the good movie theaters in Beijing need to be queued up half a year in advance. My colleagues who have been to Beijing have said that the final product is just so.
I particularly sought after this workshop, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, and we feel that this is also a common problem for most people. The photographer, Brother Shine, will take pictures and record the natural and exciting moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, an excellent team.
Everyone praises it when it comes out in the form of a movie.
Already recommended to my girlfriend, and my girlfriend was also very satisfied after watching the movie.
I hope this kind of workshop won't be buried, and more people discover TA, and shoot their own style, rather than being formulaic.
Thank you very much, Cai Xiong and Qing Ling, for your five-star reviews. Both of you are very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are a creative workshop, and we will do our best to complete the work to the satisfaction of the client, no matter how much we have to put in. Thank you for meeting and getting to know each other.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and outgoing photography teacher, made for a great team. Everyone in the team was super nice, and the experience of taking the photos was an unforgettable one. The results of the photos were even better than I had imagined, and everyone worked hard. We are very grateful to everyone. 😘😘
Thank you for your review, getting to know you is also a coincidence. From Huhehaote to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is equivalent to several thousand kilometers of road. I am very happy to meet you, and I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao and play again next time.
How do I give money?
The delivered meal has been sent again.
There is no rider to receive.
Now the waiter is calling me.
A beginner programmer who wants to share their personal experience.
If you are planning to enter this industry, it is possible to choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it is better to self-study, after all, the cost of training is very high and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-reliance and are weak. Training is also a very good choice for them.
If you have strong self-study ability, you can also choose to self-study, but it may be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important.
First, let's look at the human resources of this institution. If the human resources are not strong enough, there is no meaning to this training institution. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong human resources.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is recommended to investigate the institution itself and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can truly evaluate the quality of the institution and the quality of the courses they teach.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because there has been no introduction to your personal situation, and there is a great relationship between learning this and your personal situation.
For example, professional background, age, desired language, and even the city where you want to study or work can all be related to the industry you want to study or work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is relatively high, and the time and effort required for investment are relatively large, and basically require concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online now, or you can also find training resources on B station. If you don't know where to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction and obtain free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with video learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time, I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning will not be too difficult, and the teacher's explanations are very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone specifically to answer them. In addition, there is also help with learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after they finish their studies. This way, when they go for job interviews in the future, they can save a lot of time and effort.
The above are some of my thoughts. As I don't understand your situation, I only roughly introduced them and didn't go into detail. If you have any other questions or consultations, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.
I said 1 point before, I saw it on the App.

This person accepts various services, including installation, cleaning, repair of water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil boilers, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional tailoring, and housekeeping services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life can be tiring, but we must continue to strive for it.
Life will not disappoint those who make every effort. If you like it, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only look at the results, while we alone support the process, face life, besides being strong, we must continue, we have no choice, the road can be looked back upon but cannot be retraced...
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility, and life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes exciting through heartfelt effort.
Although we are doing the dirtiest job, we will use the most sincere attitude to thoroughly clean every corner of the customer's house. Seeing the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised index finger, at that moment, all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort is finally rewarded!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
Serve with your heart, clean with your heart, and keep the beauty.
Your attention to detail is greatly appreciated, and we at Feng Jue Ji Guan have done our best to meet your expectations. Our service is dedicated to loving and caring for your family.
May all households be safe and clean, with a healthy and prosperous family. May the tree in the courtyard flourish, and may the government officials be upright and honest. May your service be in the right place, and may your home be clean and tidy.
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull and lackluster if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only by cleaning them can they shine with their full color and brilliance, just like life.
To succeed, one must put their heart into it, and to create something exquisite, one must pay attention to every detail. We take our craftsmanship seriously.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is worthy of trust, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
It's tough all around right now!
However, I always believe that as long as I have sincerity, perseverance, and effort, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who just sit and complain.
The plan for a day is made in the morning, all the beauty starts from the morning. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and everything you wish for as you set out on a new day, maintaining a good mood all day long. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed, and having it made us happy; as we grew older, happiness became a goal we sought to achieve, and achieving it made us happy; but as we matured, we discovered that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it made us happy.
Do your best to be the most authentic and kind version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in life; life is one journey, walk your own path; the two treasures of life are a healthy body and a good mood, live a beautiful and radiant life until old age!
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
Often, what binds you is not your ability, but your active courage.
Since we can't avoid it, it's better to face it head-on.
The more you fear, the more likely you are to be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face challenges head-on, problems will eventually be resolved.
"China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will hold the first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in collaboration with the Saudi Ministry of Culture." - Xinhua Net
The Xinhua News Agency reported on December 12th that the first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia, the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the north of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.
This year's exhibition is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Dune Art Museum in China, with UCCA Dune Art Museum director Tian Peng as the art director.
According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this biannual exhibition is "Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, and also reflects the current situation of Saudi society and culture.
This year's exhibition covers an area of nearly 1200 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Touching Stones Across the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among the 27 Saudi Arabian artists, the number of works accounted for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering a variety of forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. 12 Chinese artists' works were also highly anticipated, with some artists using innovative ways to recycle materials in their creations, such as Xu Bing, who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials in his work "Behind the Story Series - The Endless Mountains of Sichuan" (2014).
According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Daliyé Biennale Foundation, Barkley, he hopes that this year's biennale can establish an international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the vibrant cultural and creative industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen exchanges and interactions.
Ding Tingyu said, "The objective of the biennial is double-fold, not only can it allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, but also allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to the understanding, during the two-year exhibition cycle, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Comprehensive and standardized management of rural public welfare positions - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12, 2022 (reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continue to do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, to consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The Department of Ethnic and Religious Affairs of Yunnan Province has introduced that, at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public service positions, which are used to place impoverished labor forces and other rural difficult-to-employ groups, and play an important role in helping impoverished populations achieve employment increases, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services in various aspects.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Civilization Department, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and seven other departments. It mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of job allocation, the new regulations are clear and follow the principles of "job-based allocation, position-based allocation, dynamic management, and quantity control," as well as "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management."
The recruitment process must follow the steps of advertisement, application, review, disclosure, hiring, on-the-job training, and assignment.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing rural public welfare positions, and stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position appointees. It was also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.

Although right-wing forces have had some periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight, but they sweat profusely when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they show a bit of ambition, they are immediately attacked and defeated.
But in practice, the rightists have played an active role in promoting social progress.
From the perspective of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, promoting economic development, enhancing technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing cannot be denied.
3. As for me, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he has to say and I hold him in high regard as a person; this is because he is sincere, he takes China seriously, and he seriously considers China's social problems.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is unnecessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to the people's livelihood, and chaos in political organizations. Furthermore, foreign powers will take advantage of the opportunity to invade.
4. To change or improve China, one needs patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who attempt to profit politically from the situation are not rightists, but just a bunch of scoundrels.
Let's talk more.
Left, in fact, is a group of orphans of a generation and politics.
If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has been deprived of this opportunity because the left's demands are what the Communist Party has discarded.
5. Recently, I've seen some friends siding with the enemy and refuting the leftist comrades, and they seem to be quite passionate about it. I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with the Han collaborators or the leftist lunatics. It's all nonsense.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the opponents and leftists acknowledge it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the enemy insults you with "five cents," and when the left-handed person insults you with "right dog," it just proves that our middle way is correct!
Many people when they were young also had ideals, but as they grew older, they forgot about them or pursued them to the point of becoming obsessive.
The ideal gradually recedes into the distance, and even the young dragon eventually becomes an evil dragon.
I believe that "左右" generally refers to constraints and freedom. Historically and culturally, China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left.
In China, the right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and places a greater emphasis on fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, while China and the United States are in competition, and the leftist ideology is generally accepted, and it is estimated to continue for many years to come.
Although you can't understand it, just liking it is enough to get the job done.
What's the point of talking about it? Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
I'm sorry, but "不等了" is a Chinese phrase that doesn't have a direct translation to English. It can be translated as "Can't wait" or "Excited" depending on the context in which it is used. Can you please provide more context or information about the phrase so I can better assist you?
By 19:06, I had already placed the order for 2 hours. 😅
Let's take a look at some [strange searches] today.
What is a normal mood?
Translate the following text from Chinese to English:  Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lunar New Year, the increase in the price of good friends, and the commodity price-raising event. The public opinion spreads out and forms a wave, then the "exponential decrease" (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If there is secondary public opinion, there may be a small wave again.
They look exactly the same as the【Network Sentiment Evolution Model】displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of [isolated peak], [sawtooth], and [cliff].
The following text describes three different states of a hot search topic on Chinese social media:  【孤峰状】This refers to a sudden surge in popularity due to individual users sharing and promoting the topic, resulting in widespread interest and attention.  【锯齿状】This refers to cyclical heating, where the topic remains popular and continues to rank high on the hot search list, ensuring its relevance and popularity.  【断崖状】This refers to a collective withdrawal from the topic, as it has fulfilled its "function" and moved on to new challenges or battlefields.
In Figure 9, the peak of the event's hotness coincides with the trough of another event, and the time difference is only a second. It must be that the unified naval fleet received the task and launched a new round of offensives.
The professionalization of Weibo is evident in the fact that dozens of hot topics are simultaneously trending, with some attracting attention, some responsible for public education, some creating a sense of crisis, some shifting the focus of attention, some influencing cognition, some leading to misjudgments, some arousing emotions, some constraining decision-making, and so on. Weibo accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned in terms of nodes for battle, almost considering all factors in the spread of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science, discarding subjective factors such as stance and emotions, and only relying on objective data, even black public relations will have no place to hide.
Everyone who passes by will leave a trace, such traces, let's dig them up together.
The source of the data is the hot search time machine.
Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 - Xinhua Net.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th, 2021. According to a report from Xinhua's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
The first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 have been reported in Mauritius after 10 days.
According to the introduction by Mao Weiguo, the Minister of Commerce, Karel Jagtap, a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27, has been infected with the virus. Another infected person is a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius. This person tested positive for the virus on November 30.
After isolation and treatment at the hospital, the two infected individuals had negative nucleic acid test results and have returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country's first case of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus was confirmed.
Three of them are students, and they returned to China from abroad at the beginning of this month. They are all light cases and have not been hospitalized.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, the Chinese government is continuously strengthening its epidemic prevention and control measures.
From December 6th, 2022 to January 10th, 2023, passengers aged 12 and above entering China by flight will need to pay for nucleic acid testing at the airport upon arrival.
The National Health Commission announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in China with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Khumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had discovered its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.
The national health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from January 19th to December 2nd, and found these 3 cases of infection.

Received is a belly full of money.
The text "订单是凤爪" in Chinese translates to "Order is a talon" in English.
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff and explained.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
"Great America 360-degree home decoration"
Address: No. 156, South Ring Road, Happiness Garden, 12th Floor  Translation: Address: No. 156, South Ring Road, Happiness Garden, 12th Floor
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 for a basic renovation.
As soon as you arrive at the store, a series of tricks begin.
I am visiting the store for the first time, and I only showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the actual site to measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 700,000 RMB. They roughly looked at the materials and didn't know what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that if you go to the store, you will be asked to pay the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, the money is gone forever unless you have enough experience and can negotiate with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you a certain discount.
This is a big scam, and I am a living example of being deceived. When my mind was racing, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan.
The quotation he gave me has many problems. The price is 70,000 yuan excluding water and electricity renovation, and excluding any doors and cabinets for the bathroom. These three items are the main expenses for basic installation.
Except for these, their service points charge fees that are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything to me at the beginning and made me sign a contract.
When I went to get my money back from them, they acted like they had a lot of experience and had a special team ready to deal with me.
Regardless of how it is, it will be the customer's problem and they are entirely responsible.
There are various shifting of responsibilities, and there are many details. I don't want to go into all of them, but basically, don't choose them. My friend hired them to renovate their house, and the quality was not good. They will also charge you for various expenses in the future.
Dad, they were originally the head of the scam, now they're dressed up as dragons and seem to have closed down and reopened as something else.
So everyone, don't choose such a shitty renovation company.
Afterwards, when everyone is choosing, please take a closer look at these consultations because renovation is not a small matter.
To ask a merchant a question, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibited from publishing various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant's recording statement for details.

This is so terrifying. If you don't cancel the order within 30 minutes, please do so!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, if you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I'll definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The chicken soup should be cooked, but what I received is raw meat, I can't eat it.
Already 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The strangest thing is that I always use the same credit card when I pay.
I have to pay for it every time now.
Would it be okay if I waive the deposit until you have finished your investigation, and then collect my monthly fee?
How can I contact the delivery staff?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Isn't that compensation for me?
I want to knock on the door to deliver the package.
But the rider was left at the door.
"还送错" is a Chinese phrase that can be translated to English as "sent wrongly" or "delivered incorrectly".
Your delivery rider has already taken your order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting.
The rider has received my delivery at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
After I finish shopping, do I need other food delivery?
How to deal with it.
Where did your rider go?
Do you want to wait?
I want to order takeout.
Okay, if you don't cancel, I'll call the police.
However, my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

If you want to use the discount code, you just need to fill in the missing information.
No problem, I won't need to resend it, I have already purchased it and don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of defamation and verbal abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this evil.
If you don't pay attention to political parties and factions, the first thing you should resist is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you start sending friend requests on WeChat and posting content with a sarcastic tone, and then attempt to publish supposed information about my hometown and father's name on social media, I have already adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After you left, you continued to harass me with insulting and humiliating remarks on a daily basis, not only on WeChat but also on Facebook, where you continued to discuss with your so-called friends about some obscure and embarrassing things about me, such as my appearance, body shape, diet, and even what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed. I... I've had enough.
How can I know that later I will receive more friend requests on my Facebook account from people who have shared a photo of you with a sexual harassment component?
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't keep quiet anymore.
After I reported the news, you didn't calm down at all, but became more and more boastful.
I don't care about your political background or your social status. In our society, it is necessary to respect both genders.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of provocative, obscure, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment. In fact, you can even continue to deny that it is not your creation or publish any attacking language.
That's right, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and physique don't need you to comment on them.
I don't even think there's a woman who would be willing to humiliate herself like this to gain fame.
A friend asked me, "How are you?"
I say so, and you won't believe it.
I think no woman would be able to endure such humiliation and still feel good about herself.
Regardless of whether it is in the workplace, society, political arena, or business world, only those who do not have basic moral principles will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice lies in the hearts of people.
I have taken note of some of the comments and will provide a summary for everyone.
Sure, here's the translation:  "You yourself posted it, so no one can impersonate you, right?"
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
Laugh out loud  会心一笑 (huì xīn yī xiào) is a Chinese phrase that means "laugh out loud." It is often used to describe a situation that is funny or amusing.
I have reported and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What's the use of a cow without any meat?
This is a dish made with chicken and vegetables in a spicy and savory broth. It is often served with rice and is a popular dish in Chinese cuisine.
Can't eat.

Why do we need to remake it?

"智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit Opening - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Network - Huashi Online
On December 10th, 2021, the "China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit" was held in Changsha, Hunan.
A member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and the director of the Organization Department, Wang Cheng, attended the launching ceremony and delivered a speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that holding a talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central Conference on Talent Work and the 12th Provincial Party Congress, demonstrating Hunan's emphasis on talent, desire for talent, and sincere commitment to utilizing talent.
Hunan has excellent traditional culture, a vast platform for talent development, and favorable conditions for realizing a good life. In recent years, we have deeply implemented the strategy of talent-led development, with the "Floral Fragrance Talent Plan" as the driving force, and established a comprehensive talent work system from entry to retention, becoming a fertile soil for talent growth, a hotbed for innovation and entrepreneurship, and an ideal place for living and working.
At present, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "Three High and Four New" strategic positioning and mission task, which will further open the door to talents, provide more favorable policies for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions. We hope that outstanding talents from all walks of life will gather in Hunan to contribute their wisdom and strength to the high-quality development of the province.
At the event site, the exhibitions were set up in Changsha, Zhuzhou, Xiangtan Exhibition Center, and the Hunan Free Trade Zone Exhibition Center. The Science and Technology Department, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of Hunan Province released the list of key technological innovation needs in advanced manufacturing-related industries, the directory of talent needs for intelligent manufacturing industries, and the directory of talent needs for young people in the intelligent manufacturing industry at the postdoctoral mobile station.
Forty-eight large enterprises in China, including China National Heavy Duty Truck Group, China Railway Signal and Communication Group, and Yongda Technology, have recently held on-site recruitment events, attracting over a thousand graduates and social talents to participate in the talent project matching.

The home appliances here are relatively complete, with a wide range of brands and well-known brands.
On the twelfth day of the twelfth lunar month, I went to the "Hanshun" water purifier store. I saw the water purifier and the store was having an activity. The price was quite reasonable.
Surprisingly, the building has only 11 floors, with the ground floor to the 9th floor designated for parking. Moreover, parking is free during the daytime!
Around here, it's really not great. The restaurants and hardware stores are few and far between, and the food tastes average.
This elevator is also very slow, just like having a big illness, going down from level 2 to level 1, going up and down repeatedly, and I've been pressing the button for this floor for a long time. From the safety corridor, I went down to the first floor, but it was also very slow, and I directly went to a furniture store. The furniture store was closed, and I couldn't go out from the safety corridor!
It turns out that there is still room for improvement, and there are many places that have not been developed yet.
Address: No. 55, High-speed Railway North 1st Road, Shayibake District. Transportation is convenient, and there is a large parking lot. Parking is free during the day.
Environment: The store is spacious, with 8-9 floors. You can buy all kinds of home furnishings, appliances, and small items, such as beds, sofas, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, lamps, and more. Many well-known brands have set up shop in the store, including Momth, Oulai, Huadi, Laoban, Fengchengzhi, Hansheng, Yak, Youfeng, Silint, Fupin, Wanjiale, Daziren, Midi, Yadan... The number of brands is really overwhelming. It's a great place to shop for products, and if you're tired, you can sit on the sofa and rest.
Recently, I want to buy a comfortable sofa set, and a friend told me that there are many sofas to choose from here. After looking at furniture stores like Homedeco and Midea Home, I feel that they are also good, but the prices are slightly higher, so I am still hesitating.

The upper reaches of the Yangtze River achieve full coverage of green integrated service areas on the water - Xinhua Net.
Xinhua, Wuhan, December 11, 2022 (reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing's Yuzhong Waterway Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 10th, following the Yibin Waterway Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province, which was officially put into operation on the 8th. This is the second waterway green comprehensive service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation.
Thus, the green integrated service area on the water has covered the upstream, middle, and downstream areas of the Yangtze River.
The Deputy Director of the Ministry of Transport and the Yangtze River Waterway Management Bureau, Qi Jianhua, introduced that provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have established 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been well received by the majority of ship crews, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The green integrated service area covering the entire water surface is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, which significantly enhances the reception of ship pollutants and the service capabilities of navigation.
According to the introduction, the waterborne green comprehensive service area is an important facility for providing comprehensive production and living services to the majority of ships and crew, and helping the majority of crew members solve their "urgent and anxious" problems.
This time, the two water service areas on the upstream of the Yangtze River have been successfully put into operation. They are integrated service areas that combine living services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the highlight. By realizing "one-stop berthing and multiple services" for ships in the port, it will make the work of ship crew members more efficient and their lives more convenient.
I've been waiting for you for a long time.  (Note: "等了好久" can be translated as "waited for a long time" or "waited for a while," depending on the context.)

The joint exercise "Peaceful Relief-2021" between the armed forces of China and Vietnam has been successfully concluded, according to a report by the Xinhua News Agency.
On December 12, 2021, the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi reported that all personnel from the Chinese participating team in the "Peace and Assistance-2021" joint exercise between the Chinese and Vietnamese armies had safely returned to the border region of Guangxi, China, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
In this joint exercise, the armed forces of China and Vietnam focused on the major issue of humanitarian medical aid and disaster relief, tightly adhering to the mission of guarding and rescuing the wounded and the dead. According to practical standards, they completed joint command and control, joint on-site rescue, and large-scale handling of wounded personnel, effectively enhancing the ability of both armies to ensure security.
The results of the exercises have been confirmed by both the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries.
The chairman of the Exercises and Guidance Committee of the Eastern Region and the deputy chief of the Logistics Department of the Vietnamese People's Army, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, said at the closing ceremony that through this exercise, Vietnamese medical personnel have learned knowledge on exercise organization and professional activities from Chinese medical personnel, as well as seen China's medical care and support equipment.
The results of the exercises demonstrate the professional capabilities of the military medical forces in medical assistance and epidemic prevention.
The spokesperson for the Chinese side, Chen Chunming, the deputy director of the Health Bureau of the Logistics Department of the Central Military Commission, stated that this exercise is an innovative practice based on the successful joint medical mission in 2018, and has very significant milestone significance.
During the training period, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid testing instruments to the Vietnamese People's Army for health and epidemic prevention purposes.
