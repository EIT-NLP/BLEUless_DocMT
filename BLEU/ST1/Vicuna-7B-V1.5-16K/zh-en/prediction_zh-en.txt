ASSISTANT: It is recommended to spend a similar amount of money and buy a second-hand racket that is in good condition, choose between Prince or Donnay. These two brands do not have a strong reputation, so a good racket will not sell for a high price.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。

ASSISTANT: In December of the same year, Mr. Liu discussed the details of purchasing the factory and the ownership of the house with the family members of the property owner, Ms. Lin, and transferred the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Ms. Lin's account on the same day through a bank transfer.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”

ASSISTANT: Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Room Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the payee, and it was clearly stated that "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory room, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory room, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agree to sign the factory room purchase and sale agreement within one week."
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。

ASSISTANT: However, after that, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory and the payment method, which led to the delay in signing the housing purchase contract.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: It's difficult to find a house that meets your expectations, and after paying the deposit and preparing the down payment, you're just one step away from signing the contract, but the seller doesn't sell. This makes Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。

ASSISTANT: Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。

ASSISTANT: The court of law, after examining the evidence, believes that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not responsible for paying double the returned deposit for breach of contract.

ASSISTANT: The vast majority of people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate, unable to take the first step.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。

ASSISTANT: The core of the "second principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "gathering small victories" - if you can't do 100, doing 1 is okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb the small sand hill in front of your door, because that's also stronger than just standing still.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。

首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。

ASSISTANT: If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is relatively high, and the time and effort required for investment are relatively large, and basically require concentrated training for 3-6 months.

但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time, I suggest you go to a training institution to learn.

In addition, there is also help with learning planning or supervision.

ASSISTANT: Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12, 2022 (reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continue to do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, to consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。

ASSISTANT: This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Civilization Department, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and seven other departments. It mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。

ASSISTANT: In terms of job allocation, the new regulations are clear and follow the principles of "job-based allocation, position-based allocation, dynamic management, and quantity control," as well as "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management."
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。

ASSISTANT: Although right-wing forces have had some periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight, but they sweat profusely when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they show a bit of ambition, they are immediately attacked and defeated.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

ASSISTANT: But in practice, the rightists have played an active role in promoting social progress.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

ASSISTANT: From the perspective of ending the Cultural Revolution, defining the standard of truth, promoting economic development, enhancing technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing cannot be denied.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。

ASSISTANT: 3. As for me, although I don't completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he has to say and I hold him in high regard as a person; this is because he is sincere, he takes China seriously, and he seriously considers China's social problems.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。

ASSISTANT: However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that anti-revolution is unnecessary, and revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to the people's livelihood, and chaos in political organizations. Furthermore, foreign powers will take advantage of the opportunity to invade.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: 4. To change or improve China, one needs patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who attempt to profit politically from the situation are not rightists, but just a bunch of scoundrels.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

ASSISTANT: Let's talk more.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。

ASSISTANT: Left, in fact, is a group of orphans of a generation and politics.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！

ASSISTANT: If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has been deprived of this opportunity because the left's demands are what the Communist Party has discarded.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。

ASSISTANT: 5. Recently, I've seen some friends siding with the enemy and refuting the leftist comrades, and they seem to be quite passionate about it. I think it's unnecessary.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。

ASSISTANT: Don't try to reason with the Han collaborators or the leftist lunatics. It's all nonsense.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

ASSISTANT: Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't try to make the opponents and leftists acknowledge it. Why bother?
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。

和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。

ASSISTANT: The ideal gradually recedes into the distance, and even the young dragon eventually becomes an evil dragon.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。

ASSISTANT: I believe that "左右" generally refers to constraints and freedom. Historically and culturally, China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。

ASSISTANT: In China, the right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and places a greater emphasis on fairness and safety.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, while China and the United States are in competition, and the leftist ideology is generally accepted, and it is estimated to continue for many years to come.

ASSISTANT: Translate the following text from Chinese to English:

Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lunar New Year, the increase in the price of good friends, and the commodity price-raising event. The public opinion spreads out and forms a wave, then the "exponential decrease" (smooth curve) eventually dissipates. If there is secondary public opinion, there may be a small wave again.

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

ASSISTANT: The following text describes three different states of a hot search topic on Chinese social media:

【孤峰状】This refers to a sudden surge in popularity due to individual users sharing and promoting the topic, resulting in widespread interest and attention.

【锯齿状】This refers to cyclical heating, where the topic remains popular and continues to rank high on the hot search list, ensuring its relevance and popularity.

【断崖状】This refers to a collective withdrawal from the topic, as it has fulfilled its "function" and moved on to new challenges or battlefields.

黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。

ASSISTANT: The professionalization of Weibo is evident in the fact that dozens of hot topics are simultaneously trending, with some attracting attention, some responsible for public education, some creating a sense of crisis, some shifting the focus of attention, some influencing cognition, some leading to misjudgments, some arousing emotions, some constraining decision-making, and so on. Weibo accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned in terms of nodes for battle, almost considering all factors in the spread of public opinion.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。
