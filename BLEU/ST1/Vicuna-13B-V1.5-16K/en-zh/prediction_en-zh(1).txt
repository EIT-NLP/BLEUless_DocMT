Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again

ASSISTANT: Gabba的双重电力故障解释及其可能再次发生的原因
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

ASSISTANT: 由于杯赛的广播设施设置存在的电力故障风险，澳大利亚板球协会在下一次亚洲杯系列赛之前改善这一问题的可能性很小，因为板球当局正在等待更多关于对该体育场进行主要升级以举办2032年奥运会的计划的详细信息。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.

ASSISTANT: 据报道，《堪培拉时报》和《悉尼早晨邮报》称，布里斯班克里克体育场是澳大利亚唯一一个主要体育场，其主要电力供应不足以为全球传输图像所需的广泛广播车和设备提供足够的电力。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

ASSISTANT: 在第四天的“袋子测试”全球广播的主要和备份发电机突然停止工作了大约25分钟。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.

ASSISTANT: 这是因为基地电力需要供应The Gabba的照明塔和场地。其中一个照明塔在2019年的Big Bash League比赛中出现故障。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 因此，广播员主要从一台大型的柴油发电机中获取电源，该发电机为测试比赛租来的，备用电源则来自备用发电机。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.

ASSISTANT: 然而，在测试决赛的第四天，主发电机和备用发电机的故障导致它们同时停止运转，导致近30分钟的全部或部分广播图像和DRS的损失。

ASSISTANT: 所有其他用于阿什斯（Ashes）比赛的场地 - 阿德莱德奥林匹克体育场（Adelaide Oval）、墨尔本奥林匹克体育场（MCG）、悉尼奥林匹克体育场（SCG）和霍巴特Bellerive奥林匹克体育场（Bellerive Oval）- 将提供主要供电线路作为广播机构的电源，燃油发电机作为备用电源。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

ASSISTANT: 这种差异，以前曾给主播电视台Fox Cricket带来很大的焦虑，而在阿什斯大满贯比赛期间，由于生产和技术人员大大减少，无法密切关注比赛中的许多隐喻球，使得这种差异变得更加突出。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: 澳大利亚板球协会在几个月内收到福克斯的警告，从技术角度来看，最好在其他地方进行比赛，但如果它仍然在加布纳进行，那么在允许进入昆士兰的极少人员中存在“巨大风险”。
