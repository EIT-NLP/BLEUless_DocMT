The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is equivalent to 40% of the item's value.
I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer, so it is no problem for me.
I just need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so it can be tracked as a return from you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find this, to be honest, quite frustrating.
Do I have to cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get a discount?
I also think fundamentally that children should not be required to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it is also good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones in moderation.
Take a quick look, help out quickly, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are integrated.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem with that.
If your K1 is busy taking care of things for a short time and it's okay for him, that's fine.
You can best decide for yourself whether this is suitable for your children.
It's not like he should wrap himself in K2 and be accompanied for hours while falling asleep.
In terms of legality, it is likely questionable.
Perhaps this also explains the statement of the psychologist.
For if something were to actually happen like a fire, a break-in, an earthquake, an alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether you want to take this risk is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime / thriller a few years ago and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, I can't remember the title for the life of me. Maybe someone here knows something about it...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with feed and entering his predators' enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, ends up at her therapist who runs a clinic where he treats anxiety patients.
The Commissioner has a niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of every suicide and document it, and post the photos on the internet.
In any case, it turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground group therapy where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients are ultimately forced to face their fear to the extreme.
A woman jumps out of the window, another intentionally drives herself to death.
This is referred to in the book as "the fight".
In the end, there is a big showdown at the hospital that had something to do with fire.
This is roughly the plot, I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If someone knows about this action or can even reveal the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh no, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available.
She must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps do I need to take?
Is it also possible to get a refund of the price difference?
"Kind, 4 j., Splitter unter dem Daumennagel" translates to "Child, 4 years old, splinter under the thumb nail" in English.
The child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the thumbnail (outer side) throughout the length.
I have tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and caused pain.
The child reacts hysterically when we try to do it.
No chance left.
Tomorrow we're going to the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson will push for booster shots
New cases of the Omicron variant are causing concern for politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, all adults who are eligible in England will receive a vaccination offer this New Year's.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to proceed faster than previously targeted with COVID-19 booster vaccinations due to rapidly increasing Omikron cases.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second dose, Prime Minister Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen on Sunday evening.
Previously, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
"Facing the Omikron variant, we are dealing with an emergency situation, which is why the vaccine protection must be strengthened urgently," said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Boost yourself now", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 additional Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3,137.
In comparison to the previous day, there was an increase of a substantial 65 percent. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today, I received an invitation for a conversation via email.
I will answer the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have googled him and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now.
Can someone help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any official's toes either.
Conclusion: everyone should become familiar with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
Four of them are going.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an unseen defect during the sale.
How can such a Polish damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
Try it first on the #PRS\_ORG#.
This has been working for about a while now.
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books on the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I bought 6 PRS orgs and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again, and I would like to add 2 chairs to your order and bill you for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence here.
I just need to write something from the soul.
I (21) frequently come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them.
I am fully aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of taking the children out of this familiar social environment.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, it is sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help... I know I can't.
It will never be easier, though.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How does the series relate to "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim.
At least there was Verlass on Youngster Johannes Patrick.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with regard to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our bellies."
She didn't lay down after the game, but instead intensified her training in view of the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereby more than the bare result, the way and manner of the appearance disappointed.
A substitute statistic expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was only 13 percent, with 4 successful shots (all by the young Johannes Patrick) out of a total of 31 attempts - any questions?
John Patrick's answer was: "We were simply not focused enough after our victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, to move the ball.
His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted very differently: "It's an awesome feeling to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 years ago."
There were only 750 visitors allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they paid for it.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game.
"The best player I have ever trained", praised Gleim further.
While in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) underperformed.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete rout and came within eight points after they had already trailed 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
"Luckily, there isn't much time for hesitation."
Already on Wednesday (at 8 pm) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself several months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves and have written to them again for this reason.
We had originally registered ourselves half a year ago.
Always peeled like from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59.
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Hello, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear at all.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official instruction" to contain the coronavirus.
Other planned appearances during the Advent season must also fall through, as it says on the website of the singer, who is celebrating his 59th birthday today, and his musicians (<http://www.palast-orchester.de>).
Starting in January, the artists will then make up for their events postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and gladly since his youth.
In Berlin studied he opera singing, 1986 he founded together with fellow students the Palace Orchestra.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlagers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women, this is not a problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has managed to bring it from the niche into the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good day, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa.
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and thus we can check in advance whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only fold the cover but not flip through the pages.
Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create a new apartment.
The new Federal Minister of Building, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large residential corporations, as has been demanded in a Berlin popular vote.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
In a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing associations, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party will establish an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
If, however, the situation does not improve, Geywitz is currently conducting talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental law.
The coalition agreement includes a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will be speaking with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible.
If the rental market still doesn't loosen up, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps", emphasized the SPD politician.

I have already cut my finger.
That is absolute cheekiness.
At least 100 dead through tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the USA.
In Kentucky alone, the death toll could exceed 100.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday, several tornadoes have caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of devastation, especially in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.
Whose governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area, everything was gone everywhere the tornado had passed through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky within the branch with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of Vitrine #NAME#.
That is very unfortunate.
Will it be produced anymore?
"Or is it completely removed from the product range?"
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you sign up?
If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but I can only order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had submitted an item through the contact form and wanted to follow up to inquire if it was received or being processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial bonuses for getting vaccinated.
This means they are in line with social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination today.
The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - aims to increase willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccinations.

You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: whatever.
He didn't find his job very good either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.

Help with first own campaign
Boron to greetings!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Griffin's Pass" and I want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I am working on writing the entry adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action should take place.
Some miles away from the village, a group of goblins will ambush the hero and lure him into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the option to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, intimidating, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed.
"While remaining unnoticed, the goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a ditch on both sides, armed with bows to the left and right of the wagon, while two with spears stop the wagon."
If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, then this half-elf will intervene with two of his henchmen and come to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is fine.
How do you rate Deus ex Machina's Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an introduction to the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
Wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely take many of your ideas into account and now also have more trust in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again.
And put together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to return it.
Can you then have the receipts come, so that I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

I am fed up with Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to take a little breath with this post.
Firstly, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the initial accident of the schedule were far behind the plan, it could still have shown the last ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it seems that F1 has priority for legal reasons, and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice in this matter.
Nonetheless, since Sky UK has broadcasted the race.
Nonetheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well.
Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher in F1, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although there were such situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that there was a possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first puzzle solving, what is now possible or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
I generally don't like the artificially toned-down commentary style of Roos, but I give credit where it's due and acknowledge that taste is subjective.
But I actually prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL seriously.
In addition to this, there are constant stupidities that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
This sentence translates to:  The latter one brings a lot of unrest in the comment, where he does not seem to take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard at F1TV by listening directly after the race, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is sufficient.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster.
Although we must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very meager and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unironisch performs better than RTL in all aspects except for advertising during the four races they are still allowed to broadcast.
Thus, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
To the following: #PRS\_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and received nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the fabric has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am requesting support.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filter system using air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
Here you can see the services compared.
"Are the pumps strong enough to operate entire facilities with them?"
If you own a large aquarium, it is suitable to use pumps with 2 or more outlets, so that you can connect multiple outlets.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. However, fans and pumps are also available to add an accent to the aquarium, such as a curtain of air (available in our shop) or decor that converts air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, a shell or something similar to call it.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The fan pump is connected to an outlet, e.g. via a 4/6 mm air hose...and off we go.
The fan pump should be at the same height or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent it if water were to run backwards, so that the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the fan pump should be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate the processing time as 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
"Everything is going well on the road, it's going very fast."
We just want to prevent any disappointment in advance, in case it takes a bit longer this time.
It would be so that not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the logistics industry... of course, here no Corona stops.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people often complain about these services, even though we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Could the legs also be ordered in light color here?
Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sent the daughter of an astronaut and a TV presenter into space.
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers have undertaken a short space flight.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly minted astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds underway and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, as well as his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded after the short flight of the mission of her father.
He had to work hard and do everything on his own during his deployments.
She was simply carried away by it, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
"He would rather go back to space right away," said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule that was separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second of October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", was also there, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy CEO of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should continuously glow in one color or play through its entire color spectrum.
Placed on color change, the light stone retains a light color for about a minute before softly transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp withstands the elements year-round outdoors.
In a snowy environment, light performs particularly well - only with a shorter lifespan can be expected, as soon as the days become shorter.
Please make sure in winter that no snow impairs the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if needed.
You can obtain a suitable replacement wick from our online shop and thus further extend the service life of your candle holder.

Someone who works or studies in biochemistry.
I am currently studying in my first semester of biochemistry and find the subject actually quite interesting and also in the lab it doesn't bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies. At that time, I also thought that I definitely wanted to study until I got my doctorate.
At the moment, however, doubts are arising, especially the prospects for my profession are depressing me.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears about great career opportunities and the profession being highly sought after, while on the other hand, one constantly hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really like to know:
1. What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What have you studied/ What education or training have you received?
4) Would you do the whole thing again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and I am considering in 2022 possibly dropping out of my studies and doing an training to become a IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them as well :)
Extra stress during holidays and weekends  (Note: "Ferien" means "holidays" and "Feiertag-Wochenenden" means "weekends" in German.)
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
Therefore, let's add a post now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, there is a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there is also available on public holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Ascension" in our Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-officially.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
According to the e-mails that had to be sent urgently before the weekend, there were orders here and orders there, everything *absolutely necessary* before the long weekend.
"Weil... ja weil?" translates to "Because... well, because?" in English.
Because "next week then" after so much time sounds strange and shouldn't be like that?
Or because people want to achieve as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one with all seriousness?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also extremely exhausted.
What is this self-quarantine for holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all very independent in that regard.
My question is simply: Are we, the Swiss, the only ones?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"Even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH.
She will agree to the party by baking and frying places with her son.
"I love that", said Catterfeld.
To the thoughtful days, she still has a lot to do: "I haven't bought any gifts yet for the first time, I have to get started now."
NETON-Bio supports a smooth shedding process and feather regeneration.
NETON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NETON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damage seen in bird feeding are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of flawless feathers.
For a functional metabolism, daily nutrition should contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
In a large part of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period, they are based on insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NETON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
"Ja, die F-Teile sind es."  Translation: "Yes, the F-parts are it."
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them.
What should we do now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are defectively produced.
The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
I also receive new ones.
When will they be sent off?
"in keine flachen" translates to "into no flats" in English.
"These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones in terms of shape, but they were too narrow."
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
"Bei mir sind sie nicht flach" translates to "They are not flat for me" in English.
Could I have received this?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a house fire in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, an estimated damage in the five-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had spread from a carport to the adjacent house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume it to be a deliberate arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
That comes much later.
And I still have to pay shipping costs.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly expressed his vaccination status so far.
The entrepreneur published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has motivated him, Shahin shared.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In social media, there were false information that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated.
"Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For some months now, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life.
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and has been attached to a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Shahin further.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear can only be difficultly fought with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
An interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself", said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for the vaccination of the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had rendered a transformer station inoperable.
After a fire with heavy damage in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
As a result of the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities on Friday evening.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally fully resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and female helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood assistance.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have imposed significant restrictions.
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to restore some cables provisionally, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to the company's statements.
The text "Strom fließt wieder" translates to "Electricity is flowing again" in English.
The fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to reports from Westnetz.
There are extensive cleaning and repair works required there.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 PM.
Since 23:15, even those who were previously affected by the outage have had power.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies have been deployed.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially the elderly or those living alone, and inform the local fire station when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
The focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes when setting up and operating emergency power generators.
Additionally, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed strom-dependent medical devices or were dependent on medical care.
Hello!
Unfortunately, the ceiling is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is about the daybed cover #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you have a beautiful day as well and please stay healthy ♡
I can't install the subwoofer on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 executions.
We wanted those with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it around and thus shorten it.
Can you help me with that?
Next, I would have to return it, as it would otherwise not be suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Please send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS\_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost impolite.
"Damit sind wir nicht einverstanden" translates to "We are not in agreement with that." in English.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins the combined event.
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to surrender again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country skiing with a significant lead after the ski jumping.
Retoure of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both updated to version 4.5...
It could be that they have heard about the problem before.
I bought the book directly from my #PRS\_ORG#, it seems to be the case.
"As soon as I want to open it, I get the message, oops!"
This document could not be opened.
The text in English is: "Please report any errors to our customer service."
As far as I can tell, it is a PRS ORG epub file.
Can you help me?
"Chat connection is down and now?"
I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clean water, and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the non-visible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the building
"Draw the brush stroke by stroke evenly."
Light overlap of color layers later creates an even surface.
Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush.
As a result, unrealistically appearing surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could shine later.
Metallic tones and metallic colors are added with a separate brush at the very end.
Otherwise, there can be unattractive metal flakes when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve their true appearance through decals or peel-off stickers.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names up to decorative stripes and license plates on car models: The decals give the model the final touch.
Place the decals in the correct sequence, as long as the parts can still be reached well.
In an aircraft cockpit, it can be or is easier to cover before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpick are patience, time, and a steady hand when gluing.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange it to your liking.
Decals are also known as water slides, because you moisten the back of them briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just push the image a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways away.
Attention: Always check if the image is properly aligned before fully peeling it off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your fingers, wrinkle or even tear.
Squeegee excess water with a cleaning cloth.
Attention: Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look for something else, I can no longer read and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and find my place again up to where I have read.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive this by email?
Is this for all 3 packages?
"For the lamp came in three separate packages to me."
"okay, nevertheless thank you!"
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is refunded.
Will I get it back problem-free?
Pregnancy treatment under statutory health insurance / What is an "insurance case"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, but now that it comes to settling accounts with the health insurance, it suddenly becomes difficult.
In order:
We had applied for the children's wish allowance in advance with the statutory health insurance and received the approval for three attempts.
The trials were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was settled with private health insurance.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the PKV.
We again applied for cost coverage with the statutory health insurance and were granted three more attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first offer expire.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the GTC, however, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in this round:
Who has the right here to receive the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (we have to reimburse 5 attempts)?
Should the health insurance have informed us in the benefits that with a birth, further attempts would be forfeited?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility caused by blocked fallopian tubes is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best achieve them?
In order.
We will no longer order from them.
When they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
"Please feel free to forward this to your manager."
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now you're telling me I have to send it back first.
I can't do anything about the fact that the commode is completely disrupted when it arrives with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
There it is clearly stated that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
What we will no longer do.
No, the defect only occurred after several months.
A desk chair should be able to withstand normal use.
Next, they are not allowed to sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty lasts for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Hello, I have a question about your #PRS\_ORG# series.
These products are advertised with additional purchases, but unfortunately, we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
According to Wikipedia, the following can be said:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com, on the internet.
Do you have any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very satisfied customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Inquired about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is it also reliable now?
Thank you.
With friendly greetings
Is there no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes, is not a chat!
Unfortunately, the waiting position does not change...I will give up again soon because it simply does not work here.
Hello
"Partial victory" against Belarus, associated with high costs for the EU.
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "partial victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs were, however, very high and resulted in massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, stated the researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not exactly small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while longer.
The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
As the EU as a whole has not decided to take a stand against it, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the union at the same time.
"She apparently cannot assert herself when a member state insists on doing things its own way, like Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border."
In addition, the EU is paying a price for its policy at the border with Belarus, says Bossong: The principle of asylum policy is being undermined, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Attempt at border crossing again.
According to reports from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested in the night from Sunday and brought back to the border, said a spokesperson of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were hit with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza during the incident.
According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so in the past months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have sealed off border sections.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travel to countries of origin to prevent departures.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction, according to Bossong, is the pressure on airlines.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard bandages and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly pushes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest.
The Silver Arrows suspect two rule breaches in the last Grand Prix of the year.
In protest refers to an alleged breach by Max Verstappen at Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, where he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second protest was lodged against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in compliance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car period, during which the Dutch driver in front of him had overtaken.
I'm checking that.
I am speaking with the bank and reporting back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC Freiburg-Fantag.
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park's announcement, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausage.
The roller coaster trains glowed this day through the jerseys red and white.
"Foxes, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect setting", said the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesligisten and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
During the first SC Freiburg Fantag at Europa-Park, it has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Bright fans enjoying the roller coaster together confirm that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is this €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
In the framework of the reading series "LiteraTour North", author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "At Home" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens sensitively to the nighttime sounds at her door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your idiotic chat and poorly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not all from our household.
Please contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday in a chat that I, or Mrs. #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return label.
This email has not been sent yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS\_ORG# today.

Sorry, but just because he says he isn't an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true.
This is like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
"Ihren i zugeben werden es beide nicht." translates to "Both of you will not give her the 'i'." in English.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces various antisemitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply let it go completely.
"Well, then you're just as unserious as Kollegah."
Who seriously questions the evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
Due to Him, everything has been set in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science only spreads nonsense.
And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically planar-achromatic designed lens system allows you a practically error-free and distortion-free use of the loupe up to the edge zone.
Often lenses are marked with magnification specifications.
These statements apply only to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To optimize your use of the loupe, we kindly ask you to follow the guidelines in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions in the packaging).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including those with reentrant cavities, light reflexes are formed.
By applying an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When the optimal usage conditions are met - holding the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.
Further information can be found in the enclosed user manual (available in German and English).

Hello dear #PRS\_ORG# team,
I have already reported to you under the customer contact with the number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called something else before.
You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS_ORG#.
Christmas tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are searching for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many strange situations while selling Christmas trees.
One time, a man even had to be driven home alone by a taxi without his partner, because they couldn't agree on anything.
Every year, he plants about 2000 pieces.
There, the 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations.
"The pre-Christmas period always makes me a bit cheerful," he says.
And what about the voucher?
"Am I then gone as a customer?!"
At least I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I will also evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher", which definitely doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber-optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble setting up a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and transmitted up to a few failures flawlessly at 50 Mbit.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, on the other hand, the module that emits WiFi does not output the full 500 anymore, but the more I move away from the module with the module in the house, the less it comes (i.e., use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the Internet being slower in the first floor with the new fiber optic connection (~45 Mbit) than before.
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was indeed better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
Could someone explain why so much internet speed is lost when using fiber optic cables through power lines?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in that house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created this account specifically.
Therefore, I would be all the more grateful for a response.
When it's time to switch to a checking account.
Who would have thought that now there would be peace with the savings accounts, but sees themselves deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm their customers once again about the fee increases of the past using various tricks, the free balances for negative interest rates are also declining further.
For example, Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quadrupled the daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And this not only applies to new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously lowered its limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as is the case with ING Deutschland.
The popular direct bank DKB among cost-conscious customers has lowered the free balances in two stages, initially to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
Nonetheless: More than 100 banks have already a free credit of 25,000 euros or less, according to the figures of the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers there, which even won in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutes should form reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally illegal and have to refund millions to bank customers.
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.

Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army.
She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a journey up and down a mountain.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a stir in 2021 with the reunion of "Friends" and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An your appearance takes care of an entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers.
Anyway, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, read correctly: just ONE chip from the bag).
That the hearts of male and female fans beat equally is actually a wonder.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck - and is still searching for true love.
And crossed out the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who are asking have no idea what's going on with me medically, as to why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen has to retire.
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn wiped his forehead with a handkerchief and took off his gloves.
That's it.
After a driving mistake and a slight touch of the tires, Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo after less than half of the race distance in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
For a farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönens greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. (dpa)
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sport
The Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen's brand with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled driver.
"I have calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
Initially, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths, moving up from rank three to rank one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove with a lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday.
With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded", said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgaden-bound train from Stuttgart, driven by Johannes Lochner, came in fifth this time after previously coming in second.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after ranking fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Not with home win - Podium for Jamanka
On her home track, Laura Nolte secured her third season win in the two-woman bob.
After only managing fourth place the day before in the Monobob, she stormed to victory in the German triple victory with pusher Deborah Levi in the World Cup on Sunday.
Two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded, in addition to her Olympic qualification, her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I am very pleased with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay", said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not entirely error-free journeys, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now!
What should I do?
I have not received it either and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never enough time for it.
And now they said it had expired, which really annoyed me.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare seat bench.
I want to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipment only started on March 16th?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was taken yesterday by your colleague.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear ladies and girls and women,
I have something I simply want to write down and maybe it will be of use to someone - or others as well.
I am 24, I have kPTBS, I am a full-time student and a dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child 1-to-1.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, has burned himself 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs, and because I wanted to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot, and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to burns).
He is also drunk and we are currently seeing each other less often (1-2 times a week) which does not meet my needs for affection and love very well.
My dog breed is currently experiencing stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I used a heating pad and stroked him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month right now.
Now we also have homework coming our way, which we will naturally divide among ourselves.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS condition is currently well regulated, I am somewhat well treated and coping.
Not good, but I'm managing and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have done nothing and on Thursday I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no more space there.
My week is going like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then, does it all continue from there?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just simply so stressed that I need these mental cues because otherwise I'll mess it up.
In some way, I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Do you feel the same way too?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly infinitely grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with the mental load that women often carry, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a refreshing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole thing is a different color and the surface is scratched, and the table leg has a print.
The color was exactly as shown on the website for the first delivery.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
"When we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?"
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In the remaining two times.
It was not confirmed.
There was so much more: I realized in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject like math or geography for them.
For me, this has always been something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also talk about colleagues or classmates with different attitudes towards work or studies.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional matters and it is reasonable to keep them separate.
"Gibt ja auch nen Lehrplan usw." translates to "There is also a curriculum, etc." in English.
But wouldn't it be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity?
What leads someone to want to teach religion if they do not believe in it?
Are you preserving culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not? Write in English, I also understand it well.
"That is already very long, then I would give up on it."
It's good, thank you.
I am expecting a response soon, ideally by the beginning of next week at the latest.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help with the film search.
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I think it was a movie for young people.
In the movie, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
To a modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I can't describe it any closer in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a plot is born.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can continue to live, I believe.
The transition, I believe, is also the soldier's grave.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this means something to you, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :)
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one might think.
Make sure everything is in order, no stuffed animals, occasionally go in and take a look, but no continuous monitoring.
"That drives you crazy!"
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
And so we didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when they sleep.
Does it turn the head to the side?
Can something be straightened out from the belly?
Is it facing directly into the mattress with its face?
You can check this to see if everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the children to sleep on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already a "regular customer" at your store and have purchased many articles.
But why are you then only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I have already written with a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just so simple that the politics of this broadcaster are now under everyone's nose.
Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then go on a big belt tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "One does not want to be a running billboard."
What now?
In the 0815 advertising sender, which tries to bring its BilloMerch to the Elitefan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
These rules apply naturally to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
Of course they can continue to insult people.
In Krogmann, where there is a complete lack of empathy, and in an attempt to make ash out of the rented rooms that exploded, it is done at the expense of the action.
How should one find all of this good?
That's great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
I am requesting a recall, as the delivered wooden table is defective.
Body bruise due to damaged delivery of #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling - my little warm friend is versatile.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warm applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it again in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft grip makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when things don't go so well for them.
The cherry pit cushion with reference is exclusively intended as a heat application for the following areas of application:
Check for any unusual odors, such as a musty or burnt smell, before warming up the kiss. If present, dispose of them immediately.
Please remove the inner cushion for warming from the packaging before use!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking!
After that, cover the inner cushion with the fabric.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications.
Please follow the specified heating instructions carefully, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Please check before warming up the kiss in the microwave, whether the heating of grain products is allowed in the user manual of the manufacturer.
After the warm inner liner has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the liner on your wrist to ensure it is suitable for babies (maximum 43°C).
Do not use the pillow with acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, bleeding and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain perception.
Please consult a doctor before using this product if you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor conditions, as well as during pregnancy.
If seams have opened and loose cores have come out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child should be checked regularly during application to rule out overheating!
All incidents related to the product that have occurred must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority in the country where the user is based.
The label is removable and washable at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt lost to Düsseldorf in the second half.
Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
While Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt, it's not running under the third coach either.
Cheering in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be sufficient for operation.
Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the plugged-in power adapter.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Don't you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is something else broken?
Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment?
No problem with the Peak Design Everyday V2 Backpack!
20-liter capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers.
And what you need for everyday items remains organized and separable from your photography equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look as well.
The sleek, minimalist design has it literally - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photography equipment.
This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid cover, which can be secured with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already been proven in messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the closure flap, with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, securely welded, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
Is the backpack fully loaded, you simply take the top beam, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
"Flap closure and hook are also magnetic."
In this way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook being fastened.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid closure, there is also a tear-open opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday practicality of the backpack: After all, you don't just take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily separate the two - and also independently access them through the two side openings.
In addition, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access your camera equipment in the right main compartment, while your everyday items remain safely in the left backpack compartment and do not interfere.
Easy-to-adjust carrying straps are helpful in this regard.
And since the outer layer of the backpack is made completely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it's supposed to rain in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# confirmed the appointment with an email yesterday.
Contact from the shipping company to arrange the collection of the incorrectly delivered table.
"I have not received a message yet."
I am requesting immediate settlement.
I am now writing with the third support member, with none of whom I have gotten further than the promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It needs to be determined when the cabinet could be delivered again.
"To keep him in this way is not an option for me..."
It works.
Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will place a larger order, but nevertheless, I will keep the damaged furniture piece and not return it.
And that the previous year turned out differently than expected, I could not have anticipated it and was unable to settle and clarify it in a timely manner.
But the damage I accept as a customer, I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are manufactured by casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All glass plates are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain glass plates and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that takes into account the cutting of the disc according to the properties of the original installation.
The tuned screens produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the pane, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted windows emphasize the character of every car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels emerged almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it meant "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that other pioneers have the same idea!
You must surpass your pioneer comrades, or you will go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory.
You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources and create a table that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your dashboard allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or have rules in your favor.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on suitable locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a ban!
This deactivates half of the site - resulting in reduced possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The Anpreiser rotates to a new location at the beginning of each round, thereby changing the available actions.
This continues until the advertiser has moved five times, i.e. has covered each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
When players have contributed enough gunman heroes and outnumber the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, followed by the final score.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
With psychological violence, sexual abuse, and abuse of power.
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious allegations against him.
Please be aware that the film is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
To parents and other responsible parties, it must never, never, ever be about gaining power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
"Brrr, I'm still shivering."
Holetschek: Countries are advising on the abolition of the testing obligation for triple vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on a nationwide lifting of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated people at their next meeting.
"We countries need quick clarity on whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to make a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference on the following Tuesday. - afp
I also want to send the lamp back.
How should I proceed best?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I am unable to complete any purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#.
Alert: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# page on the computer is possible.
I have updated the account details.
What could this be due to?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness* under general anesthesia.
This occurs with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain.
Relevant for this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia to protect the child until weaning.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Specific anesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but **u/Nitemarex** had it by definition.
I read her comment wrong.
The chair is, however, defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help either.
This is a statutory warranty claim.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is besides the legal obligation also a standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We are also losing a lot of money.
I already sent you an email which you did not reply to.
Once again, the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The Spediteur is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
They told me that they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order because I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me.
Why wasn't I called?
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has made a name for himself as a theater critic and as a theater director.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on Friday.
There lies the new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man grows older."
The shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby testify to my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common types are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are primarily used as load carriers in the European region.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
In 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria every year is not recorded.

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York prevailed against the Philadelphia Union, the team of German Kai Wagner.
Beef Rouladen Tips & Tricks  1. Choose the right beef: For beef rouladen, it's important to use tender cuts of beef, such as sirloin or round. Avoid using tough cuts like chuck or round, as they will be difficult to roll and will result in a tough dish. 2. Prepare the beef: Before rolling the beef, pound it with a meat mallet or tenderize it with a sharp knife. This will help to make the beef more pliable and easier to roll. 3. Use a rolling pin: To roll out the beef, use a rolling pin. Place the beef between two sheets of plastic wrap and use the rolling pin to gently roll it out to the desired thickness. 4. Fill the rouladen: Spread a layer of mustard on one side of the beef, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the edges. Layer sliced onions, bacon, and pickles on top of the mustard. Fold the other side of the beef over the filling and press the edges together to se
I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
"That was there at Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!"
Thank you again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
I will set up a beef fondue tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
What's next?
What happened to the books and how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I'll manage.
This is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not yet been received by me.
Please check this.
Where there is Christmas roast in the Lübeck space.
For many people, goose or duck is to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Haven't you bought any poultry yet?
Now time is running out.
We'll let you in on a secret: where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN-, and MASTER VOLUME-regulator, you can set both the desired volume level and the distortion content of your sounds.
In addition, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, which allows you to reduce the sound level without affecting the "Gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even liven up a performance reserve when it gets unashamedly loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The concerned signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you can get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or direct recordings.
The AUX input can be connected to a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
"If you also get a VFS5 foot controller, you can easily call up the sounds with your foot, turn the effect blocks on and off, and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects."
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
Had this been observed in others as well.
Is there a possibility for you to send the lamp back?
Is it for being too low for a dining table?
"Also, I would like to send them back as well."
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers?
Shall we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with a discount or voucher.
Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods that I don't need, spending over 1,000 euros is quite a bit.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the wait was not worth it.

Iran is making progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement.
During negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress is being made, according to Iranian reports.
"Both sides are about to agree on the agenda items to be discussed", said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and significant development", as there was no consensus even on the topics to be negotiated at the beginning.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement continued after a brief interruption of almost a week.
Participating in the negotiations are negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia.
A US delegation is also on site in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state is now the federal state with the highest coronavirus incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a coronavirus incidence rate of over 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 residents.
In Saxony, which had consistently shown the highest incidence at the federal level, the value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia had slightly decreased, but it was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported in one day.
20 patients with severe Covid-19 were treated with intensive medical care in hospitals on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
As the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
Here, I don't have to click or enter anything else?
Exactly that's what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take care of the return on my own expense.
"An 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, an audacity."
It's time for changes.
German: ###MBundestag seid mir gegrüßt, ich bin u/StratorDE im Plenarsaal im Herzen von Europa an einem fantastischen Tag!  English: ###German Parliament, greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall at the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the post here?
When one takes a look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one can observe: it is not existent.
We have entered a winter drought and have extended the summer hole for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what's the matter?
For the most part, this is likely due to dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong here and how we generally stand.
In recent days, it has become apparent that many people here still have a strong desire for the German federal election.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the German federal parliament is asked which wants to keep it alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found, to put it simply, a pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have expressed interest in rebuilding the project.
However, I also want to expressly call upon everyone again to participate, only in this way can this project also have a future success.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing arrangements need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten quite a bit, but that's not too bad, we have Discord at the end of the day.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let us decide democratically on the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still being delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/bulky and not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed it then when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned to me and I will receive a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Does the #PRS\_ORG# daily towel come in a larger size, such as 240/240, for example?
"PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective wardrobe will be picked up promptly."
And I kindly ask you to do so now.
"I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup - they need to clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how this will work."
PRS\_ORG can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pick-up date.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long do I have time to take care of this or decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I like.
She has also lived a vegetarian lifestyle for a while, and currently eats meat very rarely.
I myself was also a vegetarian for several years.
Upon being asked if I had always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I honestly answered without much thought.
And that is, I used to think that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but I eventually reflected and understood that I would ultimately support animal cruelty as well.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that annoyance arose on their side, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, she reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer was too simple?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without one intending to do so.
A vegan who loves harmony greets you.
This does not constitute an exception under §312d of the German Civil Code.
Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will be at the designated date when #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return in person.
As I cannot be present in person due to a funeral, unfortunately this cannot be changed either.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup time?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available consistently.
Lahnsteiner flood defense prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state.
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, presented a grant of 45,000 euros to the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte, for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us," says the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently dealing with rising insurance premiums: the boom in hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
Following their recommendations, however, I have synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, and it has worked.
I am a bit frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Alright, then that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS\_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking the time to address this matter. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e., we were both weapons carriers in the executive branch, but I don't want to go into that any further!
The question of right and left is always presented to me in a very oversimplified way.
Generally, one should say that the civil servant is rather from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, this should be clear to everyone.
Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people dressed in special uniforms and carrying weapons on the right of conservative magic should also be able to handle the lived reality. Of course, this is also clear, because in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with a migration background, women, and also homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the overly stereotypical cliché gays, because there are fewer or hardly any of these in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and on these people I can and must rely, because in doubt they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience, represent a conservative stance, they are proud of Germany and feel less comfortable with overly left-wing policies, even if these policies claim to speak for them or think they have to do what is right for them, they just want to be treated normally.
Returning to the rights, of course, police and military also represent a cross-section of society, where you will also find extreme rights, but they are allowed to openly express their opinions there or even openly devise dangerous plans for the state, which is completely exaggerated and annoying to me as well.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been on foreign deployment, begin to generalize and also say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain right-wing sympathizers meet up who engage in lively exchange of ideas.
Nonetheless, this is well combated in my opinion and also countered with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so very internationally entangled, and that's good in my opinion, that we can't afford to have actual racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I also ordered the other basket on the German side, I don't understand.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I ordered already in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It's still about my order that is no longer deliverable.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany, or is this basket available in Germany somewhere?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
"Ordinary by child?"
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a matter for some time now.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but I have always struggled to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases where everything stays put, and then occasionally it hits me and I clean up.
But it's actually never really "that someone could come to visit spontaneously".
My husband (unfortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household just loses against work and disgust.
The kitchen will be cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupying me for longer.
For me, I have no motivation to do it, it simply doesn't bother me as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen can be used.
Does having a child serve as a greater motivation or do you remain sloppy?
I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility.
Pre-shaping with specific, targeted molding at the joints for improved mobility (at the arms and knee joints).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to increase comfort even further.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbow and knee bends).
High-quality preparations in the lower back area and in the step provide for a close-fitting, perfect seat.
The Elaskin 8.8 stretch panel in the lower back area increases flexibility around the zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and adjusting equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing on the face of the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet).
The soft, collar-located zone improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop fastener that does not adhere to the coating or stitching.
Double-layered gloves with zippers on the arm and ankle joints connect an adjustable inner lining with a soft, padded neoprene outer lining.
45° pre-curvature at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load-bearing capacity when pulling on.
Long neck seam with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P Back-Pull Valve (Overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
"Reißverschlüsse an Armen und Beinen" translates to "Rip fasteners on arms and legs" in English.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the tear releases to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels neatly bonded with both external and internal overlapping.
"Edges of the outer ribs reinforced for greater load capacity"
Indented edges for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed an education in software development and have been out of college for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering for some time starting over and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPD).
In simpler terms, this means that I lack self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem speaking on a factual level with people, but it is very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe I have improved in this regard).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something to criticize about my code ("I've messed up again with the simplest things") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"He must really think I'm underqualified" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment.
What do they mean by "give back" please!
When I download a book from #PRS\_ORG#, the message appears that #PRS\_ORG# does not authorize this book.
Is there a problem?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own body proteins from these, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather development in nestlings and the feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disruptions in the breeding process.
After this inadequate dose of NEKTON-Bio, it should be resumed to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 gram NEKTON-Bio in 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A stirred measuring spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
For strong feather damages, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
According to this, the normal dose is administered until the feather formation is completely finished.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, away from sunlight, at a temperature between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but this chair is sold as an office chair.
How can a desk chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in conflict with the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled.
Also, a claim has been made against the community.
One employee writes to me that the pruning of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
In the bylaws, however, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use a new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, I still have a sofo without using it.
Could you offer me a discount or voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that's possible, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the cover shipped to Germany.
Can you check that?
Notification: Serious traffic accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord junction and Plößberg.
According to the current police press release (14:03), a car has come into the oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
"Ah okay, I understand."
Good, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Ideas and suggestions for further career development.
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought of.
Before I start digging here, briefly: I need advice, preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently doing the REF as a newcomer.
Initially, I studied something else and also worked in a field (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't want to mention anything specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that this was the right choice for me, even though the working conditions were much less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at my third "I Google other job postings".
And it's only been half a year so far.
Before painting, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the underpainting, after which I can still change direction.
"But I am absolutely finished."
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now there are vacations, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was my weekend and my weekend was my weekend.
There I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Generally, it's fun and from an external perspective, the REF also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I'm wondering how much stress my body can handle before it completely seals off - if it's not already doing so.
I ask myself if I want to continue the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work somewhat boring, I was appropriately paid for it and worked together as a team, not as a lone fighter like now, which is mostly the case most of the time.
But then I ask myself if I will not have returned to the same place in a year's time as I am now and be unhappy.
You notice, it's all somehow strange, but perhaps you as outsiders have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely done with and almost start crying at the slightest thought of it.
Making decisions right now, I am not emotional at all, which is likely to lead to nothing good.
But maybe your opinions will help me see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, resulting in, among other things, the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are introducing a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound technology.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and Amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers maintain an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is based partly on real analog circuits, because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances simply bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and manipulate historical facts on a virtual level, until the amp and effects sound exactly as you've always imagined.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance upgrade of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the VT20+ with built-in effects to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists searching for maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers.
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it won't be enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday with a score of 104:106.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Klett-closure fasteners, it adapts completely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories.
And those who have a small mirrorless camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and non-photo items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: possibly the longest in history
In the roughly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are not making any predictions as to when it may end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best message is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the last three months since the eruption began, the over 1,000-degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2,900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 120 hectares were covered by a layer of lava one meter thick.
This is equivalent to almost 1,700 soccer fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and damages are estimated at over 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new landings were created by cooled lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Heavily affected was above all the immensely important banana cultivation on the island, which provides about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants with their livelihood, either directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
25 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts
Christmas is coming and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly holiday.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something tempting about them.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold together our increasingly divided society.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-building social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated Christmas with gift-giving.
Previously, gifts were given in some way on St. Nicholas Day.
The background of this still popular custom today is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three women secretly gold into their window at night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving arose the popular German custom of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the role of mediators between God and humans as "saint veneration".
For these reasons, they are wary of the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
As most Protestants no longer see such details as such, it only irritates the fewest that the custom of St. Nicholas is similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession still being a firm part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, one can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree and by the door in shoes.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources prove a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who now brings gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who in principle is a kind of Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time.
This includes, for example, his white rush beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the Witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost brought some fame.
Here, it's not deer, but three horses pulling a sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the gift-giving.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near royal palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot and killed by police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had alerted them to a man who allegedly went into a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon.
According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was later stopped by officials.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was declared dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not believe it to be of a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also reside there.
"which one?"
No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your page.
The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden.
The lantern is simply set up and can be anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration of light: 10 hours.
The sturdy plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood movies, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from within.
Quite harmless is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The smooth, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
Its organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden.
He also does well in neighborhoods with larger gravel and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save big on preparation work: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Glowstone" on any sunlit spot during the day.
Two delivered earth augers ensure a firm grip when needed.
The matte white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module discreetly conceals "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk begins to fall, "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; you can choose the color yourself - there are six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to daylight white.
The shutdown also occurs automatically when the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew from the beginning the next day.
I have already done this several times, it doesn't work.

Pill problem
Hello dear female friends,  Ich hoffe, dass es euch gut geht und dass ihr alle in bester Gesundheit seid. Ich möchte euch heute mitteilen, dass ich mich in den Ruhestand verabschiedet habe. Es war eine schwere Entscheidung, aber ich glaube, dass es für mich die beste war. Ich werde meine Zeit damit verbringen, meine Hobbys zu genießen und mehr Zeit mit meiner Familie und Freunden zu verbringen.  Ich möchte mich bei allen bedanken, die mir in meiner Karriere geholfen haben. Es war eine großartige Erfahrung, mit euch zu arbeiten, und ich werde euch immer in meinem Herzen behalten.  Ich wünsche euch alles Gute für die Zukunft und freue mich auf neue Abenteuer und Erfahrungen.  Mit freundlichen Grüßen,  [Name]
I hope I'm doing this correctly, is this really my first post after a year on Reddit?
My problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pains and premenstrual syndrome before my period.
"Now I would like this to remain like this, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose."
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had suddenly gotten around 100 explosion-like pimples all over my body after a break of about two years.
So superficial, but it bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year break, it never really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this.
Unscented and without any fuss, my cosmetics are already like that, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
"The gynecologist didn't take me seriously, unfortunately, and the dermatologist appointment is still to come."
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
"Ah, the dear skin is such a thing."
Had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread keratosis pilaris and the acne theme.
I have also tried everything in terms of nutrition during my Christian illness and have ended up relying on a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that the worm is simply hormonal, but if you want to have construction sites everywhere like me, you might as well not want to look for anything else that might go wrong.
I had already done everything for her colleague, seminars and so on.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered about my concern.
I always have to work and answer the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
"but there is it generally in large"
"as it is available in large black letters"

In the name of the people: Laypeople give judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But their judgment depends on it, even if they don't wear a robe: judges determine with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes to jail.
Two of them report in conversation with the "public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately, I am unable to access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can the packaging material be disposed of?
We have no means to preserve this for so long.
We would use the table as offered as if it were ours.
Sure, had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and also received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now wanted to get one in gray.
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for collection and refund?
And when would be the pickup?
A 10 kV underground cable will be built new in 2022.
The permission for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision paves the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
"Bayernwerk, the network operator, has announced this now."
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially at our place so far.
The blue betsell number: #PRS\_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the process will continue now?
A beautiful start to the week!
"That, you can forget, I have already explained that several times yesterday!"
This is a glass commode and all the sides are bulged out, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged.
The commode is in my apartment and the #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
This means that the chest of drawers cannot be collected because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Lesson Plan (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching is fun for me, but I currently have major problems with time-efficiently planning my lessons in the subject of geography.
Unfortunately, my school is not at all technically equipped, so I basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
In school, I can also only copy black and white for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently just need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geo-factors, and for me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning by thinking about the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am not satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the work sheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# item from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the returns as quickly as possible first.
The trade fears the 2G rule for the Christmas business.
In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered may enter.
The trade considers this unnecessary and laments the decline in sales.
A possible solution has been prepared by him as well.
The 2G regulations, from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE), are damaging the important Christmas business for the retail sector.
Regarding business with articles of non-daily need, HDE-Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Genth criticized sales declines.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It is only available in the retail trade for daily necessities and in the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
"Shopping with masks, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO."
"2G when shopping does not bring us further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel effort.
The text in German is: "Die Bändchenregelung müsse bundesweit zugelassen werden, forderte er."  The English translation is: "He called for the nationwide approval of the band regulation."
According to this, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would receive a wristband that day, granting them access to all businesses.
In addition, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as is already the case in public local transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested).
Even the real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop, specializing in shopping centers, spoke of difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75% of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the turnover at around 90%.
"These numbers will now fall securely in the middle of such an important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, can present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel, can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it back up.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of it.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
One special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light that is completely flicker-free.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, which allows you to illuminate large areas with relatively small distances is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short intervals.
You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery) there.
User interface The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of the individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time and it will be set.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for operation with cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL312 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - it is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in both display indicators (the left battery in the upper display, the right battery in the lower display).
Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with current through the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
They have a 16mm threaded sleeve for securing, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably set using gauges on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy-duty use.
Additionally, a tilting hinge is included in the scope of delivery.
It is great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sorry, I got a gift that is too small :(.
"Party, which we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a comeback victory against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a row winless Hessians were supposedly on their way to the next Bundesliga debacle.
But then the SGE turned on, got rid of the frustration from a mixed start to the season within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise" to everyone involved.
At first, it looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, which was still lagging behind expectations in ninth place as before.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen 2-0 ahead.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance", so Glasner continued.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredible", said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a look at the result, especially for the viewers.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to keep the focus within himself, but he also feels well-prepared in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle.
"One did not want to 'move step by step and remain humble' and to carry out the tasks until the end of the year 'at this level'."
Next up is an away game on Wednesday as part of the English week, against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky).
I received the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
This would unfortunately mean that I will not order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball against Spain in the quarterfinals.
Germany's women's handball team slink off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after their humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the main round of the World Cup, the German national handball team suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and will now have to face hosts Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too afraid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We need to adopt a different approach towards Spain.
After the first tournament defeat, Germany finished Group III of the main round with 8 points as runners-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"It was a bad game for everyone, something we need to erase," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for qualification for the semi-finals, there must be a clear improvement against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup on the coming Tuesday, in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German thrower in a duel with the three-time Olympic champion from Denmark was Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted defender Xenia Smits and demanded: "We now need to quickly look forward."
Not up to par from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the level with the start.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only foreman Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with a few parades something worse.
The first goal was scored by the DHB-Team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this, however.
Against the aggressive pressing of the Danish women, the German women struggled to get into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team's goal.
The game was called off early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since defender Mia Zschocke saw a red card shortly after a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she can participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the German national team play a bit better and at least managed to score five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the substitution was gone after seven minutes at 9:19.
The Green protégés sinned again in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is among the medal contenders, at the final round.
After that, the German team was unable to catch up with their performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.
German: DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Familientraditionen in der Weihnachtszeit  English: DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season

How about your partner?
Would you like to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful for children?
"The shoe polish?"
Placekuchen?
Decorating with trees?
Is musically inclined?
Is it the Christmas man, the Christ child, or is the gift actually from Grandma and Grandpa?
No matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort and around Christmas, families go to great lengths to have it as beautiful as possible.
Whether they are now established traditions or something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!

such as with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers
What about them?
The title exists, I am working as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes.
As these will soon be largely completed, it will then go to some extent to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided that they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, does it interact with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility falls the information on vaccination, the indication for vaccination (person has a claim to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical auxiliaries.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have nurses there, but only (thank goodness no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot (may not?) perform vaccinations, so that I also administer most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidler" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidler"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, the Bavarian TV show "Wir in Bayern" has caused intense reflection.
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the "Host mi?" series remained unguessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And no one who must always be in a hurry.
As, heard the people from the TV presenter, is completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg announced as the solution and thus also caused astonishment among many people in the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidler", the audience learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven".
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatine term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
What closed an education gap - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# device, connected it to the computer, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures?
This morning, I woke up full of motivation to do something, because I wanted to prepare at least a little bit for my upcoming bicycle tour.
Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track.
Uh-oh, a hissing noise, and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the journey.
As I couldn't get a replacement coat and a replacement tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around again with a somewhat bad mood and take the first train back home.
The text in German is:  "War dann auch launentechnisch nicht ganz so schlimm, vielleicht ist es ja auch besser, wenn ich nochmal vor der Radtour das mit dem Reifenwechsel übe."  The translation to English is:  "Then it was not quite so bad technically, perhaps it is also better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour."
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would extremely dislike to frequently encounter this problem.
It wasn't really that bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had ridden 120km by the time I picked up the bike at 2pm) were also considered suboptimal, which he had mentioned because he had been riding on them for several more years.
But when I think about the fact that I have to make a tire change after driving for 80-90 km, I am really in a bad mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me in surprise why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be puncture-proof.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very tempting.
But are they really indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on the racing bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) wider tires in the Marathon Plus lineup, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
"Or would you recommend me to choose other tires for a racing bike generally?"
The Schwalbe website seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute! The experts seem to prefer the Durano DD more?
Thank you in advance for the help and kind regards!

Hello everyone,
Finally, we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: At least three people will be involved in the switch, so we will stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow along!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Get your drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
