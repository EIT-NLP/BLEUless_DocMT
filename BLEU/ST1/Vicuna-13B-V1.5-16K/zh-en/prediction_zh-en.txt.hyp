A meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate.
This is one of the important skill certificates besides the driver's license!
Please translate the following text from Chinese to English.  普及一下：急救措施其实是做发生突发事件时候的应急救援，即在救护车来之前的抢救。
As is well known, after an accident occurs, it takes some time for the ambulance to arrive. In fact, it is during this time that the situation is most critical.
At this point, it is a time that requires emergency treatment.
If I really have heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So it's really important to have people around you who know first aid!
When someone falls nearby, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly, doing nothing. The feeling of being helpless is too scary.
In China, our official data shows that there are three hundred thousand accidental deaths annually, with the most dangerous being cardiac arrest.
In the United States, the average survival rate is 15%.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founder of React, Pete Hunt, said.
If a person has a cardiac arrest and stops breathing, with no heartbeat, performing CPR on them is useless.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compression to have a chance to save the person.
I have found that we currently have very few people who are aware of the importance of learning first aid, but when an emergency arises, it is too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
It might save someone's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are also discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to complete before turning 25, adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certificate, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

Chongqing Municipal Vocational Colleges Pilot Modern Apprenticeship System: Students Entering School Are Considered as Enterprise Probationary Employees - Xinhua Net
Yesterday, a reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting from this year, the city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship" model for talent cultivation in 60 vocational schools. Students who are accepted for trial cultivation will have the status of apprentices, and after being enrolled, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The municipal education committee requires standardization of the recruitment and employment procedures for middle vocational schools and enterprises, clearly defining the dual identities of middle vocational school students as both students and potential employees, adhering to the principle of mutual choice, and signing tripartite agreements between students, schools, and enterprises. For students who have reached the age of 16 but have not yet reached the age of 18, agreements must be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific job position, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the student's on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship formats and collaborate with enterprises to jointly conduct pre-job training and re-skilling training for enterprise employees.
The pilot school plans to reform the mode of talent cultivation.
Schools and enterprises jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Pilot the internship program as a pilot period, and the internship time for students in enterprises is determined according to the vocational talent training plan, with the top-level internship generally lasting 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise squad-based management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form study groups, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 municipal intermediate vocational student pilot sites in three batches, with an approximate number of 50 people per site, and trained about 3,000 students (apprentices) in total.
According to the principle of pilot first and then roll out, gradually expanding from point to surface, explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise cooperative recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation, effectively improving students' on-the-job skills and increasing their employment rate and quality.

But the driver didn't go to the store to get the food.
South African doctor: Omicron's transmission power is strong, but most cases are mild.
Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the Omicron variant of COVID-19 causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Western Cape province reported that the symptoms experienced by the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The CEO, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pirelli said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, as these groups are more likely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19 infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta variant, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
"Many people will have to be hospitalized in a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic. The average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate among early cases in South Africa reached 20%.
The director of the Africa Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, quoted data from the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "Currently, we still need to obtain data from the later period."
Under normal circumstances, hospitalization and death occur later, but we entered this wave of the epidemic only two weeks ago.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still one of the major COVID-19 strains worldwide, Omicron cases are emerging in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Quebec increased by 400% in the first week of December, and testing showed that over 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

In fact, I don't know if it was a mistake by the store or the driver.
The Chinese text "袋子上没有单据" translates to "There is no receipt on the bag" in English.

Why not cancel it?
Hello, the restaurant sent live chicken soup.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a relatively affordable way to practice first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if it cannot be distinguished, then the normal price will be more friendly than the cheap one, this kind of "entry-level camera" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large, and even the professional players find it difficult to control.
The logic and subtext of these products are - tennis is so difficult, you can't learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so we'll fool you with cheap ones. You'll play twice and never play again. That way, this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad.
"When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have progressed. Then come back and buy from me again, and I'll make twice the money."
I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a second-hand good quality racket, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are well-known enough, so the good rackets won't sell for a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 is already quite good, and a second-hand one for 200 is a great deal. Wouldn't you enjoy the experience of having a thousand-dollar racket for just 200 bucks?
The text translates to:  Friendly to newbies, but once you pass the newbie stage, it's all downhill from there. But most people, especially women, can't get past the newbie stage.
The delivery time of the order has been repeatedly delayed.
Can you please follow up on this for me?
The Chinese character "推迟" (pronounced "tuìchí") means "delay" or "procrastination" in English. It can be used to describe the act of putting off or postponing something, often due to laziness, lack of motivation, or other reasons.
"谢谢" means "thank you" in English.
That is to say, I already have credit?
Next, do I need to place another order? Was the previous order no longer necessary?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but the food that was delivered was missing a lot of items, and the chicken was also alive.

Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural elementary school music teachers in the next three years - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 22 (Reporter Chen Yuxuan): Journalists recently learned from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education that in order to strengthen the shortage of teachers in certain subjects and ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, since 2016, the province has planned to train 10,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for primary schools in rural areas (townships and below) within three years.
According to the information, the target of this training is primary school teachers in Jiangxi Province who are under 45 years old and have a foundation or talent in music, art, and physical education. They can also serve as teachers of other subjects in these subjects.
Through training, enable them to master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of aesthetics, update their teaching ideas and concepts, grasp modern teaching methods, improve their ability to teach the subject, design activities, campus culture, and self-development, build a team of versatile aesthetics teachers, and alleviate the problem of shortage of aesthetics teachers in rural areas.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to train 100 primary school music, art, and physical education teachers in each of the province's 100 counties (cities, districts), with a total of 3,000 trainees. The training aims to comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leadership ability, curriculum design and organization ability, teaching ability, and network training workshop construction ability, and play a teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising role.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous wrong order.
But my wheel cake is gone.
Hello, when will the ordered meal be delivered?
The text in Chinese is "人家已收工" (rén jiā yǐ shōu gōng).  The English translation is "They have finished their work."
Your driver's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
Could you please provide a reasonable explanation?
Sure, but your driver has some issues. Please handle it well.
Can you check if it's still on the way? If possible, please send it to the destination.
OK, if it's really not available, then return the money for the reservation.
In fact, there is a lot of emphasis on clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight.
For a girl with a plump body, the length of the skirt she wears cannot be too short or too long. The ideal length should be around the knee, covering the plumpness of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the excess weight on your legs.
"过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉" can be translated to "When something is too long, it can give people a feeling of being short and fat."
If you separate the upper, middle, and lower sections with different colors, it will give the illusion that you are taller. Using different colors for the upper body, skirt, and long socks creates a sense of elongation.
In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the perfect match for chubby girls (a point the author has firsthand experience with). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body's chubbiness, and the elegant and noble black mini skirt is a top choice for chubby girls.
Wearing clothes in dark colors, especially black short skirts, can make people think you look slimmer.
If your calves are very fat, you should not wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular it becomes, the less vivid the colors should be.
So as not to draw attention to your legs and feet when people see you, giving off a feeling of being overweight.
For girls who are a bit chubby, it's important to teach them some tricks on how to dress and coordinate their outfits.
Don't wear tight short skirts, and avoid wearing tops that are too short or stuffed into your skirt, as it can be uncomfortable for others to look at. If you have thick legs, wear black opaque tights or grid tights (the kind with finer grids). Choose soft, printed A-line skirts and pair them with tops that have a ruffled collar. This can effectively cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, even the chubby girl is particular about her short skirt.
The plump girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the short skirt, which will make your plump figure appear taller.
Shorts paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the IN thing to do this summer!
If you are a bit heavier on top but have slim legs, I recommend choosing a glamorous short dress.
Not only can it cover your belly, but it can also showcase your advantages.
A-style shorts are very slimming, especially suitable for chubby girls. When choosing a top, it's best to choose something that fits tightly and creates a sense of layering, which will make you look even slimmer.
A simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even chubby MMs can try it.
The chubby girl can also exude fashion sense.

The red on my butt is a very nice color of wine, not as vulgar as imagined, and the overall quality is much higher than expected. It's a good buy and suitable for women too.

Is there only one xiaolongbao order?
Why are there 6 fingers?
I can't go.
I am a click-to-deliver driver.
In the past hour, no one has contacted me, which is basically online fraud.
Did you think I was calling for takeout for the first time?
After the investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order.
Sure, thank you! How many days?
From 7:00 to now 9:30, it hasn't been delivered yet. It's necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
The Chinese text "好的" translates to "Okay" or "Alright" in English.
Claimed to have the loudest exhaust note in the New Mountain District!
This time, our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The text translates to:  Priced at over two million yuan, with an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is?
I don't know either, according to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. It's probably because by the time myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h.
The low body, the aggressive scissor doors, the large air intakes on all sides of the body, and the flawless 6.5 V12 engine under the glass, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
You don't need to say too much about the car model. Just Google it and you'll find plenty of information. Here are some explanations that may not be provided by Google.
Too much attention received, going to where everyone is watching, feeling very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's a bit exciting)
1km的油钱在RM1左右（车主根本不在意）
Practice your posture for getting on and off the bus, otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing (because you might not be able to get out of the bus and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, and it causes sudden tinnitus after getting off the car (but it's still very cool).
The car body is too big, it will be quite narrow if parked in a regular parking space, and I'm afraid it will be hit by the car next to me when they open their door!
Feeling a bit lonely because there's no opponent on the road (I'm talking about myself, not the car, haha).
Please don't misunderstand, the video is not for sale. Sorry!
If you have friends who want to shoot videos for their beloved cars, please feel free to contact us!
More car information that you don't know is in The Car Guide / People's Car Encyclopedia.
The accident involves a value of millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, while the Porsche 911 is also in the six-figure price range!
On that day, hundreds of thousands of supercars, including the 911 and the Chiron worth millions, were wiped out in just a few minutes in a foreign country.
The result proves that it makes sense!

Guangxi college students can suspend their studies for up to 5 years to engage in entrepreneurship - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19th (Reporter Zhang Ying) - According to a recent report from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system in the future, and the academic leave for undergraduates will be extended. The academic leave for students who start their own businesses during their studies can be extended for 2 to 5 years based on the original academic system, and the time of academic leave for entrepreneurship can be regarded as practical education time.
To promote the improvement of college students' entrepreneurial innovation ability, the Guangxi Education, Human Resources and other departments jointly established an entrepreneurial platform, building more off-campus practical teaching bases for college students, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurial incubation bases, providing external guarantees for college students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the innovation and entrepreneurship practice base for colleges and universities should have an area of more than 30,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and more than 20,000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship majors and gives priority support to students who perform excellently in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to transfer to the major.
College teachers must go to industry enterprises for at least two months every two years to undergo on-the-job training, in order to enhance their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Department of Education requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the innovation and entrepreneurship training program for college students. The goal is to ensure that every college student participates in a innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their time in school.
Colleges and universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at different levels, and provide financial support.

After seeing my wedding dress photo, I realized that I was also a "victim of deception."
Asian American groups file lawsuit against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools over discrimination in college admissions - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian-American organizations in the United States filed a lawsuit against the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, protesting against the discrimination against Asian-American applicants by the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - in the admission process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington the same day.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of top American universities has increased many times over, but the proportion of Asians in these 3 top American universities has remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and persistently discriminated against Asian American applicants in the so-called "holistic" admissions process.
Zhao Yukun introduced and said that the research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among the three universities, the acceptance rate of Asian applicants was the lowest compared to the number of applicants of all ethnicities.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit an appeal, and then the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice can launch an investigation and take measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian students in the admission process after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained universities can actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons.
In addition to the Chinese American organizations participating in the appeal, it also includes Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational organizations in the United States.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yuejia Town, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing the factory with the owner's relative, Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank as a deposit on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the recipient of the deposit on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Agreement," which stipulates, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week."
However, after that, both parties failed to reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the scope of the factory's sale and the payment method, resulting in the housing purchase contract being delayed and not signed.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu.
The house that was difficult to find, the deposit has been paid, and the mortgage is also ready. All that's left is to sign the contract, but the seller suddenly refuses to sell, leaving Mr. Lu at a loss and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yuyang Municipal People's Court.
According to the court's review, since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it cannot solely be attributed to the defendant. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double compensation for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
Lawyer's Reminder: Exercise necessary caution in the transaction process.
When signing the contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due diligence, such as verifying the information of the owner of the property and whether the property is occupied by someone, and clearly specifying the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
Okay, I'm afraid he might send the wrong address.

The Malatang is too fragrant, too soft, and too delicious. 😋 If you like desserts, you must try "East River Old Fish Slippery Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh and the tofu is very tender. The ink...
Taste praise, good meat, enthusiastic service.
It has been a long time since I last came to Daychang, and the fruit tea is still so delicious and made with real ingredients. The first time I tried the sticky rice balls, I fell in love with the soft and southern taste of the glutinous rice flour!
The clay pot rice was just right in terms of moisture, and the portion was very generous. The signature silicon paper-wrapped chicken wings were as delicious as ever, and the soup was not bad either. The broccoli was also well-prepared.
Taste praise, service enthusiasm, meat good.

I haven't been to Daychang for several years, and the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow.

Taste praise, meat good, staple food praise.

The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the saltiness is not strong enough, so the sweetness is highlighted instead. You can all imagine adding sweetness and various spices to the dish...
What is the method of drinking red label whiskey?
Everyone has different hobbies, some people like to collect things, some people like to enjoy delicious food, and of course, some people like to appreciate whiskey. Red Label Whiskey is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at an international spirits competition.
Every bottle of Johnnie Walker whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, wouldn't you be wasting its aroma and alcohol content?
How do you drink red label whiskey?
Here's the English translation:  The little editor will briefly introduce it to everyone.
Red Card Whiskey Drinking Method:  1. Pour a shot of Red Card Whiskey into a glass. 2. Add a few ice cubes to the glass. 3. Slowly sip the whiskey, savoring the flavor and aroma. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the glass is empty. 5. Enjoy the warmth and relaxation that comes with drinking Red Card Whiskey.
Johnnie Walker Blue Label Scotch Whisky is made from 35 different Scotch whiskies, with a rich and intense aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The rich and intense aroma has a hint of sweetness and smokiness.
The taste is rich and refreshing, with a hint of lavender and a strong smoky flavor of smoked barley.
This liquor can be directly added with ice and consumed, or it can be mixed with your favorite drink to be consumed.
Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky has entered the Chinese market, and to cater to the tastes of the Chinese people, Johnnie Walker Red Label + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other fizzy drinks have become an enduring fashion trend.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize sourness, can visually bring pleasure to people and have the effect of changing the taste of the drink by diluting the alcohol flavor.
Red card whiskey + sliced lemons + granulated sugar (brown sugar is also acceptable) is the most authentic and traditional way to enjoy it.
The authentic red method has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the acidity, and lemon can bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine, of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal preference.
The following three ways are the best ways to enjoy Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky. Everyone can use them as a reference and try them out. I hope my introduction can help everyone.

Madame Qin's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) does not have branches yet.
Before taking photos, we didn't arrange the time well, and we changed the time twice. Consultant Lanlan was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a weekend with good weather to shoot.
The staff at Madame Jin's workplace, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised.
That was my first formal makeup, wow~ I can't believe it, I will also become that beautiful one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I forget her name) have super patience in makeup and the makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiangwan City, fortunately the weather was very good and we didn't feel too cold during the photo shoot. The makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothing, accessories, and would immediately help us fix anything that wasn't quite right.
The photographer is also very humorous and feels happy every day when taking photos.
When choosing photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the client delete too many photos. But when we were choosing photos, there was absolutely no intention of us asking them to add photos. We just took the 24 photos that came with the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister, who took her wedding photos at the same time, had a package of over 7,000 yuan and added more than 1,000 photos. At that time, I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many).
The photos have been fixed today, and Lanlan sent them to me. After looking at two of them, I didn't think they were very good, and they immediately helped me redo them.
Take out the photos that my younger sister took before, and compare them to ours. I think we are really satisfied with our photos, they are simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that everyone go to Xuanhan Gold Lady for their wedding photography!
Set price: 3999 RMB.
Madame Jin, thank you for your sincere gratitude and kind wishes. May your future be as bright as brocade!

320 newborn babies in Sabah did not receive birth certificates due to counterfeit paper.
(KUALA LUMPUR, October 11) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the special anti-forgery paper stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the agency, Kirua Aminu, assured that the information of all infants who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeiting paper will be supplemented next week when it arrives.
At a press conference, he explained in response to a report by an online media outlet that there had been issues with the printing of the Sabah newspaper for up to 10 months.
He said the problem emerged two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same issue.
One of the reasons is that the Chinese manufacturer producing custom anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in arrival in our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeiting paper used by the Sabah newspaper and other regions are different, so it cannot be borrowed from the inventory of other states.
According to Keru Aminu, the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to a printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to place an order on Wednesday next week. After returning to Sabah, the final stage of printing will be carried out immediately, and it is estimated that it will be handed over to the applicant within two working days (December 20th)."
"We will notify the applicants to go to various local branches to collect their admission papers."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 admission papers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock in the morning until now.
Is it almost time now?
I mean food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS\_ORG#.
Okay, thank you. The restaurant says they are ready.
Thank you, I will place the order again with points.

48-hour nucleic acid negativity, the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism requires strengthening epidemic control at ports and coastal cities - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11th (Reporters: Dong Ruifang, Gu Tiancheng) The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic in port cities, requiring people who have recently left land ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macao) to present a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and requiring people traveling to land ports of entry to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city scope and announcing it in each province, district, and city to March 15th, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that conditionally open ports can study setting epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a major economic support and the exchanges between the two sides are frequent.
Implementing differential management policies, a single control and prevention line against spillover will become two lines, which is expected to achieve an advance in the border control, compress the spillover risk of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and cost.
In recent times, there have been several local clustered outbreaks in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry in cities.
The aforementioned notice pointed out that there are some issues such as insufficient real-time monitoring and early warning of local epidemic situations, non-implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in all links, improper management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control system at the border port city, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to strengthen the weak links in the port city's epidemic prevention and control work, and to do the work scientifically and accurately, without any slackness, and to tighten the external prevention and control line.
Notice emphasizes that all ports and cities should synchronize the research and deployment of epidemic prevention and civilian life protection, publicize and open up civilian life protection hotlines, regularly investigate and identify potential risks in basic life supplies and prices, and promptly solve and actively respond to prominent issues reflected by the public.
According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include those with open land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), municipalities (prefectures, cities, autonomous regions), and directly administered municipalities, with the specific scope to be determined and announced by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on epidemic prevention and control needs.

Oil pipeline video reveals 20-year US military obsession with bloodshed and slaughter - Xinhua News Agency

On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the oil pan platform caused widespread attention.
This film tells the story of how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "fighting terrorism" and forcibly exported American-style democracy, resulting in 20 years of poverty, violence, and the killing of innocent people, committing numerous crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to launch attacks on hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, distorting human nature, and forming a killing group.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" where "suspects" are subjected to various forms of torture and physical humiliation.
One atrocity after another, the Taliban's crimes against humanity have provoked even more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video said, the US "anti-terrorism" war "becomes more and more terrifying."
The war did not bring the Afghan people peace, democracy, and prosperity, but only left the country full of wounds and countless killings and destructions.
Watch the video with me and let's uncover the truth behind America's so-called "anti-terrorism" actions that involve bloodshed and slaughter. Let's expose the hypocrisy and false facade of American-style democracy!

Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When browsing bookstores, one can often sense the popularity of successful self-help books.
Many successful self-help books today promote the "best principle" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do.
Let me translate the text from Chinese to English:  Which means that we need to talk about the most important and fundamental aspect, which is "how to achieve it."
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done to the best, or they are not done at all; either they are 100, or they are 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just stay where you are.
This "best principle" allows everyone who sees it to recognize its "correctness beyond doubt," but 99% of people will be intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a firm decision, transform yourself 180 degrees," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people.
For those who stubbornly adhere to the old ways, refuse to change, and cling to outdated traditions, you should shout loudly in their ears, "You must transform!" Without a doubt, this is self-deception and beating a dead horse.
Most people will feel timid and hesitant before the word "transformation," taking small steps and finding it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, they may impulsively make a decision to undergo "transformation" and boldly take the first step, but this is often short-lived, and they quickly lose momentum and fail to see it through to the end, lacking sustainability.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue "Starting from Tomorrow" perfectly embodies the classic representation of "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "despair and sigh."
Perhaps, "the next best principle" is a way that may lead more ordinary people to a relatively successful path.
The core principle of "次好原则" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100, doing 1 is fine: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is fine too, because that's still better than walking on the ground.
In general, doing something is always better than doing nothing at all.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it is now possible for ordinary people to persevere, and by persevering, the chances of success will also increase.
Although following the "Pareto Principle" can lead to success, the journey may be slightly longer.
In summary, the "best principle" may wave the banner of making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can effectively motivate only a few people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
"电话无人接听" translates to "Phone unattended" in English.
The Chinese text "不停延误" translates to "no stop delay" in English.
Not delivered yet.
Excuse me, when will it be delivered?
How can I contact you?
Please cancel the order.

Qinghai Lake naked carp resource reserves increased by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang): According to the latest monitoring results, the bare carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,000 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 million tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative increase has exceeded 40 times. The news was learned from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Department.
Qinghaihu naked carp, also known as "Wei Fish", is a valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake, playing a crucial role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain safety and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human activities such as large-scale killing and degradation of the breeding environment, the number of Tibetan antelopes in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. By 2002, the stored resources of Tibetan antelopes in Qinghai Lake had dropped to 2,592 tons.
In 2003, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species."
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on catching and selling naked carp in the lake and its main rivers and tributaries. No unit, collective, or individual is allowed to catch or sell naked carp or its products in Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas.
At the same time, through artificial reproduction and cleaning up the main river channels leading into Qinghai Lake, as well as designing scientific and reasonable "fish passageways," the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has been increasing annually.
The vice director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of 1.8 billion fry of naked carp have been artificially bred and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing to a recovery rate of over 23% of the naked carp resources in the lake.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water source nurturing region not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of western desertification to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, and to protect the aquatic wildlife, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "One River, One River, One Lake".

Taking a foot bath and getting an electric shock in the foot at the same time, is it a leakage of electricity?
Choosing an appropriate foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic and health-preserving effect on the feet. Today, the editor of Jia Mei Xiao will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, providing consumers with a wide range of choices, from foot bath basins priced at over 100 yuan to thousands of yuan.
In the relevant data surface, compared with traditional home appliances, sales of health-related home appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but the foot bath basin does not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety hidden danger.
"Swimming in an electrified river with your feet? That's too dangerous, isn't it!"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently he bought a foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with a ballpoint pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that there was electricity in the water of the footbath.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, even though he lost the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he discovered that this popular foot bath basin has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of applicable population, materials ensuring safety at the highest temperature setting.
However, in general, foot bath basins will not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during production.
Therefore, when purchasing, choose a modular bathtub.
Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard.
"At the same time, you can casually use a pen to test."
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Top News - Hunan Daily Online - Hua Xiang Online
On December 10th, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and New Tea Product Launch Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center this morning. The event showcased the tea industry, innovated tea technology, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the pursuit of the tea industry's goal of reaching a trillion-dollar market.
The Vice Chairman of the All-China Wholesale and Retail Association, Huang Shunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: "Huogong Red" comes from new technology, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into "Five-Color Tea" in Hunan.
In recent years, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the "10 Billion Yuan Changsha Tea Industry" and forming a development pattern of "Three Changsha, Four Waters, Five-Color Teas".
The tea industry in the province is stepping up innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to launch new products. The main tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving income for a large number of tea farmers.
The wind of fortune is constantly changing, and red tea is making a comeback.
Tea experts in the province claim that by picking both green tea and red tea, tea farmers can have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens will continue to rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Lake Red Tea" trademark and welcomed them to the "Lake Red Source".
In the New Tea Culture Exhibition Hall, a tea merchant from Fujian saw a tea named "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with excitement, "Currently, the epidemic and other factors have had an impact on the tea market, but from the tea expo, we can see that there are many highlights."
A touch of Xincha red tea, infused with the essence of tea culture, has gained popularity and sparked a surge in transactions. The Changsha tea industry is welcoming a new spring.

Thank you for the rabbit's comment. Originally, I was going to say that rejecting ancient style was not suitable for ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can give us the energy to keep moving forward, and we will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend it to all of you!
No matter whether it's reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, or photography, everything is flawless.
The makeup artist is particularly skilled and will match your makeup style with high-end brands to create a look that suits you.
Teacher Tian Rong, it's quite professional in photography.
The entire studio has a strong artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and the popular movie theaters in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance. My colleagues have taken pictures there, and after watching the finished product, they thought it was just so-so.
Seeking out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is quite poor, and we feel that this is also the case for most people. Photographer Brother Liang will capture and record the natural and splendid moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a top-notch team.
When it comes out, we and the people around us will praise it to no end.
She has recommended her best friend, and her best friend has just seen the raw footage and is equally delighted.
I hope this kind of studio won't be buried and more people can discover TA, create their own style instead of being uniform.
Thank you Jinxing and Qingling for your five-star reviews. Both of you are very creative and innovative young people, and we are a creative studio. As long as our clients like us, we will put in 200% effort to complete the project. We are grateful to have met each other.
A sweet and caring assistant, as well as a lively and cheerful photography teacher, made every member of the team feel super nice and had a wonderful shooting experience that was hard to forget. The results of the shooting were even better than I had imagined. Thank you all for your hard work! 😘😘
Thank you for your comment, Little Universe. Meeting you is also a kind of fate. From Urumqi to Qinhuangdao, our trust is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to meet you. I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao to play again.

Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programming novice who wants to share their personal experience.
If you plan to enter this industry, you can consider finding a place to receive training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very expensive, and it takes 6 months to learn.
However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is even better for them.
If you have a strong self-study ability, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
Firstly, we need to look at the institution's faculty strength. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, then the training institution would be meaningless. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have particularly strong faculties.
Secondly, before making a decision, it's best to investigate this training institution. It would be ideal to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution, as only the students know how this institution really is, whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question either, because you haven't introduced your own situation, and studying this thing is closely related to your personal circumstances.
For example, factors such as profession, age, and the language you want to learn, as well as the city in which you want to study or work, will all be related to the industry you are interested in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated or if you are a computer major who has already graduated, if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are many training institutions both offline and online that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is quite substantial. You generally need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
However, if it's about the situations I mentioned, self-study would be very convenient. Now there are many free learning resources on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili for more training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultations.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining them with videos.
If you're not a computer professional but can afford a certain amount of study fees and time costs, it's recommended to attend a training institution for learning. This way, you don't have to exert too much effort in learning, and the teachers will explain in detail. If you have any questions, there will be people dedicated to answering them. Additionally, it's helpful in terms of study planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend students to companies after studying, so you can save a lot of trouble in the later job interview stage.
The above are my views. As mentioned earlier, due to not understanding your situation, I only gave a general introduction and did not go into detail. If you have any other questions you would like to consult on, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion at any time.
I arrived at 1 point before. I saw it in the app.
"What is called" or "What is referred to as".
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I, undertake various (installation, cleaning, repair) services for wall-hung boilers, water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stovetops, oil fumes, lighting fixtures, and glass polishing. I am a professional seamstress and offer household services.
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is tiring, but we have to keep going for the sake of living.
Life won't disappoint those who strive for it. If you like it, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only see the results, you have to bear the process alone, facing life, we are not only strong, but also have to continue, there is no other choice, the road can be turned back and looked at, but cannot be turned back and walked on...
Cleanliness is a job, a responsibility, and life becomes beautiful because of service, and service becomes exquisite because of heart.
Although cleaning may be the dirtiest job we do, we approach it with the utmost seriousness, meticulously cleaning every corner of our customers' homes until they are spotless. Seeing the satisfied smile and the raised thumb from our customers, at that moment, all the hard work is worth it, and the effort pays off!
My daily work.
Your request, my service.
"Heartfelt service, heartfelt cleaning, preserve the beauty."
"The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services will do our best to make it 'clean' for you, serving with love."
"Bǎo wàn jiā jìng, shù jiā zhèng dì bēi, wèi wù dào wèi, jìng jìng dào jiā."
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, this is my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is magnificent, if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly, just like life.
"Success comes from doing things with care, and refinement comes from paying attention to the details. We are meticulous in our work."
"Give me a chance, I guarantee you'll be satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, and your endorsement is my greatest motivation!"
The current situation in all industries is tough!
But I always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, perseverance, and hard work, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who just sit and complain.
The key to a successful day lies in the morning, all beauty begins with the dawn. I hope you bring happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction as you start a new day. Maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed; as we grew up, happiness became a goal to strive for; and as we matured, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and once we understood this, we were happy.
Be the truest, kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and have no regrets in this life. Life is a single path, walk your own path. Life has two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, live happily and beautifully until old age!
In every stage of life, one will encounter different difficulties.
Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but your courage to face things positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it's better to face it head-on.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; but if you face challenges head-on, you will eventually overcome them.
Translation:  Curators from China and Saudi Arabia collaborate to hold the first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, December 12 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Jun) The first Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the JAX Art District in Diriyah, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China are participating in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition is co-curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with UCCA Center for Contemporary Art director Liu Ding serving as artistic director.
According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this biennale is "Touching the Stone to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, as well as reflecting the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This year's biannual exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with six interconnected buildings forming six units to present: "Touching Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists have also attracted attention, with some artists using innovative ways to create with recycled materials, such as Xu Ice in the "Behind the Story Series: Qi Shan Wu Xian Tu" (2014), who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
The chief executive officer of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakri, stated that he hopes this year's biennale can establish an international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community, enhancing interaction and communication.
Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biannual exhibition is double: on the one hand, it allows contemporary art from Saudi Arabia to participate in the global dialogue, and on the other hand, it allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to the information, a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, in which artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Unify and Standardize the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Rural Areas - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12th (Reporter Lin Bi Feng): In order to continue to provide employment assistance to poverty-stricken populations and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation and development, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas and assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the employment of poverty-stricken laborers and other disadvantaged rural groups, which play an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment income, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects.
This regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Human Resources and Social Security Department, the National Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and four other departments. It mainly standardizes the scope of subjects for recruiting rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, position development, and position management.
In terms of on-the-job development arrangements, the new regulations clearly stipulate that they should be based on the principles of "needs-based positioning, on-the-job determination, dynamic management, and overall quantity control" as well as the principles of "one person, one post, voluntary publicity, and unified management."
The recruitment process must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, public announcement, employment, pre-job training, and arrangement for on-the-job.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the relevant departments to supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions. The regulations also stipulate that the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for the personnel in rural public welfare positions.

Hello
May I cancel the order?
I will place an order again.
Has it been canceled?
Although the rightists had a period of triumph in history, it was not long-lasting. They shone brightly when they received a little bit of sunshine, but started to sweat when they drank a little bit of water. As soon as they achieved their goals, they would become arrogant and attach themselves to others.
But to speak the truth, the rightists played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From defining the truth standard at the end of the Cultural Revolution to promoting economic development, technological advancement, and political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
Three, as far as I'm concerned, although I don't fully agree with some of Li Yuedong's statements, I'm very interested in what he has to say, and I also respect him as a person. This is because he is serious, he takes China seriously, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that resistance is necessary, but revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, chaos in political organizations, and then foreign powers will take advantage of the situation.
Four, to change or improve China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who engage in political speculation and try to pick the easy way out are not rightists, they are just a bunch of idiots.
Let's talk about that again.
On the left, they are actually a group of orphans of the times and politics.
If we say that the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their ideas when necessary. However, the left does not have this tendency because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away!
Recently, I've seen some friends complaining about the bad guys while also criticizing the leftists, and they're still full of energy. I think it's not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists, it's a lost cause. They're both stubborn and there's no reasoning with them.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making the counter-thieves and the leftists acknowledge it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the counter-revolutionaries curse you for five mace, and when the left-wingers curse you as a right dog, it just proves that our middle way is the right way!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but when they grow old, they forget their ideals or pursue them but end up becoming obsessive.
The ideal is getting further and further away, and even the young dragon slayer has become an evil dragon in the end.
I think left and right generally refer to constraints and freedom, and from China's historical and cultural genetics, China as a whole should lean towards the left.
The domestic right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and places greater emphasis on fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and the competition between China and the United States is inevitable. It is certain that the left-leaning trend will continue for many years to come.
Although I don't understand, a like is enough.
I won't say anything more, but the flowers are so loyal.
The Chinese text "不等了" translates to "Not yet" in English.
At 19:06, it's been 2 hours since I placed the order 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches".
What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: February 2nd dragon lifts its head, Klar raises prices, and the event of goods being transported by trucks. Public opinion spreads and forms a wave peak, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and finally dissipates. If there is a secondary public opinion, there will be a small "camel peak" reappearing.
They look exactly the same as the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is the public opinion on exceptionalism?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event shows a "peak shape", a "sawtooth shape", and a "cliff shape".
[Peak shape] refers to human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; [Sawtooth shape] refers to cyclical heating, ensuring the topic remains on the hot search rankings; [Cliff shape] refers to collective withdrawal, with the hot search fulfilling its "function" and moving on to a new task, heading to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event coincides with the trough of another event, with a time difference of only seconds. This must be the unified dispatch of the water army receiving the task and launching a new round of offensive.
The professionalization of black PR is evident in its diversity: dozens of trending topics appear on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones lead the trend, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones stimulate emotions, and which ones manipulate decision-making. Black PR accounts are divided into batches and targeted at different nodes, almost considering all elements of the spread of public opinion.
Propagation is a science, casting aside subjective factors such as stance and emotions, PR will also disappear without a trace when based solely on objective data.
Wherever you go, you will leave a trace. Let's dig up these traces together.

Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of COVID-19 - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th. According to Xinhua News Agency correspondents abroad, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of infection with the new coronavirus variant Omicron.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on December 10.
According to the Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected individual is a local resident who came into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius, and tested positive on November 30th through a nucleic acid test.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, both infected individuals tested negative for the nucleic acid, and they have now returned to their respective residences.
The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of Omicron variant infections.
These 3 people are all students and returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. Since they all had mild symptoms, they did not receive hospital treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the government of Seoul is constantly increasing its prevention and control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 or above who take a flight to enter the country will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense upon arrival at the airport.
On January 10th, the Saudi Ministry of Health announced that it will begin vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Khumbize Kumwembe said on the 9th that the country has detected its first three cases of Omicron COVID-19 variant infections.
The health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 19th to December 2nd and found these 3 infection cases.

The Chinese text "收到是金钱肚" translates to "Received, it's a belly full of money" in English.
The order is phoenix claw.
Sure, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.
Do you want me to stay in the conversation?
I explained to your staff on the phone.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
Dà Měi 360 Jí Chéng Jiā Zhuāng  Translation: "Da Mei 360 Home Furnishings"
Address: No.156, Huan Cheng Nan Lu, Happy Home, 12th Floor.
At the beginning, it was introduced by friends because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic decoration.
As soon as they arrived at the store, a series of tricks began.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote saying my 135 square meter house can be done for 70,000, and roughly looked at their materials without knowing what brand they were.
Their second trick is that as soon as you arrive at the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (and once you pay, you will never be able to get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
When I was hesitating to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount.
This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid a deposit of over ten thousand yuan.
He gave me a quote with many problems, 70,000 yuan does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, and these three are the basic costs.
Excluding their service fees, which are higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and made me sign the contract.
When I went to ask for a refund, they showed a very experienced appearance, with a dedicated team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it ends up, it will be the customer's problem they have no responsibility for.
There are various ways to shift responsibility, and there are many details involved. I don't want to go into all of them, it's too emotional. Basically, don't choose them, because my friend found that the quality of the houses they decorated was not good, and they will charge you various fees in the end.
Crater, they were originally the decorative dragon head of the swindler, now they have become beautiful, as if they have gone bankrupt and transformed into something else.
So don't choose such unreliable decoration companies.
In the future, everyone should check these consultations thoroughly when choosing, because renovation is not cheap.
To ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of merchant reviews, please see the merchant declaration for details.
"Dazhong Dianping Kunming Furniture Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours, for beautiful 360 integrated home decoration. Find decoration companies on Dazhong Dianping."
So terrifying, if it takes less than 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my refund within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it could be canceled within 15 minutes.
"Kǒu shuǐ jī yīng xū de, dàn shōu huò de shēng ròu, méi bāng fāng chī"  This should be translated as: "The mouth-watering chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it."
I haven't received a response for 3 days now. Due to your system's inability to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly subscription plan!
The strangest thing is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
I have to pay for shipping every time.
Can you first grant an exemption, and then collect my monthly fee after your investigation is complete? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's almost 3 o'clock.
Is it for me to provide compensation?
I said to deliver goods and knock on the door.
But the driver was left outside the door, and then the person left.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is incomplete and doesn't make sense in Chinese. Could you please provide me with the full text or context so I can better understand what you're trying to communicate?
Your driver has already picked up an order for me, but is still telling me to wait.
The driver received my delivery at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
After I finish buying, do I need to order anything else?
The Chinese text "怎么办" translates to "What to do" in English.
Where has your driver gone?
Are you waiting for something?
I am sending a package.
Alright, if you don't cancel, I'll report you.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

The translation for "补回优惠代码就可以了" in English is:  "You can use the promo code now."
No problem, don't need to arrange resend, I have bought it elsewhere, don't want to waste.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such behavior of personal attacks.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of thug.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing we need to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending friend requests on QQ and posting provocative posts, to your attempt to publish what you call my hometown and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After you left, you became more diligent and continued to tag me with a frequency of more than one meal a day, but you also continued to discuss some ambiguous, derogatory comments about me on Facebook with your so-called friends, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and what kind of fruit to plant in bed, etc. I... I've had enough.
How do I know later that I received more friend requests from friends on Facebook who uploaded a photo of me with sexual harassment comments?
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After the news of my reporting was uploaded, you didn't show any restraint at all, but instead became more and more arrogant.
I don't care what your political background is, or what your identity and status are. In our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment. You can even deny that it's not your own photo or continue to post all the attacking comments.
Correct, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your comments.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate her like this for the sake of fame.
A friend asked me, "How are you doing?"
I said it would happen, but you wouldn't believe me.
I think it's unlikely that any girl would feel okay after being bullied to such an extent.
Regardless of whether it is in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even the most basic moral character would choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that righteousness resides in the hearts of people.
I captured some comments for everyone to review.
The post you posted should not be able to be impersonated by anyone, right?
I can only say you are the enemy of culture.
"会心一笑" can be translated to "a smile from the heart" or "a heartfelt smile" in English.
I have reported and attached a photo, but have not received a response.
"What cow, no cow"
It's braised chicken, with live meat.
"没办法吃" can be translated to "No way to eat" in English.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?
The word "unacceptable" can be translated to Chinese as "不可接受的" (bù kě jiē shōu de).
The order has already been placed.
"说是 7 点多送到" translates to "Said to be delivered at 7 plus points" in English.
Why do we need to remake it?
"太离谱了" can be translated to "Too out of tune" in English.

On December 10, 2021, the "Intelligence Converges on Dongting Lake" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit was held in Changsha. (Reported by all media journalist Chou Pingxun on December 9th)
A member of the Provincial Committee and the head of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, Wang, attended the launching ceremony and gave a speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that holding a talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central Talent Work Conference and the 12th Provincial Party Congress, and fully demonstrates the importance that Hunan attaches to talent, its eagerness for talent, and its sincere use of talent.
Hunan, with its excellent tradition of respecting and loving talents, broad platform for talent development, and environment conditions for a better life, has in recent years implemented a talent-led development strategy, with the "Furong Talent Action Plan" as its guide, building a talent cultivation, retention, and utilization system across the entire chain, becoming a fertile land for talent growth and achievement, a hot land for innovation and entrepreneurship, and a pleasant land for living and working.
Currently, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "three highs and four news" strategic positioning and mission tasks. It will further open the door to attract and retain talents, provide more favorable policies for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions. We hope that outstanding talents from all walks of life will join forces with Hunan to promote high-quality development and gather intellectual resources.
The activity set up exhibition halls in Changsha, Zhuhai, Yueyang, and Hunan Free Trade Experimental Zone. The Provincial Science and Technology Department, the Provincial Department of Industry and Information Technology, and the Provincial Department of Human Resources and Social Security released the advanced manufacturing industry technology innovation key demand list, the intelligent manufacturing industry talent demand catalog, and the post-doctoral flow station intelligent manufacturing industry youth talent demand catalog.
48 large enterprises in China, including China CNR, China United Heavy Machinery, and Yueda Technology, have conducted on-site recruitment of over 1,000 recent graduates and professionals in related fields through talent projects.

The Yangtze River's mainstream has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11th (Reporter Wang Hui) The Chongqing Shuicheng Water Sports Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on the 10th, which is the second water sports green integrated service area in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to officially operate after the Sichuan Luzhou Water Sports Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on the 8th.
With this, the water surface green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The vice director of the Changjiang Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transport introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had built and put into operation 10 waterway green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been widely recognized by sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water surface is another milestone event in the green navigation construction of the Yangtze River, which significantly improves the reception of ship-borne pollutants and the navigation service capability.
According to introduction, the water-surface green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for the vast number of ships and crew, and to help solve the "urgent worries" of seafarers.
The two water-based green comprehensive service areas established this time on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life services, production services, and government services as one, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the highlight. They will achieve the "one-stop docking, multiple services" for ships in the port area, making it more efficient and convenient for sailors who have been navigating the Yangtze River for many years.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
