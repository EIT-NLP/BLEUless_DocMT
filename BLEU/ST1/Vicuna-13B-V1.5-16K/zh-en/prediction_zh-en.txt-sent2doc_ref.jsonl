the average stay at hospital is reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days; only 3% of the latest patients of COVID-19 died, which used to be as high as 20% in the cases of the early epidemic phase in South Africa.By quoting the data from National Institute of Infectious Diseases of South Africa and other reports, Willem Hanekom, Director of Africa Institute of Health said, “At present, almost all the evidence indicates that this is a relatively mild disease.”He also said: “However, it’s still at early stage, and we need to obtain data of later stage.In general situations, hospitalization and death happen later, and it’s only two weeks since we entered into this round of epidemic.”At the same time, scientists from all over the whole world are observing the number of medical cases and the rate of hospitalization, as well as testing the effect of the current vaccines and treatment method.Although Delta is still the main COVID-19 virus strain of the world, Omicron cases are emerging in dozens of countries with South Africa at the center of the epidemic.According to introduction from health officials, the new cases detected in Gauteng province in the first week of December increased by 400%; according to test results, Omicron variant cases accounted for more than 90%.Thank you to all the supporters today; all 80 boxes have been given out!Ingredients of beauty soup:Functions of tremella: sweet in taste and neutral in nature, belong to channels of lung, stomach and kidney, have the effects of strengthening sperm, tonifying kidney, moistening intestine, nourishing stomach, tonifying vitality and blood, strengthening heart, nourishing yin, moistening lungs, promoting secretion, strengthening body, tonifying brain, refreshing beauty, tendering skin and prolonging life;

in fact, the price is usually in proportional to the degree of friendliness; if you are not able to distinguish, then expensive ones usually are more friendly than cheaper ones, and the so called “entry-level” rackets are in fact industrial garbage.They are low in strength, and there will be too much vibration when the ball hits on it; it cannot withstand hard balls, and even professional cannot handle it.The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, we know you can’t learn to play it, and we know you're not willing to buy expensive ones, so we make a cheap one to fool you; you won't play it again after using it once or twice; since the racket is cheap, you don't feel it's a waste.If you can tell the difference, it means you have made improvement; then you can come here to buy the expensive ones and I will make money twice.I recommend you to spend the same amount of money on a better-quality second hand racket such as prince or DUNLOP; these two brands are not famous, and so even if they are good, they are not expensive; you can get a new one with 500 or 600 yuan and a second hand one with 200 yuan; isn’t it nice to have a thousand yuan racket with only so little money?It’s friendly to newbies, but once you passed that stage, it will become not so useful; but most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newbie stage.The delivery time of the order has been put off multiple times.Could you help follow up on it?Delayed.Thank you.That is to say, I actually already have credit?Do I need to re-place the order next? So I can just ignore the previous order, right?Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, and after I received the delivery I found a lot of things were missing and the Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce was raw.#PRS_ORG# said I wanted to pick it up myself for no reason at all, please cancel it.All my orders are delivery orders, and there has been no request of self pickup.Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural elementary school teachers of music, PE and fine art in three years - XinhuanetMessage from Xinhua News Agency Nanchang on May 22 (journalist: Chen Yushan): According to Ministry of Education of Jiangxi, in order to strengthen the supportability for teachers of subjects that are in short supply and realize balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, Jiangxi province planned to train 1 music teacher, 1 art teacher and 1 PE teacher who are qualified for each elementary school in rural areas of the whole province (villages, towns and below) in three years since 2016; a total of 10 thousand teachers will be trained.It is understood that the training objects this time are teachers of other subjects under 45 years old with basic knowledge or talent of music, art and PE in rural primary schools in Jiangxi and can work as music, art or PE teachers at the same time.Through training, they can master basic knowledge and teaching skills of the subjects of music, PE and art, and update teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus cultural ability and self-development ability; a team of music, PE and art teachers who are good at many subjects and specialize in one will be constructed to relieve the problem of lack of music, PE and art teachers in rural schools.In order to ensure training quality and effect, Jiangxi plans to train 1 music, 1 art and 1 PE trainers for each elementary school in 100 counties (cities and districts) in Jiangxi, with a total of 300 trainers, to comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leading ability, teaching research activity design and organization ability, training ability, network research workshop construction ability, so as to teach, demonstrate, guide and supervise.It will be one hour and #NUMBER# minutes if I have to wait another 20 minutes.I don’t want food made one hour earlier.I found the buyer with the wrong order.But my wheel pie is missing.Hello, how much longer will the ordered food arrive?They have wrapped up.The number and name of your delivery person is #PHONENUMBER# and #NAME#.Please offer me a reasonable solution.Sure, but your delivery person has some issue that needs to be dealt with.Could you check if it’s still on the road first?

they shall be of the length at around the knees, just covering the fat part of the thighs.The fat thighs will be shown if the skirt is too short.Skirts that are too long will make you look short and fat.If you are dressed in three sections, upper, middle and lower, you will naturally look taller; that is, use different colors for upper body, skirt and stockings, and you will look taller and slimmer.In fact, a lot of darker color clothes are what slightly overweight girls all have, which the author deeply agrees; dark colors are good methods to cover fatness of your bodies; in addition, noble and elegant black short shirts are best choices for slightly overweight girls.You will look slimmer in dark clothes, especially black short skirts.Wear stockings and low-key shoes if your calves are fat.The more common the better; the color shouldn’t be too bright.In case people will notice your legs and feet and think you’re fat.Slightly overweight girls shall master the tricks for clothing matching.Slightly overweight girls shall never wear close-fitting short skirts and the upper outer garment shall not be too short or tucked inside the skirt, which seem strange; slightly overweight girls with thicker legs shall wear black stockings or mesh stockings (thin meshes), a flare skirt with print pattern and soft texture, and a loose-collar upper outer garment to cover the defects of the body.Of course, there are some skills for slightly overweight girls to wear short skirts.When slightly overweight girls wear short skirts, they shall choose upper outer garment with the same color as the short skirt, so as to make them look taller.Wearing skirt with a pair of high heels will make your legs seem slimmer and longer, which is the most fashionable outfit in summer!Girls with fat upper body and slim legs shall choose short dress of luxurious style.It can not only cover the fat stomach, but also show your advantages.A-line skirt makes people seem slimmer and is suitable for fat girls;

by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - XinhuanetMessage from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College.Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day.According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level.According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process.As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants.Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years.Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts.They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students.The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet.Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US.I need tableware.I just canceled the order.Why is it still in progress?Can you check for me if it has been canceled?But I placed the order at 5:9 in

Zhangting Village in Zhejiang through an estate agent and decided to purchase it after seeing it on-site for a few times.In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with Lin, a family member of the house owner, about the details of the purchase of the plant, and remitted 200,000 yuan as a deposit by bank transfer on the same day.Lin signed as the payee on the Receipt of the Deposit for the Purchase and Sale of the Plant, which stated that if the buyer does not to buy the plant, the deposit belongs to the seller; if the seller does not want to sell the plant, the deposit will be returned to the seller in double; both parties agree to sign the plant purchase and sale contract within one week. ”However, both parties failed to reach an agreement on the main items in the contract including the scope of the sale of the plant and method of payment, and as a result, they were delaying the signing of the plant purchase and sale contract.Considering they have not reached an agreement on the content of the contract, Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 to Mr. Lu a few days later.Mr. Lu was helpless and angry because he had a hard time finding the plant, paid the deposit, prepared the payment and was waiting for the contract to be signed, but the seller didn’t want to sell it anymore.For this, Mr. Lu decided to sue Lin at the Yuyao People’s Court.After the hearing, the court held that the two parties failing to sign a formal contract could not be attributed only to the defendant, but should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed; therefore, the deposit penalty should not be applied in this case, and the defendant should not bear the liability for breach of contract and return twice the deposit.After the judgment of the first instance, the plaintiff appealed again.Recently, the court of second instance upheld the original judgment.[Reminder from attorney] In the process of trading, we should perform necessary duty of prudence.When signing the contract, the buyer should perform necessary duty of prudence, such as verifying the information of the house owner and whether the house is occupied, and specify the specific time and place of delivery in the contract, so as to prevent disputes between the two parties during the performance of the contract.OK, I just worry that he will deliver it to the wrong address.Richang Restaurant

instead, they threw the country in a state of devastation and countless killing and destruction.Let us click on the video and reveal the truth of bloodthirsty killing in the name of “anti-terrorism” of the US, and rip off the false mask of American democracy!The delivery was late, and after the food got cold, it was dry and hard, completely inedible.Also the soup was spilled.Cancel it immediately, the stuff he #PRS_ORG# resends here must be cold.I didn’t take it!#NAME# said no one went to pick it up.We called.I’ll call the police if you don’t refund it.I’ve used #PRS_ORG# many times, and today I had the worst experience.Totally unacceptable.Okay, fine.But you need to remind the restaurant and delivery person.To prevent it from happening again.I want to know the exact delivery time.The time kept being put off.I don’t know how much longer do I have to wait.If I cancel the order, can I get the money back?I want to pay service fee to the delivery person, how can I do it?It was confirmed more than an hour ago that there was a delivery person.Not willing to wait any longer.Don’t scare people off at the starting line - XinhuanetWe can usually feel the popularity of books on success when we go to bookstores.Many books on success nowadays advocate the “best principle”, which first assumes or implies that you can “do it”, and then tell you “what it is” that you need to do.It skips the most important and fundamental link of “how to do it”.As such, these books have one common characteristic; you either work to be the best or do nothing at all; you either be 100 or be 0; you either climb on Mount Tai or stay where you are.The “best principle” will make every reader believe it is “absolutely right”, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.Because this theory advocates a route in which “you have to be resolute to start again and change 180 degrees”, and this happens to be the weakest point of many people.Shouting “you need to change” to people who stick to the rules, follow the old ways, and refuse to change is lying to yourself and casting pearls before swine.The majority of people will be timid in front of “change”, reluctant to move forward or make the decision; or, they have made the decision to “change” on an impulse and bravely taken the first step, but it doesn’t last long and they will lose courage after persevering for while; they cannot be persistent.From Tomorrow On, the famous sketch from Mr. Ma Sanli, most vividly depicts the classic of “common humanity”.The biggest problem of the “best principle” is the threshold is too high; it surpasses the limit of the ability of ordinary people and leave most people “sigh at the beginning”.Or, the “second best principle” perhaps is a route for more ordinary people to be successful.The core of the “second best principle” is lowering the threshold; it encourages “accumulating small successes to have big success”; even if you cannot reach 100, you can be 1, because 1 is always bigger than 0; if you cannot climb on Mount Tai, you can climb on the small dune in front of your house, because that is still better than marching on the spot.Anyway, doing anything is better than doing nothing at all.Due to the dramatic lowering of the threshold, the possibility of ordinary people persevering with it is higher; the success rate will be higher for anything as long as you persevere,It’s just that the journey will be longer if you follow the “second best principle”.In all, although the “best principle” on the surface claims to make everyone successful, it will eventually only encourage few people in actuality; the “second best principle” can effectively encourage more people and make more people actually gain benefit.Do I need to re-place the order now?The phone was not answered.Kept being delayed.Still not delivered.May I ask when it will arrive?How do I gain contact?Please cancel the order.I can’t wait any longer, thanks.He still has two food orders to deliver, but one order has completed.I want to know how to contact the delivery person.The first delivery person told me that another delivery person would send it again.The reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in the Qinghai Lake have increased by 7.1 thousand tons - XinhuanetReport from Xinhua News Agency Xining on December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) Reporters learned from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province that the latest monitoring results showed that the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources increased by 7,100 tons this year compared with the previous year, reaching 108,500 tons; there is a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared with that in the initial stage of protection in 2002.Gymnocypris przewalskii, commonly known as “scaleless carp”, is a unique and precious fish species in the Qinghai Lake, which plays an indispensable role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the “water, fish, bird” ecological chain in Qinghai Lake Basin.In the 1960s and 1970s, the number of gymnocypris przewalskii has decreased sharply due to the human hunting in vast quantities and the increasingly degraded environment of breeding waters of gymnocypris przewalskii, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources in Qinghai Lake in 2002 were only 2,592 tons.In 2004, gymnocypris przewalskii was listed as an endangered species in the Red List of Chinese Species.From 2003, Qinghai province implemented the closure of lakes for fish breeding, prohibited any unit, collective or individual from fishing gymnocypris przewalskii in the main rivers and tributaries in the lake area, and prohibited the sale of gymnocypris przewalskii and their products.In the meantime, the reserves of gymnocypris przewalskii resources have increased year by year through artificial breeding and releasing, clearing of the main rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake and river courses, designing scientific and reasonable “fish passage” and other measures to continue to strengthen protection.Yang Lin, Deputy Director General of Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that up until now, nearly 180 million gymnocypris przewalskii have been artificially reproduced and released, contributing more than 23% to the recovery of gymnocypris przewalskii resources.Qinghai three-rivers area is an important ecological barrier and water conservation area in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area to control the eastward spread of desertification in the west.In order to protect the ecological environment of the three rivers area and the waters of Qinghai Lake, protect aquatic wildlife, and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has issued a notice banning fishing in the key waters of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake since this year, and established a comprehensive management system of fishing ban of “one river, one river, and one lake”.I ordered food worth over $180 with #PRS_ORG# RED credit card.But the order didn’t deduct the $20.authentic software free trial on both computer and mobile phone non-paper version2022 Ye Zinan Advanced English and Chinese Translation Theory and Practice (Edition 2) Notes and Detailed Explanation of Real Exam Questions/Graduate Students Examinations Outline Support Materials and Review Materials Entrance Examinations2022 Ye Zi Modern Television Journalism notes and after-class questions (including typical questions) Detailed Explanation/Graduate Students Examinations Outline Support Materials Review Materials Entrance Examinations QuestionsAuthentic, Elementary Introduction to Mobile Photography, Making Shooting Beautiful Photos Easy, Tutorial of Snap Shots, Techniques of Photographic Composition and Lighting, Mobile Photography Tutorial, App and Software Photography EditingQuality books guaranteed to be authentic, with quality services and fast delivery and no worries about after-sale serviceRed Hat Linux System Management Complete Collection (with CD)Shen Shixi, King of Animal Novel, Book Collection: Tiger Baby Gold Leaves [Please contact customer service if you need group purchase]Book information was collected and uploaded by software, and if there is any error in the information, please refer to the physical copy you received, and please do not buy it if you mind it!Please contact online service if you have any questions!The restaurant only gave me one bag of it, and it needs to be put in a bag because it’s cold.May I ask if the food delivery was put in one bag?We only see one bag.I want to know if it was missed or someone took it, thanks.It has been 1 hour and it still has not been delivered yet.Today is the Winter Solstice, and delivering the wrong thing is quite disappointing.Please place another order for the children.I hope the store can set aside some time out of its busy schedule to check the quality of the products.Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you.As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options.According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk.“Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!”Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it.Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function.Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it.Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc.But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin.There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated.Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it.The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened - Headline of viewpoints - Hunan Daily - Huasheng OnlineMessage from Hunan Daily on December 10 (all-media journalists: Zhang Shangwu and Hu Panpan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, photographer: Li Jian) The 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and Xinhua Black Tea Introduction and Marketing Event were held in Hunan International Expo Center this morning to exhibit tea industry, innovate tea science and technology, advocate tea culture and accelerate the process of realizing the industry objective of 100 billion.Hou Shunli, deputy director of the Council of China National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Head Office, and Ye Hongzhuan, deputy director of the Standing Committee of Provincial People’s Congress, attended the opening ceremony.Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced at the opening ceremony: Xinhua is the source of Hunan Black Tea, and the emerging of the black tea injects new energy into the “colorful Hunan tea”.In recent years, the provincial Party committee and the provincial government have vigorously supported the development of the tea industry, promoted the construction of the Hunan tea industry of 100 billion and formed the development pattern of “three Xiang, four rivers, and five colors of tea”.The tea industry of the province has been promoting innovation, and main tea types such as green tea and black tea take turns to generate power; tea-travel integration is promoted in main tea production areas to drive income increase of tea farmers.Every type of tea takes turns to gain its spotlight, and now it is time for black tea.According to opinion of experts in the tea industry in the province, tea farmers pick black tea after green tea and have income in all four seasons, making the production value of tea gardens soar.At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded plates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the trademark of “Hunan black tea”, and Xinhua was awarded the title of “source of Hunan black tea”.In the exhibition hall of Xinhua black tea, a tea merchant from Fujian took a fancy to a high mountain tea named “spring in ice” and placed an order immediately.Wang Zhun, secretary-general of provincial tea association, said happily that factors such as epidemic exert an impact on the tea market to a certain extent; however, based on the situations at the tea expo, there are various highlights.The red color of Xinhua black tea has instilled the essence of tea culture, and with its popularity and hot transactions, the Hunan tea industry is ushering in a new spring.If the food is not warm, can I cancel it?I don’t want it anymore, he didn’t come up and deliver it to me because parking was not allowed down there.#NUMBER# yuan has been received, and it was for the missed food.Yang Xingche, real name Jiang Bo, was born in the month of the sheep in the year of the sheep;

the makeup products were also from leading brands.Not to mention Tian Liang, who is really a professional photographer.The whole studio is artistic, and there are two kittens to play with you.We work in Beijing, and better studios in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance; I have a colleague who did the photoshoot in Beijing and felt the photos were just so so.I specifically found this studio, a place with soul and attitude.Our facial expression management was poor, and I think this is a problem for most people, but photographer Liang is good at capturing the natural and wonderful moments.A brilliant team with makeup artist, photographer and post-editing design.After the photos came out, we and everyone around us were full of praises for them.I have recommended my girlfriend to come, who was also satisfied with the photos.I hope studio like this will get the attention it deserves and more people can discover it and shoot photos with their own style instead of being the same as everyone else.Thank you to Zhanying and Jinglung for your five-star reviews, you are both creative new comers;

after all, trainings are expensive and it will take you six months to learn it.However, if you want to enter this industry, then training is a great option, especially for those who are extremely not self-disciplined.You can choose to teach yourself if you are self-disciplined, but it will be tiring.Certainly, selecting a good training agency is very important.You need to first look at the faculty of this agency; if it’s not strong enough, you can cross that agency off your list; of course, some new agencies don’t have strong faculties.Secondly, you shall do some research on the agency before choosing it; it’s best to contact former students of the agency; after all, only students know how the agency really is and whether the curriculum is good or not.Hello, actually I’m not sure how to answer your question since you didn’t introduce your own situation, and learning this is closely related to your situation.Such as your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even which city you are in; all of these are related to what you want to learn or what industry you want to go into.If you are a student who haven’t graduated yet, or if you are a computer major and have graduated, then I recommend learning it yourself if you have time, and this is the method with lowest efficiency and cost; many offline and online training agencies are good now, but it comes with great cost and takes a lot of time; it basically needs a concentrated training of three to six months.However, if you are in the same situation as I mentioned, it is convenient to learn it yourself; many learning resources are free online, or you can gain access to a lot of training resources on Bilibili; if you don’t know how to search for them, you can contact me according to my bio and get free resources or detailed consultation.There are also classic books to supplement your study with videos.If you are not a computer major, but you can pay certain amount of money and devote your time to your learning, then I suggest you go to an agency to study; it’ll be easier this way as the teachers will explain in detail and there will be designated people answering your questions; in addition, it’ll be helpful to your study planning or help you get supervision.Further, many training agencies will sign employment agreement; they have quota for internal promotion, and you can be recommended to a company after your learning, so that the job interview process can be easier.The above is my opinion; as I said, I don’t know about your situation so my introduction is not detailed; if you want to consult other things, you may contact me any time.I said it should arrive before 1 o’clock, and I’ve seen it in the App.What is the...I haven’t finished speaking, what are you doing?I undertake all kinds of housekeeping services including installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall mounted water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, range hood, lamp installation, glass cleaning, and professional sewing.Thanks to everyone who liked my post;

we are serious about creating exquisite things with our attention to details, and we are serious about cleaning seams.Give me a chance and you will be satisfied; quality is everything, because professionalism is worth trusting; your recognition is the best encouragement to me!At present, there is not one industry that is easy to do!But I always believe that as long as I am serious, persistent and hard-working, I will be slightly better than others; it’s at least better than sitting around and complaining!”Morning is the most important time of the day; all the good things begin in the morning; I hope you can start a new day with happiness, luck, health and joy; keep a good mood all day long; good morning.When we were children, happiness was a thing, and we were happy when we had it; when we grow up, happiness is a goal, and we will be happy when we reach it; after maturity, I found that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding is happiness.Be the truest and kindest self, act according to your heart, and leave no regrets in your life; life is a road, go your own way; there are two treasures in life: good health and good mood, and you will live a beautiful life!We will encounter different difficulties in different stages of life.Often times, what is restraining you is not you ability but your courage to face it actively.Since you cannot hide, you’d rather face it.The more scared you are, the easier you will be knocked down by difficulties; if you take it head on, the problem will be solved.Exhibition planners of China and Saudi Arabia work together to hold the first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia - XinhuanetMessage from Xinhua News Agency Riyadh on December 12 (journalists: Wang Haizhou and Hu Guan): The first contemporary art biennale of Saudi Arabia, Diriyah contemporary art biennale, was officially opened to the public in the JAX arts district of Diriyah in the northwest of Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on December 11, and a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China and other countries and regions participated in the exhibition.The biennale is planned jointly by Diriyah biennale foundation of Saudi Arabia and UCCA of China, and Tian Feiyu, curator of UCCA of China, works as the art director.According to the introduction from the planning team, the theme of the biennale is “crossing the river by feeling the stones”, which is a metaphor of the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transition period and reflects the current situations of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.The biennale occupies an area of nearly twelve thousand square meters, and the exhibition hall stretches across six connected buildings with six units: Crossing the River by Feeling the Stones, Inheritance as an Experiment, Thinking at the Edge, Walking to the Public, Beautiful New Word and On the Spirit of Arts.In which the number of the works of the 27 artists from Saudi Arabia accounts for more than 40% of the total number of the exhibits, including various art forms such as drawing, installation art and performing art; the works of the 12 Chinese artists also attracted much attention, and some artists create with recycled materials in an innovative way; for example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting with wastes in Behind the Story Series, Picture of Endless Streams and Mountains (2014).According to Buckley, CEO of Diriyah biennale foundation, it is hoped that the biennale can establish an international dialogue, provide global audiences with opportunities to understand the vigorously developed culture industry and innovative communities in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interactions.Tian Feiyu said, “The biennale has two objectives, i.e., establishing dialogue between contemporary art of Saudi Arabia and the world, and integrating audiences of Saudi Arabia into the contemporary art world.”It is understood that there will be a series of lectures during the biennale, and artists, exhibition planners and leaders of innovative industries will engage in discussions on cross-cultural communication, contemporary art development and other topics.I ordered axe-handle steak.The restaurant told me the delivery person could not deliver bones.I want to ask why.The bones are okay, ask the restaurant to wrap them up separately and deliver them.But the system was not easy to use, and I normally used the other room.I’m at #ADDRESS#, the branch store at Meixinli.I’m far from that place.Practical Oral Business English Scenarios 100+ Business Oral English Encyclopedia (with multiple gifts for practicing oral English)10 minutes every day, and one with no foundation can speak easily!Cover all common business themed scenarios, include all commonly used business English expressions, explain all business English communication skills!Complimentary oral English simulation exercises + foreign teachers' reading audio + free download of universal business common sense, easily improve oral business English!Practical Oral Business English Scenarios 100 by Wang Huili, Zhan Lili, Wang Yucui, authentic books directly from China Aerospace Publishing House, official electronic invoice can be provided, please contact online customer service any time if you have any question!5 Minutes of English Before Bed, Classics That Have Been Passed Down from A Hundred Years Ago, translated by Yang Chunli, Cheng Yingcui, Song Bing 9787512415812 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics PressAuthentic books, electronic invoice, quality after-sale services, please consult online customer service if you have any question.Very Valentine by Adriana Trigiani, translated by Dong Yannan, Chen Huijie, 9787513306645, New Star Press [direct dispatch]Authentic books directly provided by publishing house, official electronic invoice available, please contact online customer service if you have any question!100% Beautiful and Confident by Kampwerth (German) [authentic book]Get deduction if your order reaches certain amount in store, lots of discounts, come and shop![Wenxuan Authentic] Practical Oral Business English Scenarios 100Xinhua Wenxuan Authentic Books (Jiangsu, Chengdu, Hubei, Tianjin) the nearest of the four warehouses will dispatch, and 75% of cities can enjoy next day delivery!Autism Explained to Non-Autistic Persons by Kim Thuy (Canadian) and Brigitte Harrisson (Canadian) [authentic] [authentic book]Beautiful English, the Breathtaking Letters (Letters Volume) (800 extensive knowledge points, 1000 authoritative essays, 2000 classic quotes 3) [authentic books] [authentic books]Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize management of rural public welfare posts - XinhuanetMessage from Xinhua News Agency Kunming on December 12 (journalist: Lin Bifeng): In order to continue to provide assistance to the employment of people lifted out of poverty, consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation work, Yunnan Province has released policies on the management of public welfare position in villages for promoting rural revitalization, as a way to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.As introduced by person-in-charge of Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Yunnan, a total of 448.3 thousand rural public welfare positions have been developed in Yunnan to solve the employment of rural groups with difficulties such as labor force lifted out of poverty; they play an important role in helping people lifted out of poverty obtain employment and increase income, consolidating achievements of poverty relief and effectively improving rural public service abilities.The new regulation is jointly printed and issued by seven departments such as the Department of Human Resources and Social Security, Rural Revitalization and Department of Finance of Yunnan, which mainly provides unified regulations on object scope, fund management, post development and post management of applicants of rural public welfare positions.In terms of position development and setting, it is clearly stipulated in the new regulation that the positions are set according to the principles of “setting positions according to demands, designating personnel according to positions, dynamic management and total quantity control”, “the unit that develops and utilizes the positions shall be responsible for them” and “one position with one person, voluntariness, publicity and unified management”The recruitment procedures must be conducted in accordance the steps of announcement, application, review, making public notice, employment, pre-job training and taking up the post.In addition, the new regulation also specifies the specific duties of the main development department as well as the subsidy standard and method of the rural public welfare positions; it is stipulated that the development departments of rural public welfare positions shall purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for people taking rural public welfare positions; responsible departments are required to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution of rural public welfare positions.The address is wrong.Hello,Can I cancel the order?I will re-place the order.Is it canceled yet?2. Although the Rightists had their time in history, it was not long, and the reason why it was short was they were over their head once they got a tiny bit of sweetness; a little success will lead to insatiable desires, and just one blow and they will lose their ground to exist.But to speak the truth, the Rightists have once played a positive role in the process of social progress.The positive significance of the Rightists should not be denied in terms of ending the cultural revolution, defining the standard of truth, developing the economy, improving science and technology, and promoting the institutionalization of administration and the protection of human rights.3. For me, although I don’t fully agree with some of Li Weidong’s statements, I really care about his statements and respect Li Weidong; Because he is conscientious, he is serious about China, and he also takes China’s social problems seriously.But I oppose his anti-communist theory; I believe that unnecessary revolution should be opposed to; revolution will inevitably lead to social unrest and damage to people’s livelihood; political groups will be mixed, and foreign countries will avail themselves of the opportunity to get in.4. Changing or improving China requires patience and the attitude to be responsible for the country and the people; those who try to make money from political opportunities are not Rightists, but bastards.Let’s talk about Leftists.Leftists, in fact, are a group of outcasts of the times and politics.If the Rightists are of positive significance to society, and the Communist Party will listen to some of the Rightists’ remarks and analyze their thoughts when necessary, the Leftists don’t have such luck, because what the Leftists want is the dross thrown away by the Communist Party!5. Recently, I saw some friends refuting the rebels and crazy Leftists at the same time, and they got really angry; I don't think it’s necessary at all.Don’t try to reason with rebels and crazy Leftists; they are all one track minded and unreasonable.Don’t try to prove we are right, and don’t even think about asking rebels and crazy Leftists to admit it; why bother?I told my friends: when the rebels call you a fifty-cent and when the leftist call you a rightist dog, they prove we are on the correct track in the middle!Many people had dreams when they were young, but they forgot about them when they got older; or, they pursue their dreams and become paranoid.They drift apart from their dreams and the young Dragon Slayer will eventually become a vicious dragon.I think left and right generally refers to restraint and freedom; the innate genes of China’s history and culture make China overall relatively left.The domestic Rightists are free and stress efficiency and development, while the Leftists strengthen supervision and pay more attention to fairness and safety.At present, society overall hopes to pay more attention to justice; at the same time, it is certain that when China and the United States fight, it is bound to lean towards left, which is estimated to continue for many years.Just like it if you don’t understand.No need to say more, Huahua is generous.I won’t wait any more.It will be 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06😅Let’s see some “strange trending topics” today.What is normal public opinion?Select three trending topics randomly, the rise of the head of the dragon on the 2nd of February, the price rise of ORLON, and the Huolala incident; the public opinion spread to form a peak, and then the [index declined] to form a (smooth curve) until it finally dissipated; if a secondary public opinion occurs, there will be a small hump again.They look no different from the [evolution model of online public opinion] once displayed on the official website of Cyberspace Administration.What is abnormal public opinion?Randomly select three trending topics from the same event, there are [solitary peak], [zigzag] and [cliff].[Solidary peak] means the topic is artificially heated, quickly rushing to the trending topics list and attracting public attention; [Zigzag] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that topic stays on the trending topics list; [Cliff] means collective evacuation; after the topic has played its “function”, they received a new task and rushed to a new battlefield.In picture 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event happens to be the trough of another event, and the time is exactly the same; it must be because a unified batch of paid internet trolls have received the task and started a new round of offensive.The professionalism of black public relations can be seen: dozens of trending topics are on the list at the same time, which attract attention, which are responsible for explanation, which lead to argument and accumulate momentum, which divert attention, which affect understanding, which mislead judgment, which incite emotion, which coerce decision-making; the black production accounts work in batches and conduct segmented operations in different batches and time nodes, taking into account almost all elements in the spread of public opinion.Communication is a science which disregards all subjective factors such as standpoint and emotion and only takes into account objective data; black public relations will have nowhere to hide.Traces will be left from anyone walked by, and we can dig out these traces together.Source of data: trending topics time machine.Omicron strain infection cases were found in Mauritius and other countries for the first time - XinhuanetMessage from Xinhua News Agency Beijing on December 12, reported by foreign corespondent of comprehensive Xinhua News Agency: Mauritius, Cyprus and Malawi recently reported to have found the infection cases of Omicron strains, the new COVID-19 variant, for the first time.Mauritius reported two infection cases of Omicron strains on December 10 for the first time.According to introduction from Kelesh Jagutpal, Minister of Ministry of Health of Mauritius, one of the infected people was a tourist departing from South Africa and arriving in Mauritius on November 27; the other infected person was a local resident of Mauritius, who was tested positive in nucleic acid test on November 30 after contacting a person who returned from South Africa.The nucleic acid test results of the two infected people changed to negative after quarantine and receiving treatment in the hospital, and now they have returned to their own respective residence.It was announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that the country confirmed three cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.All of the 3 infected people were students who came back after traveling in other countries at the beginning of this month; all of them were not hospitalized because they were mild cases.In order to prevent the spreading of the Omicron strains, the government of Cyprus kept strengthening the prevention and control.All the passengers above 12 years old who enter the country by plane shall take nucleic acid test at their own expenses at the airport from December 6 to January 10 next year.It was also announced by Ministry of Health of Cyprus on December 10 that they would start inoculate children from 5 to 11 years old in the country with Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.Kunbizze Chiponda, Minister of Ministry of Health of Malawi, said on December 9 that Malawi found 3 cases of infection with the Omicron strains for the first time.The Department of Health of Malawi conducted genomic sequencing for 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9 to December 2 and found the 3 cases of infection.The takeout order never arrived.Even the number of the delivery person is fake.I have already re-placed the order.Will I get a refund for the last order?If it doesn’t work, please cancel the order and ask for a refund.I thought if I ordered early, I could eat it early, but now it’s 7 and I still don’t have it.I don’t understand what you are talking about...Was your Chinese translated? Or would you prefer English?Then send it toShall I tell him on the phone?Hello, deal customer!Thank you for choosing Zhi Yun Restaurant, and offering you a pleasant meal has been our mission; we are committed to providing you and your family with delicious food, quality service, and your satisfaction and good review will always be our momentum to move forward!Thank you for your 5-star review, lots of love!Thank you for choosing Zhi Yuan Restaurant, and we are deeply sorry for the trouble brought to you!At the same time, we are grateful for your review of your real experience so that we can timely find our shortcomings, and we will definitely take effective measures to make improvement, strictly control the quality and amount of dishes; we are “Xiao Yun” of Zhi Yun Restaurant and our phone number and WeChat account is 18912251735; we look forward to meeting you again.Hello, dear customer, thank you for choosing Zhi Yun Restaurant, and we are deeply sorry for your unpleasant dining experience due to the issues of the dishes; we have communicated with the kitchen to strictly control the quality of dishes, and we would like to thank you for your understanding and support for us at the same time; we are Xiao Yun of Zhi Yun Restaurant, and we look forward to meeting you again!Come to Zhi Yun and enjoy a pleasant meal!Dear customer, thank you for you comment and support for “Xiao Yun”, and it is our happiest moment to win your affirmation for the food we carefully cooked!We look forward to meeting you again.Dear customer, we would like to first thank you for your affirmation and comment, and Zhi Yun will work hard and get better and better!We would also love to thank you for your support and likes out of your busy schedule, and we wish you a happy meal time and good mood every day!I don’t think this act is helpful at all!What I received is tripe.The order is chicken feet.Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#.Do I need to stay in this conversation?I #NAME# called your staff to explain it.Your delivery person told me the address is too far.Damei 360 Integrated Home DecorationAddress: Happy Home Building 12, South Ring Road 156I trusted it because my friend made the recommendation, so I chose to check it out, and originally my budget for a basic decoration was 70,000.A series of scam began as soon as I came into the store.When I first came to the store, I showed them my floor plan; although they didn’t really go to my apartment to take the measurement, they said they could do it within 70,000 for my 135 square meters apartment, and they showed me their materials whose brand was unclear.The second scam was forcing you to pay the deposit, which cannot be refunded once paid, unless you have enough experience to reason with them.As I hesitated about whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell me that once I paid the deposit on that day, they could give me certain discount.This is a big swindle, and I was a victim who paid a deposit of more than 10,000 when I didn’t really think it through.Their quoted price had a lot of problems; for instance, the 70,000 didn’t include water and electricity renovation, doors, cabinets or bathrooms, and these three take up a large proportion of the cost of basic installation.Apart from these, their service point fee is also higher than that of other companies.I’ve lost trust in this company, because they asked me to sign the contract when they didn’t explain anything clearly.When I went to ask for a refund, they acted rather experienced and sent a small team to deal with me.Anyway, they just said it was the client’s problem and they had absolutely no responsibility for it.They just shrunk their responsibility in any way possible, and there were a lot more details that I don’t want to mention now; all in all, do not choose them because my friend had them renovate her apartment, and the quality was poor and they would charge you all kinds of other costs in the later stage.Swindle; they used to be the swindler company Longtou Renovation, then it’s changed to Damei, and now it seems they have closed down and changed into something else.So please don’t choose such a swindler company.When you choose renovation companies in the future, please search them on Baidu because renovation cost is not a small amount.If you want to ask the merchant a question, please log in or register first.It is strictly prohibited to publish any type of merchant review, and please refer to the Merchant Inclusion Statement for details.Dianping Kunming Renovation and Design Channel will provide you with the address, phone number, operation time and other information of Damei 360 Integrated Home Renovation, and please come to Dianping if you are looking for a renovation company.It’s so horrible, and I will cancel the order if it doesn’t arrive in 30 minutes!Is there really no other way? For example, change the address?OK, then don’t cancel this conversation, and I’ll pursue it further if I don’t receive the refund in 5 to 10 days.I asked if I could cancel it if it didn’t arrive in 15 minutes.Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce is supposed to be fully cooked, but what I received is raw and inedible.There has been no replies for three days, and as your system cannot identify my credit card, I can’t join the#PRS_ORG#plus monthly fee project!What is strange is that I paid with the same credit card every time.I have to pay the delivery fee every time now.It can be exempted, and you can charge me with the monthly fee after the investigation, is that Okay?Then how can I contact the food delivery person?It’s almost three o’clock.Then should you give me compensation?I said to knock before handing me the delivery.But the delivery person just left it at the door and left.And got it wrong.Your delivery person has picked up an order of mine at #NUMBER#, but I was told I still needed to wait.The delivery person picked up my takeout at 19:25, but still doesn’t want to set out.I’ll go buy it, and do you need any other takeout?What do I do?Where is your delivery person?Do I still need to wait?I asked for the food to be delivered.Okay, if you don’t cancel it, I’ll call the police.But there will be safety and health issues in my food.Classic Knife and Sword Appreciation Guide Hardcover Collector Edition [Authentic Book, Worry-free After-sale Services][Authentic Book, Fast Shipping, Worry-free Quality, Invoice Available]Classic Badge Appreciation Guide + Classic Knife and Sword Appreciation Guide + Classic Military Uniform Appreciation Guide Hardcover Collector Edition 3 volumes World Military Books Introduction of Functions of Classic Military Badges, Used in Military, Military Uniforms, Knife and SwordNine Lessons of Chinese Painting Appreciation and Collection Strategies [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping][Get deduction after reaching certain amount, fast dispatch after placing order, invoice available, authentic book]Western Knife and Sword: Appreciation and Collection [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Piano Skills Practice Guide [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Industrial Design Sketch Bible + Realization of Creativity + Performance by Luo Jian, Li Yu, Liang Jun, Tsinghua University Press [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Highlights of Auctioned Chinese Antiques: Porcelain English Edition [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Painting of the Nine Songs [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Illustrations of Dream of the Red Chamber [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]History of Chinese Paintings [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Illustrations of Woody Flowers and Birds [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Realism and Chinese Films in the 1980s [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Design of Chinese LOGO · 1 [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Illustrations of Herbaceous Flowers and Poems [Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Sword Archives Online 02: Aincrad [Authentic Book, Worry-Free After-Sale Services]Song Jianfeng - Small Works of Famous Figure Painter[Authentic Book, Fast Shipping]Just Law and Good Governance: Historical Lessons of Organizational System and the Gain and Loss of Administration of Officials“History and Culture Lectures for Ministerial Cadres” 20th Anniversary Essence Collector’s Edition, an open class dedicated to ministerial cadres by 14 leading historians, cultural masters and well-known scholars including Wang Chunyu, Zhang Dake, Xiong Zhaozheng, Ge Jianxiong, Deng XiaonanIt will be okay after the discount code is reimbursed.No problem, and remember not to arrange for a re-delivery, I have re-purchased it and I don’t want to cause any waste.Thank you for your help.I have been against any form of insult or abuse since the beginning, and I will not stand such personal attacks.In this civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we need to get rid of these bullies.If you don’t look at political parties and factions, it is this uncivilized actions that should be boycotted first.I never replied to you since you started to send me Facebook friend request, published ridicule posts, and then tried to post the so-called location of my home and my father’s name on social media.After that, you made it worse by not only continuing to tag me six times a day, but also continuing to wantonly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some obscure and humiliating remarks about me, my appearance, figure, shape fit for giving birth, getting love bites in bed, whether to penetrate or not, I... forget it.It was unexpected that more people sent me a photo uploaded to your Facebook friends page and your harassing comments.Sorry, I cannot be silent anymore as a girl.After the news of me calling the police was published, you did not restrain yourself at all, but became more arrogant.I don’t care about your political background or your identity or position; in our society, the two genders shall respect each other.Yes, you can continue with your ridicule, obscure, humiliating and abusive remarks; you can continue to say that you just care about and pay attention to me; you can continue to think that this is not harassment; you can even continue to deny that you made the pictures or continue to make all the offensive remarks.Yes, I can’t and won’t stop you.I don’t know you and I don’t want to know you, and my appearance and body don’t need you judgement.I don’t even think any girl would want to be famous by being humiliated like this.My friends asked me if I was okay.You won’t believe it if I say yes.I don’t think any girl could say they are okay after being bullied like this.No matter it’s in the workplace, society, politics or the business world, only those without basic moral character will harm a woman in this way.I believe justice is in everyone’s heart.I took screenshots of part of the comments and you can make your judgement.You posted it yourself, and no one will pretend to be you, right?I can only say you’re the enemy of civilization.SmileI have reported it and attached the pictures, but there has been no reply.What beef, I didn’t order beef.It is Poached Chicken with Chili Sauce, and it’s raw.It’s inedible.Are you sure the food was freshly cooked and not from before?That’s unacceptable.I’ve placed the order very early.It said it would be de delivered a little over seven o’clock.Why does it have to be re-made?It’s ridiculous.“Smart Hunan” 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened - Rolling News - Hunan Daily Online - Huasheng OnlineReport from Hunan Daily on December 10 (all-media journalist: Zhou Zhiheng), on December 9, “Smart Hunan” 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Zhuzhou.Wang Cheng, a member of the Standing Committee of CPC Provincial Committee and Director of the Organization Department of Provincial Party Committee, attended the opening ceremony and delivered a speech.Wang Cheng pointed out that hosting the talent summit was an important measure to implement the spirit of the talent working conference of the central government and the spirit of the 12th Party Congress of Hunan, showing the sincerity of Hunan in terms of putting emphasis on talents, being eager for talents and making full use of talents.With the good tradition of recognizing talents, cherishing talents and respecting talents, the wide platforms that assist in talent development and the environmental conditions for realizing beautiful life, Hunan has implemented the talent development strategy in recent years, and has constructed the full-chain talent work pattern by taking Furong talent action plan as the pulling strength, forming the fertile soil for talent growth and achievement, the favored place for innovation and entrepreneurship, and the paradise for living and working.At present, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the “three-high and four-new” strategic positioning and mission tasks, and will further introduce talents, provide more policies for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, concentrate more resources and create better conditions;
