Feels very meaningful - First Aid Certificate
This is a skill certificate that I think is important, besides my driver's license!
Promote the knowledge: Emergency rescue measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken in the event of an emergency, that is, rescue before the arrival of the ambulance.
Everyone knows that there is still a period of time after the accident when the ambulance arrives, and it is exactly this period of time that is the most critical.
Translation:  Now is the time that requires urgent help.
If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, and stop breathing, then our window of life only has four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So, how important it is for people around you to know first aid!
When someone falls down near us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is too helpless and terrifying.
In China, official data shows that there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is sudden cardiac arrest.
In the United States, on average, 15% of people can be saved.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved. Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Luo Le, said.
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no pulse, performing CPR on them is useless.
It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions in order to potentially save a person.
I have found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when things happen, it's too late to regret it. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations.
It's not certain whether we can save a person's life!
Emergency First Aid certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. There are also discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve by the time I was 25 years old. Adding the emergency rescue certificate to the goal list was a few months ago, but I did accomplish it!
After that, I plan to take other certifications that I want to take, such as the diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving emergency certification, and it seems that you need to have the emergency certification to take the diving certification. So actually, the emergency certification is still very useful!

The Chongqing Municipal Vocational School has launched a pilot program for the modern apprenticeship system, where students enter as trainees and become company employees upon graduation. The news was reported by Xinhua Net.
Yesterday, reporters from the local education bureau learned that starting this year, our city will pilot "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 vocational schools, and students who participate in the pilot training will have the status of both apprentices and students. After being admitted, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees.
The municipal education committee requires that vocational schools standardize the recruitment and selection of engineering programs for enterprises, clarify the dual identity of apprentices as students of vocational schools and enterprise trainees, and adopt a reciprocal selection principle. Apprentices, schools, and enterprises must sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who have turned 16 but have not yet turned 18, the agreement must be signed by the apprentice, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement must specify the rights and obligations of each party, as well as the specific job training, teaching content, and benefits guaranteed for the apprentice.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-style training and cooperate with enterprises to conduct pre-employment training and on-the-job training for employees.
The pilot schools need to reform their talent cultivation mode.
The school and enterprises jointly designed a talent training plan, jointly formulated professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The trial period is set as an experimental period for cultivating the curriculum, and the duration of the internship for students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan, with a general internship period of 6 months.
In order to implement the enterprise team-based management mode in corporate practice, according to the characteristics of different professions, one teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students master the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will be divided into three batches to determine 60 municipal-level modern apprentice positions, with each batch having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained.
According to the principle of gradually expanding from pilot testing, from point to surface, exploring the long-term mechanism of establishing school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated cultivation of talents, and effectively improving students' job skills and increasing their employment rate and job quality.

A South African doctor said that although the transmission power of the omicron variant is strong, it mainly infects people with mild symptoms.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus causes milder symptoms than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the US media, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's general manager, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he has to see dozens of patients every day, but there are no patients who need to be hospitalized.
"Pili said: 'They can control their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation.'"
He said that includes elderly patients and those with health problems, these groups of people are originally more likely to fall into severe illness due to coronavirus infection.
He said, compared to the previous wave of the Delta variant of COVID-19, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will have to stay in the hospital for several days.
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences.
Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks of time, the doctor's observation and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; in recent cases, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early cases in South Africa was 20%.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, Willem Hanekom, referring to data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said: "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said: "Now is still the early stage, we need to obtain posterior data."
In most cases, hospitalization and death occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks.
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still the dominant strain of COVID-19 globally, cases of Omicron have been reported in several countries, with South Africa being at the center of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the Dominican Republic increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests have shown that more than 90% of the cases are caused by the Omicron variant.

Yang Haitao spoke about the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English:  Draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle  Note: This is a famous quote from Mao Zedong, the former Chairman of the Communist Party of China. It is often used to inspire and motivate people to work hard and persevere in the face of challenges.
According to an article in the Hunan Daily on December 10th (reporter Chen Baowei), based on a unified arrangement by the provincial committee, provincial committee member and propaganda department minister Yang Hai'e conducted an interactive lecture at the video creative park in Mabanshan on December 10th morning, deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on the development of Hunan, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress.
Yang Haoteng, from the perspective of ideological beliefs and original mission, self-revolution and youthful enthusiasm of the Party, as well as the leadership of the Party and its theories, has comprehensively and systematically explained the core essence and practical requirements of the spirit of the whole meeting based on his own insights and personal experiences.
He pointed out that it is important to combine the spirit of the whole meeting and the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congress, and to study and implement them in a integrated and coordinated manner, so as to strengthen the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two safeguards", and unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping.
During the interactive communication segment, representatives from the grassroots level, enterprises, and youth groups asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, the significance of "two establishments" in terms of decision-making, how cultural enterprises can seize the initiative, and how new generations of youth can draw strength from the Party's century-long history. Yang Hai'e responded to these questions with plain language and vivid examples, urging young Party members to draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle and to tightly unite around the Central Committee, remaining steadfast and unwavering in their commitment to the Party and using their youth to fulfill their responsibilities and shoulder their burdens.

"I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a coach with a similar price range first."
Unfriendly, in fact, price often corresponds to the degree of friendliness, if you cannot distinguish, then the normal situation of the expensive will be more friendly than the cheap shot, this kind of "entry shot" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when a ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even with a hard ball, it's difficult for top players to control it.
The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll make something cheap and sloppy for you to play with, you'll play twice, and then you won't play anymore, this way, this shot is cheap, and you won't feel bad.
Wait until you can truly distinguish between good and bad, indicating that you have made progress, and then come to my store to buy expensive things. I will earn twice as much money.
Here's the translation:  "It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money on a second-hand camera that's in good condition, choose between Prince or Tuellup brands. These two brands don't have a strong reputation, so good cameras don't sell for a high price. A new camera around 500-600 yuan is good, while a second-hand one for 200 yuan offers the same experience as a thousand-yuan camera. Wouldn't it be nice to enjoy a camera worth a thousand yuan for only 200 yuan?"
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once you pass the newcomer stage, I become cold. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newcomer stage.

In fact, there are many discussions about the clothing matching for girls with a slim body.
The skirt of a fat girl should not be too short or too long, and the length difference should be around the knee. It should be just long enough to cover the fat thighs.
The phrase "裙子过短" means "skirt is too short" in Chinese. In English, it can be translated as "The skirt is too short" or "The dress is too short".  The phrase "把腿上的肥胖显露出来" means "exposes fat on the thighs" in Chinese. In English, it can be translated as "exposes fat on the thighs" or "reveals fat on the thighs".
"过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉" can be translated to "Prolonged exposure will give people a feeling of being short and fat."
If you wear a top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt in different colors, it will make you look taller, as the colors of the upper body, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt create a sense of length.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the standard attire for chubby girls (a point that the author feels deeply). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat, and high-class black short dresses are the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothing, especially a black short skirt, will make you look thinner.
If you have fat legs, don't wear your socks and shoes too tightly, so that people don't notice.
The more people like it, the better it is. The color should not be too bright either.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet, making people feel fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to teach them how to dress appropriately.
Don't let the girl wear tight short skirts, and don't wear the upper body too short or stuffed in the skirt, it will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear a black long-sleeved turtleneck or mesh turtleneck (with a fine grid pattern), choose a soft and comfortable printed jumpsuit, and match it with a ruffled shirt, which can effectively cover the shortcomings of fat girls.
Of course, slim girls also pay attention to what they wear when they wear short skirts.
The girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will make her appear taller.
Short skirts can be paired with high-heeled shoes to make your legs look even more slender and elegant. This is the hottest summer outfit, isn't it?
If you are an MM who is overweight in the upper body but has skinny legs, I recommend choosing a short dress with a glamorous feel.
Not only can it block the big belly, but it can also showcase your strengths.
The short skirt will look very slender, which is more suitable for chubby girls. When choosing a top, it is recommended to choose a tight-fitting one to create a layered effect, which will make you look even slimmer.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  A simple and white T-shirt can be paired with a short skirt, even MM can try it.
The phrase "微胖的女孩也是能够穿出时尚感的" is a Chinese sentence that translates to "Even a thin girl can dress stylishly."
As long as you can master the rules of dressing appropriately, even overweight girls will become the focus of everyone's attention.
After making changes in clothing coordination, it is also important to exercise more in daily life and try to get rid of the label of "micro obesity" as early as possible 😄

This time, our team brought this car to everyone, which is many men's dreams!
It is the flagship sports car of Lamborghini, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4!
To translate the text from Chinese to English:  The price of this car is close to two million yuan, and the road tax for a year is tens of thousands of yuan. It has four wheels and is driven, so why is it called the LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, you can imagine how fast it is, can't you?
The author doesn't know either, but according to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds for a car to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That means that by the time myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low car body, the noisy scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen through the glass, perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini.
For car models, there's no need to say too much. Just Google it yourself, and the editor has summarized some explanations that Google may not have provided!

It's important to practice getting in and out of cars, otherwise it can be a bit awkward (because you might get stuck halfway out of the car).
The engine is too loud, and after getting out of the car, you will suddenly have tinnitus (although it is still quite refreshing).
The car is too big to stop in a regular parking space. It's very narrow and I'm afraid I'll hit the door of the car next to me when I stop!
I'm feeling a bit lonely because there's no one to race against on the road (I'm talking about myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Please don't misunderstand, the super running in this video is not for sale. I apologize!

According to a special report from Xinhua News Agency in Nanning on May 19, reporters recently learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that starting from the next academic year, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible curriculum, relax the maximum length of college students' vacations, and allow students to extend their vacation time for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years, with the time spent on entrepreneurship considered as practical education time.
To promote the entrepreneurial and innovative abilities of university students, the departments of education and human resources in Guangxi have joined forces to build an entrepreneurship platform. They are constructing more university-based practical teaching bases, science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and incubation bases to provide external support for university students' entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the total area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in each university should reach 3,000 square meters for undergraduate schools and 2,000 square meters for vocational schools.
The government encourages colleges to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes the conversion of outstanding students from other majors to innovation and entrepreneurship majors.
College teachers should have at least two months of internship in the industry every two years to enhance their awareness and ability to promote innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region's Education Department requires all universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the plan for training college students' innovation and entrepreneurship, and strive to ensure that every college student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their college years.
Colleges should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

Thank you to all the staff who took wedding photos today. I look forward to seeing the final product.

A Chinese-American organization has filed a complaint against three prestigious universities in the United States, including Yale, alleging that they discriminate against Asian-American applicants in their admissions process. The complaint was filed with the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights.
Xinhua News Agency Washington D.C. May 23rd (Reporter Xu Jianmei) More than 130 Asian-American groups in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23rd, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the lawsuit.
The chairman of this group, Zhao Yusheng, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top universities basically remains at the same level.
Many studies have shown that in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process of these universities, "long-term continuous discrimination against Asian applicants."
Zhao Yusheng introduced that in 2014, the study by Sanders and other scholars showed that among the top three universities in the United States, the acceptance rate for Asian students was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yusheng told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions.
They also hope that the university can proactively address this issue and change its recruitment policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three schools that have been reported have not made any response.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
In addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the lawsuit, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations involved.

In September 2020, Mr. Liu learned about a factory building located in Yongjia, Zhejiang, China. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Liu decided to purchase the factory building.
In December of the same year, Mr. Liu discussed the details of purchasing the factory with the relatives of the owner of the house, Ms. Lin, and paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan by transferring money through a bank.
Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Building Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the payee, and it was stipulated in the agreement that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the buyer. It was also agreed that the two parties would sign the factory building purchase and sale contract within one week.
However, after both parties failed to reach a consensus on key contract terms such as factory building sales range and payment methods, the house purchase and sale contract was delayed indefinitely.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, several days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu.
It's not easy to find a house that meets your standards, but you've already paid the deposit and are ready to pay the balance. All that's left is to sign the contract, but the seller won't sell. This makes Mr. Liang feel helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Liu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yuyang City People's Court.
The court, after examination, believes that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and that it would be unreasonable to solely blame the defendant. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double return of the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the breach of contract liability for returning the deposit twice.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal.
Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.
【Legal Reminder】 In the trading process, it is necessary to exercise caution and prudence.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, you should fulfill your duty of prudence and carefully verify relevant information, such as confirming the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied, and so on. It is also important to clearly specify the delivery time and location in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.

"日昌外卖" is a Chinese phrase that can be translated to English as "Jiangcheng Ouima." However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact meaning of this phrase.

Rice dish: The menu this time is slightly disappointing.
Three cups of chicken: The amount of side dishes is a bit excessive, and the chicken meat is slightly lacking.
The taste that is mainly adjusted has a slight deviation, the base flavor is not salty enough, which highlights the sweetness, and everyone can think about adding sweetness and various spices to the dish.
What is the drinking method for red label whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people enjoy collecting, some people enjoy food, of course, there are also people who enjoy drinking. Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in all countries, and Red Label whisky has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to taste it, wouldn't it be a waste of its fragrant aroma?
So, how do you drink the red label whiskey?
Here's the translation:  The editor introduces it to everyone in a simple way.
The Chinese text reads:  红牌威士忌喝法：  The English translation is:  How to drink red label whiskey:  Note: "红牌" (hóng piào) means "red label" in Chinese, and "威士忌" (wēi shì jǐ) means "whiskey" in Chinese.
Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch Whisky is made from around 35 different types of Scottish whisky, and has a rich, fruity aroma and traditional Scottish whisky characteristics. The fruity aroma is sweet and smoky, with a hint of vanilla.
The entrance is fragrant and fresh, with a slight aroma of lavender and a rich smoky flavor of burnt rice grains.
This wine can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink.
The red label whiskey has entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the local people, red label whiskey + Coca-Cola, Sprite, or New Castle etc. carbonated beverages have become a fashionable and long-lasting trend.
These sweet drinks not only have the ability to neutralize acidity, but they can also bring visual pleasure and add a refreshing taste to the drink. When added to the drink, they can produce an effect of cooling the mouth and changing the taste.
The most authentic and traditional way to drink whiskey is with a red label, sliced lemon, and sugar (sand sugar can also be used).
The traditional red wine has a slightly sour taste, which can be neutralized by adding sugar. Lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweet-sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three types are the best way to drink red label whiskey. You can try them as a reference, and I hope my introduction can help you.

The English translation of the given Chinese text is:  "Golden Fruit People's Wedding Photography (South Street Store) is currently not planning to open any branches."
Before taking photos, we didn't have a scheduled time because of our busy schedules. We had to change the time twice, but the consultant, Ms. Lily, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to take photos.
The staff of the Golden Family, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, are all highly praised.
That was my first time officially putting on makeup, wow~ It's really hard to believe that I'll look that good one day, haha.
Sunny and another sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) apply makeup very patiently, and the makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Xiangzhou City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel too cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothing and accessories, and if there was anything slightly wrong, they would immediately help us fix it.
The photographer is also very humorous. When he takes pictures all day, he feels very happy.
When taking photos, I didn't want to let the customers take too many photos because I saw many cases on the internet. But when we took the photos, we didn't add any extra photos. We just took the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were extra (I heard that my cousin, who took my wedding dress photos, added more than 1,000 extra photos to her package that cost 7,000, and I was shocked. I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today, I took a photo and sent it to you. I looked at it and thought there were two that weren't very good. They immediately helped me retake the photo.
Compare the photos of my little sister that I took before, and I think our photos are really satisfying, simple and fresh, just like the style I want.
"真心推荐大家去宣汉金夫人拍婚纱照！" can be translated to "I wholeheartedly recommend everyone to go to Xuchang Jin Fu Rentals to take wedding photos!"

Your name is Zhang Ming, and this is your second week in Japan.
You were walking on the street when suddenly someone started following you. You were scared and walked faster and faster until you finally ran away.
The person behind you calls out, "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese dialogue) You stop your feet at the convenience store entrance.
"Miss... I am a director. I think you look very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very suspicious and afraid that this is a scam.
He gave you a business card, and you found out that he was a director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The salary will definitely not be cheap."
You bumped into each other at the company. He said he saw you on the street right away and was very eager for you to join.
You thought there would be no loss, and you could still make money, so you signed the contract.
This is a large-scale romantic reality show, divided into two parts.
In the early stage, we will have celebrities and amateurs interact in real life, cultivating mutual understanding.
"Later, we will enter the game together to explore the dungeon."
Starting next week, the official recording will begin. You don't know who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen, right?
So, can the system see new orders?
So, how would you handle the situation with the drunk driver?
I think I can't accept orders that take more than 20 minutes to arrive.
3200名新生婴儿无报生纸，因特制防伪纸断货。
According to a report from AP, the Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the use of special anti-forgery paper for birth certificates, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, and the number of affected individuals has reached 3,200.
"But the director of the agency, Qi Kairan, promised that all babies who have applied for birth certificates will have their information recorded in the system. When anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week, the missing information will be supplemented."  Note: I couldn't translate the name "凯鲁阿米努斯" as it doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. I used "Qi Kairan" which is a phonetic approximation of the Chinese name.
At a press conference, he addressed the issue of a 10-month-long news report by an online media outlet about the production of paper in Sabah.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and Sarawak was also facing the same problem.
"One of the reasons is that a Chinese factory that produces anti-forgery paper was delayed in delivering to our country due to the impact of the epidemic."
He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, and therefore cannot be borrowed from other states.
Karel Aminu revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up goods, and then return to Sabah to carry out the final stage of printing. It is estimated that the goods will be delivered to the applicant within two days (December 20th).
"We will notify applicants to visit the local branch to collect their admission tickets."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 reports so far this year.
From 7:00 PM to now.
Isn't it about time?
I am referring to food.
I am currently facing #PRS\_ORG# across from me.

Education News: Beijing compressed the ratio of special talents in junior high school entrance examination in 2016 - Xinhua Net
On the 21st and 22nd of each month, the entrance examination for middle school students with special talents in Beijing is unified organized by each district education committee.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of special-needs students in the enrollment, and the competition among special-needs students has become more intense.
For example, in Dongcheng District, the proportion of primary school students who are admitted to junior high school with special talents this year is generally less than 5% of the total number of students admitted to junior high school in the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 people. The enrollment ratio does not exceed 10% of the school's planned enrollment.
All students who have talents in sports, art, and technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the talented student recruitment examination.
To facilitate students' convenience in taking exams, the East City District continues the examination arrangement of last year, setting up 1-2 examination sites in each school, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination will be conducted in accordance with the division of examination centers based on the examination region, and the examination time will be divided into units of one hour. On the examination day, students will enter the examination center according to the examination time and take the examination in different examination centers within the same examination region.
On May 23rd, the district education admission examination center announced the list of students who passed the online examination on their website, and students can query the examination results online.
Can you deliver within 10 to 15 minutes?
I haven't received my food yet.
The key is that I didn't eat dinner tonight.

The President of the Balkan Olympic Committee: Firmly believes that China has the ability to successfully hold the Winter Olympics during a special period - Xinhua Net.
The Xinhua News Agency in Sarajevo reported on December 11 that the president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently stated that the Bosnian side is looking forward to the Winter Olympics in Beijing, and believes that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during this special period.
Recently, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yi Ping, met with the president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic.
When they met, Kaveen expressed his positive evaluation of the relationship between the two sides and said that he had visited China in 2008 during the Beijing Olympics. He was deeply impressed by the excellent organization work of the Chinese side and believed that China had the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics during special times. The Polish side was looking forward to the Winter Olympics in Beijing and the Polish Olympic Committee was actively organizing the event. They hoped to use this opportunity to further expand exchanges and cooperation in the field of sports with the Chinese side.
Jiang Ping indicated that China and the United States have a special "Olympic necklace."
In 1984, the Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here. Two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains, and will present to the world a simple, safe, and spectacular show.
The Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to deepen cooperation in the preparation and training of athletes for winter sports competitions, and to promote cultural exchange between the two countries. The embassy will continue to serve as a bridge between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and will use the opportunity of the Beijing Winter Olympics to further deepen cultural exchange and promote mutual understanding between the two peoples. The embassy also wishes for Bosnian athletes to perform well in the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Before that, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Jian Ping was invited as a special guest to present the award for the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video for the Beijing Winter Olympics is played in a loop at the event site.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控 - 新华网
The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work at the land port cities along the China-Hong Kong and China-Macao borders. It requires that individuals who need to leave the land port cities (excluding those with land ports connected to Hong Kong and Macao) within the next 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test result certificate, and upon arrival in the land port city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the requirements mentioned above is from the date of determining the coastal city range in each province, autonomous region, and municipality and announcing it to the date of March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, coastal cities in the jurisdiction can establish epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their borders.
The National Health and Health Commission introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the frequency of people-to-people exchanges between the two sides is frequent.
Implementing differential control policies, a single line of defense against external spillovers becomes two lines of defense, with the hope of achieving pre-emptive control, compressing the risk of epidemic spillovers, and achieving the maximum epidemic control effect with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, all of which were caused by the importation of the virus through border cities.
The above notice points out that there are some problems with the monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk positions, the formalism of regular nucleic acid testing, the insufficient disinfection of cold chain logistics, the irregular management of centralized isolation areas, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of epidemic emergencies.
The notice requires us to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in the coastal city, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implement border control measures, and focus on nine aspects such as completing the deficiencies in the coastal city's epidemic prevention and control work, doing scientific and precise work, and strengthening the outer defense line.
The notice emphasizes that each coastal city should synchronize the prevention and control of the epidemic with the guarantee of people's livelihood, and conduct research and deployment in parallel. It is necessary to publish and widely disseminate the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, and to regularly check and resolve the hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic necessities. It is also necessary to actively respond to the prominent issues reflected by the public.
According to the notice, the term "口岸城市" refers to open land, water, and air border cities, including the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities), and directly-administered cities where the border is located. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

The true story of the US military's 20-year addiction to bloodshed and violence through oil pipeline videos - Xinhua Net
The video source is from the oil pipeline.
On December 11th, a micro documentary named "Killer Machine" was posted on the oil pipeline platform, attracting widespread attention.
The film tells the story of how the United States, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, launched a war in Afghanistan, and through the war, forced the export of American-style democracy. After 20 years of fighting, the soldiers have become poor, brutal, and bloodthirsty, and have committed countless crimes against humanity.
The abuse of drone strikes on hospitals, schools, and other civilian areas has twisted human nature and led to the formation of murderous groups.
For the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghans.
The US military has set up a "black jail" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation.
The increasing number of anti-human crimes in Afghanistan is arousing more hatred among the Afghans.
As the video says, the "anti-terrorism" war in the United States is "getting worse and more terrifying."
War has not brought peace, democracy, prosperity, and hope to the Afghan people. Instead, it has left the country with gaping wounds and countless acts of destruction and violence.
Watch the video and let's expose the truth behind America's "anti-terrorism" obsession with bloodshed and violence, and pierce through the hypocrisy of American democracy!
The food delivery is late, and the food has cooled down. After it has cooled down, it becomes dry and hard, and there is no way to eat it.

"A few hours ago, there was a confirmed case of a co-pilot."
I am no longer willing to wait.
Don't push people onto the starting line - Xinhua Net
When browsing bookstores, I often feel the explosive popularity of books on success and self-improvement.
Today's successful self-help books often proclaim the "best practices" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do to achieve success.
Translation:  It's equivalent to saying that you have gone beyond the "how to do it" phase, which is actually the most important and fundamental stage.
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done to perfection or they are not done at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb to the top of the mountain, or you simply wait where you are.
This "best principle" allows even those who see it to acknowledge its correctness, but 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates for a "you need to make a firm decision, undergo a 180-degree transformation, and start over" path, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.
For those who adhere to tradition, cling to the past, and resist change, you insist on shouting "you need to transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and ridiculing oneself.
Most people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to take action. They may make a decision impulsively and take the first step boldly, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for long.
The famous "From Tomorrow" song by Mr. Ma Sanli, which is widely regarded as an epitome of the "universal human nature," is a classic that has been widely disseminated.
The biggest problem with the "golden principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "open the door and exclaim in admiration."
Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that more ordinary people can take to achieve relative success.
The core principle of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "striving for small victories", meaning that if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still acceptable: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just reaching the small sandy hill in front of your house is still acceptable, because it's better than staying in the same place.
In summary, just doing something is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in entry thresholds, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one is persistent, the success probability will also increase.
Only by following the "second-best principle" can one achieve success. The path is slightly longer, but it is worth it.
In summary, the "best principle" may sound like it's waving a flag for everyone to succeed, but in reality, it only truly motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" is more effective in motivating and benefiting a larger number of people to the best of their ability.
"Do I need to reorder now?"
The phone is ringing but no one is answering.
The Chinese text "不停延误" can be translated to English as "delaying without stopping."
The Chinese text "还没送到" can be translated to English as "hasn't been sent yet."
May I ask, when will it be delivered?
How can I contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two meals, but there is an order that has been completed.
I would like to ask how to contact the pilot.
The first co-pilot just told me that there should be another co-pilot to send.
The resource reserves of Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,000 tons this year, according to Xinhua News Agency.
According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Yunnan Province on December 11, a journalist from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Qinghai Province learned that the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
The Qinghai Lake carp, also known as the "Tibetan carp", is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed.
In the 20th century, from the 1960s to the 1970s, due to factors such as large-scale killing and overbreeding of fish in the aquatic environment, as well as the deterioration of the aquatic environment, the number of fish in Qinghai Lake has sharply decreased. In 2002, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake fish was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Species Red List listed the naked carp from Qinghai Lake as a near-threatened species.
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any units, collectives, or individuals from fishing for crucian carp in Qinghai Lake and its surrounding areas. The sale of crucian carp and its products is also prohibited.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release of fish and the cleaning of the main inlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages", measures have been continuously strengthened to protect Qinghai Lake. As a result, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased year by year through artificial breeding and release.
The vice director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, nearly 1.8 billion fingerlings of Qinghai Lake carp have been artificially bred and released into the lake, which has contributed more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources.
The Qinghai-Xizang Plateau is a crucial ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the western desert towards the east.
To protect the ecological environment of the Three Gorges region and the Qinghai Lake watershed, and to protect the aquatic wildlife and maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, Qinghai has successively issued notices on the prohibition of fishing in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive "one river, one lake, one river" fishing ban management system.

The restaurant only gave me a bag to put my food in, and it's cold outside.
May I ask, is the food delivered in a bag?
We only see a bag.
Want to know if it was an oversight or if someone took it, thanks.
It has been 1 hour already, and I still haven't sent it.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and sending mistakes is quite disappointing.
To order a separate meal for the little friend to eat.
I hope that in the busy store, you can take a moment to check the quality of the products you are selling.
Is it because the bathtub is leaking electricity?  (Note: This is a play on words in Chinese, where "足浴盆" (bath tub) sounds similar to "泡脚发" (to soak feet and hair), and "漏电" (leak electricity) is a pun on the word "泡" (to soak).)
Choosing the appropriate foot bath basin can have a good therapeutic effect on foot health. Today, the country's small editor will answer this question and hope to be of help to friends.
As people's awareness of healthcare improves, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.
On the relevant data tables, compared to traditional home appliances, health care appliances such as foot baths are selling like hotcakes. However, there is no dedicated industry standard for foot baths, which poses a certain safety risk.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!"
Mr. Li told reporters that he recently bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation on the bottom of his feet.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't realize that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.
Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, it lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was also electrified.
Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.
Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the popular bathtub that has been used for a long time, such as how to set the highest temperature, which group of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, etc.
However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to have electrical problems, but it is also impossible to completely rule out the possibility that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process.
Therefore, when buying a bathtub, choose a semi-integral type.
The Chinese text "水电分离，没有任何安全隐患" translates to "Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards."
You can also take the pen test at any time.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened its doors - Viewpoint Headlines - Hunan Daily Online - Huan Cheng Online
The Hunan Daily reported on December 10 that the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the launch of new Hubei red tea were held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center. The event showcased the tea industry, innovated tea technology, promoted tea culture, and accelerated the goal of becoming a billion-dollar tea industry.
The vice chairman of the National Wholesale and Retail Cooperative Union, Hu Shunli, and the vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hongze in Nanchang has been transformed, and the rising of red tea has injected new vitality into the "Five-Colored Xiang Tea".
In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a trillion-yuan Hunan tea industry, and forming a development framework for "three Xiang four waters and five teas".
Within the tea industry in the province, there is an increase in innovation. The main types of tea, such as green tea, black tea, and red tea, alternate in leading the way. The main tea-producing areas promote the integration of tea tourism, driving a large number of tea farmers to increase their income.
The Chinese text "风水轮流转，红茶又发力" can be translated to English as "The wind and water change, the red tea gains strength."
According to experts in the tea industry within the province, by harvesting both green tea and red tea, as well as black tea, tea farmers can have year-round income, and the output value of tea gardens will continue to rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark, and Xiangzhi enthusiastically celebrated "The Source of Hunan Red Tea".
In the New Hangzhou Tea Museum, Fujian tea merchants fell in love with a high-mountain tea named "Ice in the Spring". They immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea market, but from the tea exhibition, the highlights are everywhere.
The new tea culture in Xinhua has added a touch of red to it, infusing it with the essence of tea culture. People are enthusiastic and trading is hot, and the Cha industry in Xiangzhou is eagerly awaiting the arrival of the new spring.

Member Evaluation
[Effect] Photo effect: Took two sets of clothes, overall it's not bad. I really like this set of pictures.
Service: The details of the service are that during pregnancy, applying makeup can be a bit uncomfortable. The makeup artist and staff are very considerate and let me rest for a while. They also kept bringing me warm water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan.
Thank you for the rabbit's review. Originally, I was going to say that it's not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the final product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us full of energy and continue to move forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend all my little friends to come here!
Regardless of whether it is reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, or post-production, there is no room for compromise.
The makeup artist is particularly skilled, and will tailor your makeup to suit your style. The makeup products used are all from top brands.
Mr. Tan is no longer needed to speak, photography is a profession in itself.
The entire workspace has a very artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little kittens who play around with you.
We are working in Beijing, and all the good movie theaters in Beijing need to be booked in advance by half a year. My colleagues have been to Beijing and watched the movie. They thought it was just so-so.
I specifically searched for this workspace, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression control is not very good, and we think this is a common problem for most people. The photographer, Xiaohong, will take pictures and record the natural beauty of the moment.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, an elegant team.
"When we come out, everyone around us praises us."
I have already recommended my friend to you, and my friend was also very excited after watching the trailer.
Hopefully, such a workspace won't be buried, and more people will discover TA, express their own style, rather than being uniform.
Thank you very much for the five-star review from Cheng Xiong and Qing Ling. Both of them are very creative and have a lot of ideas. We are the creative workshop, and we will do our best with 100% effort and 200% enthusiasm to meet the needs of our customers. We are grateful for the opportunity to meet and work together.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and open-minded photographer teacher, every member of the team is incredibly nice and beautiful. It was an unforgettable shooting experience and the results exceeded my expectations. Thank you all for your hard work. 😘😘
Thank you for the review, Xiao Yu. Meeting you is also a matter of fate. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is like a journey of several thousand kilometers. I am very happy to have met you and hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao again to play.

If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and you need to spend six months to learn.
But if you are planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a very good choice, especially for those who lack self-initiative and need guidance. Training is also a very good choice for them.
If you have relatively strong self-discipline, you can choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important matter.
First, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is best to investigate the institution itself and its students, after all, only the students of the institution know how the institution is and whether the courses are good or not.
Hello, to be honest, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your situation to me. And learning this thing has a very big relationship with one's personal situation.
For example, your profession, age, and desired language of study, as well as the city where you want to study or work, are all related to your field of study or desired industry.
If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is relatively large, and basically requires concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it were me saying these things, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet nowadays, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find them, you can contact me through the introduction and I can provide you with free resources or detailed consultation.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time cost, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teacher's explanation is also very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone specifically assigned to answer them. Moreover, there is also help with learning planning or supervision.
Moreover, many training institutions nowadays will sign employment agreements with students, with a certain number of internal recommendations, and recommend students to go to companies after they finish their studies. This can save a lot of trouble when looking for a job in the future.
Here are some of my thoughts. Since I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction and didn't go into detail. If you have any other questions or would like to consult with me, you can contact me at any time to discuss and communicate.
I said 1 point earlier, I saw it in the App as well.
What is called?
I haven't finished yet, what are you doing?
The following is the translation of the given text from Chinese to English:  "I undertake various tasks such as installation, cleaning, maintenance of boilers, water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil burners, lighting fixtures, professional sewing, housekeeping services."
Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life can be tough, but we have to keep going.
Life will not be burdensome for those who toil diligently. If you enjoy it, please pay attention to me. Thank you to those who silently give me a thumbs up.
Life is like this, others only look at the result, while I alone struggle through the process, facing life, we are not only strong, but we must continue, with no other choice, the road can be turned back to look at but not to return to...

Your concerns are important to us, and we strive to provide the best possible service to our clients. Our goal is to make your life easier by taking care of the details, so you can focus on what matters most to you. We are committed to serving our clients with love and dedication.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  保万家洁净，树家政囗碑，服务到位，洁净到家。
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull and lose their luster if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only after cleaning can they shine brightly. In the same way, life is like a crystal lamp. If we do not take care of it, it will become dull and lifeless. But if we keep it clean and shining, it will be full of light and beauty.
To succeed, one must put their heart into it. To create something exquisite, one must pay attention to every detail. We are meticulous in our work.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for everything, because professionalism deserves to be trusted, your recognition is my greatest encouragement!
The current situation in various industries is not good at all!
"But I always believe that as long as I have a serious attitude, perseverance, and effort, I will be better than others, and at least I won't be sitting around complaining all the time!"
The plan for the day begins at dawn, all the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you bring happiness, good luck, health, and prosperity as you set off, and maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning!
When I was young, happiness was a thing, and having it made me happy; as I grew older, happiness became a goal, and achieving it made me happy; but as I matured, I discovered that happiness was a state of mind, and understanding it made me happy.
To be the most authentic and kind-hearted version of oneself, and to walk in accordance with one's heart, without any regrets in this life; there is only one path in life, and it is to walk one's own path; there are only two treasures in life: a healthy body and a good mood, and to live a beautiful and radiant life until old age.
Every stage of life will encounter different challenges.
Often, the things that constrict you are not your abilities, but your courage to face them head-on.
Since we can't avoid it, let's face it head-on.
The more you are afraid, the more difficult it is to overcome it; if you face the challenges head-on, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The curator of the China-Saudi Arabia joint exhibition held the first edition of the Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennial - Xinhua Net.
The Saudi Arabian contemporary art biennial - the Diriyah Biennial of Contemporary Art - officially opened to the public on December 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art Zone, located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other regions will participate in the exhibition.
This bilingual exhibition is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. The UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing is responsible for the overall artistic direction.
According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this year's exhibition is "Touching the Stones across the River," which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as the current situation of cultural development in Saudi society.
This year's dual-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching the Stones across the River," "Tradition as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Walking towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art."
Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounts for more than four-fifths of the total number of exhibits, covering a variety of forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create using recycled materials, for example, Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: The Endless Mountains and Rivers" (2014) reconstructs a classic landscape painting using discarded objects.
The executive director of the Diriyah Biennial Foundation, Bakli, expressed the hope that this year's biennial exhibition would establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction and exchange.
Tian Wei said: "The goal of the biennial exhibition is double, it can allow Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and also allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to the understanding, there will be a series of lectures during the two-year exhibition cycle, and artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Coordinating and standardizing the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th Telegram (reporter Lin Bixiong) To continuously do well in poverty alleviation and employment assistance for the poor, consolidate and expand the anti-poverty battle achievements, Yunnan Province has recently rolled out policies to promote rural revitalization and public welfare positions, assisting in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources introduced that at present, Yunnan has opened up 44.83 million rural public service positions, which are used to employ rural difficult-to-employ groups such as poverty-stricken laborers, and have played an important role in helping poverty-stricken populations achieve employment growth, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the public service capabilities of rural areas in various aspects.
This new regulation was jointly issued by the Department of Ethnic and Religious Affairs, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and six other departments. It mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public welfare positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of position development, the new regulations are clear, and position development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "as needed, based on positions, dynamic management, and quantity control," "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one job, voluntary disclosure, and unified management."
Recruitment procedures must follow the steps of advertisement, application, review, announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.
The Chinese text "地址错了" translates to "The address is wrong" in English.
Hello! How can I assist you today?
Can you cancel the order?
I have reordered.
Have you canceled it?
Although the rightists have had their moments of glory in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight, and sweat profusely when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they achieve a bit of success, they become arrogant and overbearing, and end up being defeated.
But in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in promoting social progress.
From the definition of truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution to the development of the economy, the improvement of technology, and the promotion of political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing cannot be denied.
Three, in my opinion, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and that it will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. It will also provide an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene.
Fourth, to change or improve China, one must have patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Politicians who seek personal gain at the expense of the country are not rightists, they are opportunists.
Let's talk more about this.
Translation:  Left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of history and politics.  Note: This translation is a direct and literal translation. A more natural and fluent translation could be different depending on the context and purpose of the translation.
If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost this opportunity because the left's goal is exactly what the Communist Party has discarded!
Translation:  Five, I've seen some friends complain about pirated software on the left side of the screen while playing games on the right side, and they still have the nerve to act tough. I think it's ridiculous.
Don't try to reason with traitors and lunatics, it's a waste of time.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't think about making traitors and leftists acknowledge it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the villain insults you for five cents, and when the left-handed person insults you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but as they get older, they forget their ideals or become obsessed with them to the point of fanaticism.
The translation of the given text from Chinese to English is:  "With the pursuit of ideals, one may gradually move further and further away, even to the point where the youth who once sought to slay dragons eventually becomes a dragon themselves."
I generally feel that "left" and "right" refer to constraints and freedom, and that China's overall orientation should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural roots.
The right-wing libertarians in China prioritize efficiency and development, while the left-wingers strengthen regulation and emphasize fairness and safety.
Nowadays, the overall society hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, there is a competition between China and the United States, and the leftist view is generally accepted. It is estimated that this situation will continue for many years to come.
Although I can't understand it, just clicking the like button is enough.
What else is there to say? Flowers are just so righteous.
I'm sorry, but "不等了" is a Chinese phrase that doesn't have a direct translation to English. It is a colloquial expression that can be roughly translated as "It's about time" or "It's high time", but the exact meaning can vary depending on the context in which it is used.
"I placed the order at 19:06, and it's been 2 hours already 😅"
"Today, let's take a look at some [weird] hot searches."
What is a normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2 dragon raises its head, Hua Li friend raises prices, and the commodity pull-up event, the buzz spreads and forms a peak, then [the index drops] (smooth curve) finally dissipates. If a secondary buzz occurs, there will be a small peak again.
They look exactly the same as the network sentiment evolution model displayed on the website of the State Internet Information Office.
What is an abnormal public opinion?
Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a peak, a sawtooth, and a cliff.
The following is the translation of the given text from Chinese to English:  【孤峰状】This refers to the situation where an individual's actions lead to a sudden surge in popularity, resulting in rapid climbing of the hot search rankings and attracting widespread attention.  【锯齿状】This refers to the situation where there is a periodic need for heating, ensuring that the topic stays hot and remains at the top of the hot search rankings.  【断崖状】This refers to the situation where a collective action is taken, and the hot search function is fully utilized to achieve the desired result. The task is then passed on to a new one, and the team moves on to a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the heat wave peak of one event coincides with the trough of another event, with time differences of only a few seconds, which must be the moment when the unified water army received the task and launched a new round of attacks.
The professionalism of black PR can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for publicity, which ones provoke conflicts, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones incite emotions, which ones wrap up decisions, black product accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, almost considering all elements of the spread of public opinion.
Translation:  Public relations is a scientific field, discarding all subjective factors such as personal opinions and emotions, and only relying on objective data. Even black public relations will have nowhere to hide.
All who pass must leave behind traces, such traces, let us dig them out together.
Data source: Time Machine.  Note: "热搜时光机" is a Chinese term that translates to "Time Machine" in English.
Mauritius and other countries have reported the first cases of Omicron variant infection - Xinhua Net
According to a comprehensive report by Xinhua News Agency's foreign correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of the new coronavirus variant Omicron.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on December 10th.
According to the introduction by Mao Zedong, a tourist from South Africa who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th, and a local resident of Mauritius who had contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned, both tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, these two infected individuals had their nucleic acid test results turn to negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence.
The Cyprus Health Department announced on the 10th that the first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus have been confirmed in Cyprus.
These three people are all students. They have just returned from a trip abroad this month. Due to their mild illnesses, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the Chinese government has been increasing its efforts to control the outbreak.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all passengers aged 12 and above who enter China by flight will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival.
The Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 years old in China against the novel coronavirus.
The health minister of Malawi, Khumbize Chipanda, said on the 9th that the country has discovered its first three cases of COVID-19 caused by the Omicron variant.
The health department of this country conducted gene sequencing on 12 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd, and found that these 3 cases were infected.

The Chinese text "收到是金钱肚" can be translated to English as "Money talks."

Do I need to stay in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained everything to them.
Your co-pilot told me the address is too far.

Address: 156 South Ring Road, Happiness Garden Apartment 12th Floor
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
As soon as you enter the store, a series of scams begin.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan. They didn't measure the actual size of the house, yet they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 7 million. They basically gave me a rough idea of their materials without knowing what brand of materials they were.
Their second trick is that as long as you come to the store, you will be dragged to pay the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, you will never be able to get it back, unless you have enough experience and theory with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount.
This is a big hole, and I am an example of being cheated alive. When I had a brainwave, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan.
He gave me a quote with many problems. The price is 7 million without including water and electricity renovation, and it doesn't include any doors or cabinets. The bathroom is also not included in the basic costs.
"Their service points' fees are higher than those of other companies."
I have lost trust in this company. At the beginning, nothing was clearly explained to me before I signed the contract.
When I went to ask them for their money back, they acted like they had a lot of experience and had a special team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it is, it will be a customer's problem, and they are completely innocent.
Various responsibilities and many details, I don't want to say all of them are tears, but in general, don't choose them because my friend found their renovated house to be of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Pitbull, they were the decorative dragon heads that were originally used to deceive people, but now they have been transformed into large and beautiful ones, as if they had collapsed and then changed into something else.
Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing such a shoddy construction company.
In the future, everyone should carefully consider their options when choosing, because renovation is not a small expense.

This is so terrifying, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel if it takes more than 15 minutes.
The chicken should be cooked, but the one I received is raw, and I can't eat it.
Already 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan!
The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card when I pay.
I have to pay for delivery every time now.
Can you exempt me from paying the monthly fee first, and then collect it from me after you have finished your investigation? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery agent?
It's already 3 o'clock.
Isn't it time for me to receive compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to send the goods.
But the taxi driver put it at the door, and then the people left.
The Chinese text "还送错" can be translated to English as "Sorry for the mistake."
Your delivery driver has already picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting.
The rider has received my delivery at 19:25, but still refuses to go out.
After I finish my shopping, do I need to order other takeout?
How to handle the situation?
Where is your co-pilot?
Translation:  Do you still need to wait?
I am here to send a bill.
Alright, if you don't cancel, I'll report it.
"But my food may have safety and hygiene issues."

No problem, remember not to arrange for re-sending, I have already bought it separately, and I don't want to waste it.
Thank you for helping me.
From the past to the present, I have always been opposed to any form of pollution and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior towards individuals.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing you need to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you started sending me friend requests on WeChat, followed by posts with witty comments, and then trying to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have taken a non-responsive attitude towards you.
After you, the frequency of tagging me has increased significantly, not only on Instagram but also on Facebook, where you and your so-called friends continue to discuss some embarrassing and obscure comments about me, such as my appearance, body shape, upbringing, what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed, and whether I should use a condom or not. I... I've also had enough.
How do I know that later on, I received more than one friend's message on WeChat, saying that they had uploaded a photo of you and made inappropriate comments about your sexuality?
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news, you didn't calm down at all, but rather became more and more boastful.
I don't care about your political background or your identity status, in our society, it is necessary to respect both men and women.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of ironic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care and pay attention to me, and you can continue to believe that this is not harassment. In fact, you can even go so far as to deny that it's not a picture you made or continue to publish any attacking statements.
"No, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you."
I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and build don't need your approval.
I don't even think there is a woman who would be willing to humiliate herself like this in exchange for fame.
"Friend asked me, are you still okay?"
I said it, and you won't believe it.
I don't think any girl would be able to say that she's still okay after being treated so cruelly.
Regardless of whether it is in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who have no basic morality will choose to harm any woman in this way.
I believe that justice is in the hearts of the people.
I have cut off some of the comments for everyone to evaluate.
"Your post should not be able to be forged by anyone, right?"
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization.
The Chinese phrase "会心一笑" can be translated to English as "a smile that warms the heart."
I have reported it and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What kind of cow, there is no cow.
It is chicken soup with fresh meat.
"没办法吃" is a Chinese phrase that translates to "can't eat" or "won't eat" in English. It is often used to express that someone is unable or unwilling to eat something.

The 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Manufacturing Talent Summit opened in Changsha, Hunan Province.
The "智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Railway and Equipment Manufacturing Talent Summit opened in Changsha, Hunan Province on December 9th.
The provincial committee's standing committee member and head of the provincial committee's organization department, Wang Cheng, attended the launch ceremony and gave a speech.
Wang Cheng pointed out that holding a talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central Talent Work Conference and the 12th Provincial Party Congress, and it has vividly demonstrated Hunan's commitment to talent, pursuit of talent, and utilization of talent.
Hunan has a long tradition of valuing talent, providing a broad platform for talent development, and creating favorable conditions for realizing a beautiful life. In recent years, it has deeply implemented the strategy of talent-led development, with the Fuyuan Talent Action Plan serving as the driving force. It has built a comprehensive talent work grid that spans the entire talent development chain, becoming a fertile land for talent growth, a hotbed for innovation and entrepreneurship, and a pleasant place to live and work.
Currently, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "three highs and four new" strategic positioning and mission task, and will further open the door to talents, provide more preferential policies, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, hoping that outstanding talents from all walks of life will join forces to help Hunan achieve high-quality development.
The following text has been translated from Chinese to English:  The activity was set up at the Changsha, Zhuzhou, Hunan Exhibition Center and the Hunan Free Trade Pilot Zone Exhibition Center. The Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security released the list of advanced manufacturing-related industrial technological innovation needs, the intelligent manufacturing industry talent demand catalog, and the postdoctoral mobile station intelligent manufacturing industry youth talent demand catalog.
Forty-eight large enterprises in China, including China National Railway, China Communications Construction Company, and Wanda Group, have recently launched a talent recruitment campaign, attracting nearly a thousand graduates and social talents to participate in the talent project matching.

This house has a relatively complete set of home appliances, with a wide range of brands and many well-known brands.
On the twelfth day of the twelfth lunar month, I went to the "Hansdon" water purifier store to see the water purifier. The store was having an activity and the prices were quite reasonable.
There are a total of 11 floors in the parking lot, from the second basement to the ninth basement. Both the second basement and the first basement are parking areas, and parking is free during the day!
The surrounding area is not very impressive, with few restaurants and shops. The food in the restaurants is also average in taste.
This elevator is also very quiet, just like someone who is sick, going down two floors to one floor, twisting and turning, never stopping at my floor, from the emergency exit to the first floor, it's also very quiet, straight to a furniture store, the furniture store is closed, and I can't get out of the emergency exit!
It turns out that the house still needs to be improved, and there are many places that have not been developed.
Address: No. 555, North 1 Road, Shaibak District, High-speed Railway Station, convenient transportation, with a large parking lot, and parking is free during the day.
Environment: The store is spacious, with 8-9 floors. You can buy everything you need for your home, such as furniture, electrical appliances, and various small items, all under one roof. Many well-known brands have set up shop in the store, including MUJI, Adidas, H&M, IKEA, Zara, Levi's, Uniqlo, GAP, Victoria's Secret, Nike, Puma, and many more. The number of brands is truly overwhelming, and I can only remember a few of them. It's a great place to shop for products, and if you get tired, you can take a break on the sofa.
Recently, I have been thinking about buying a comfortable sofa, and my friend told me that there are many sofas to choose from here. I looked at the sofas on the websites of Home Deco and IKEA, and I felt that they were okay, but the prices were slightly higher. So I am still hesitating.
Provide the latest merchant information such as high-speed rail "real home" address, phone number, business hours, etc. on the Urumqi home sales channel to help you find a decoration company.

The Yangtze River's mainstream has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua Net.
Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11th Telegram (reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing City Yuzhong Water上绿色综合服务区10日如期建成投入运营，这是继8日四川省泸州水上绿色综合服务区挂牌运营后，长江上游正式运营的第2个水上绿色综合服务区。
"Until now, the water上绿色综合服务区 has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River."
The Ministry of Transport and the Yangtze River Administration Bureau's deputy director, Qi Jianhua, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been well received by the majority of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The comprehensive green service area covering the waters of the Yangtze River is another milestone event in the green voyage construction of the Yangtze River, which marks the improvement of the reception of pollutants from ships on the Yangtze River and the significant enhancement of navigation services.
According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service center is designed to provide comprehensive production and living services for large ships and crew, and is an important facility to help the crew solve the "urgent and difficult problems" they face.
This is the translation from Chinese to English:  The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this time, integrate life services, production services, and public services into one body, with green environmental protection as the main theme, and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as their special features. They aim to provide "one-stop docking and multiple services" for ships in the port, making the work of sailors who regularly sail on the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient.
I've been waiting for you for a long time now.  (Note: The above translation is a direct and literal translation. A more natural and fluent translation could be different depending on the context and tone of the conversation.)

The joint exercise "Peaceful Relief-2021" between the armed forces of China and Vietnam has been successfully concluded.
Xinhua, Hefei, December 12th, 2021  On the morning of December 12th, all members of the Chinese participating team in the "Peaceful Relief-2021" joint exercise between the Chinese and Vietnamese armies safely returned to China's Guangxi border region, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
This joint performance focused on the topic of humanitarian medical rescue, with both Chinese and Vietnamese troops tightly adhering to the mission of guarding and rescuing the wounded, and completing joint command, on-site rescue, and mass treatment of casualties in accordance with practical standards. This effectively enhanced the capabilities of both armies in providing emergency medical support.
The exercise results have been recognized by both the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries.
The chairman of the rehearsal guidance committee and the deputy chief of the logistics department of the Vietnamese People's Army, Nguyen Xuan Phong, said at the conclusion of the rehearsal that through this rehearsal, Vietnamese military doctors have learned about the organization and professional activities from Chinese military doctors, as well as recognized the medical and protective equipment of the Chinese side.
The results of the exercises demonstrate the professional capabilities of the military medical forces of both countries in the fields of medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
The Chinese guidance and coordination team leader, Central Military Commission Logistics Support Department sanitation sub-branch deputy branch leader Chen Chunming, said that this exercise was another innovative practice based on the successful joint triage activity held in 2018, with significant milestone significance.
During the training period, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid detection instruments to the Vietnamese People's Army for health and epidemic prevention purposes.
