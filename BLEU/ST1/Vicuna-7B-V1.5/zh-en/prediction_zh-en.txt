现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。

ASSISTANT: Today's successful self-help books often proclaim the "best practices" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do to achieve success.

It's equivalent to saying that you have gone beyond the "how to do it" phase, which is actually the most important and fundamental stage.

正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。

ASSISTANT: Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done to perfection or they are not done at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb to the top of the mountain, or you simply wait where you are.

这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。

ASSISTANT: This "best principle" allows even those who see it to acknowledge its correctness, but 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。

ASSISTANT: Because this theory advocates for a "you need to make a firm decision, undergo a 180-degree transformation, and start over" path, which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people.

对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。

ASSISTANT: Most people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to take action. They may make a decision impulsively and take the first step boldly, but it often doesn't last long and they can't sustain it for long.

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。

ASSISTANT: The biggest problem with the "golden principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, making most people "open the door and exclaim in admiration."
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。

ASSISTANT: Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that more ordinary people can take to achieve relative success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。

ASSISTANT: The core principle of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "striving for small victories", meaning that if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still acceptable: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just reaching the small sandy hill in front of your house is still acceptable, because it's better than staying in the same place.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。

ASSISTANT: In summary, just doing something is always better than doing nothing.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。

ASSISTANT: Due to the significant reduction in entry thresholds, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one is persistent, the success probability will also increase.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。

ASSISTANT: Only by following the "second-best principle" can one achieve success. The path is slightly longer, but it is worth it.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: In summary, the "best principle" may sound like it's waving a flag for everyone to succeed, but in reality, it only truly motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" is more effective in motivating and benefiting a larger number of people to the best of their ability.

ASSISTANT: If you are a student and have not yet graduated, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。

ASSISTANT: Although the rightists have had their moments of glory in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they get a little bit of sunlight, and sweat profusely when they drink a little bit of water. As soon as they achieve a bit of success, they become arrogant and overbearing, and end up being defeated.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

ASSISTANT: But in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in promoting social progress.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。

ASSISTANT: But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and that it will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. It will also provide an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene.

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。
