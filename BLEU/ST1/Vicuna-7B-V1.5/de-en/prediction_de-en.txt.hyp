The product cost less than 20 euros.
The fee is 40% of the goods value...
I am a large customer of #PRS\_ORG# and therefore it is not a problem for me.
Please provide just a number or instruction on how to address the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying to be honest.
Must I cancel the order and reorder for a better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I believe that it is generally not appropriate to expect children to take on a parenting role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for big brothers and sisters to take care of the little ones to some extent.
Translation:  Just a quick look, just a quick help, just bring the bottle, etc.
So learn responsibility, help in the family and are involved.
As long as they are still able to take care of themselves, I don't see any problem.
If your K1 spends time alone and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best estimate whether it is suitable for your children.
It's not that he should be able to spin K2 and accompany you while you fall asleep for hours.
It is legally questionable.
Perhaps the statement of the psychologist is also true.
"For if something were to actually happen, such as a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2."
Whether or not it is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book!
I remember reading a crime / thriller novel a few years ago, and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, the title eludes me completely. Maybe someone here knows something about it...
The story was about fear and how to overcome it.
At the beginning of the story, an animal caretaker commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going to his predatory cats in the enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets in touch with the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety disorders.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and lands at this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the location of each suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet.
At least, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where the patient is implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately confront their fears in the most extreme way possible.
(a woman jumps out of the window, another one kills herself intentionally)
The concept of facing one's fears is referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had a fire.
The basic plot I am quite sure that the book was written by a French author / authoress.
If this story is known to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN available.
Must first contact my husband.
But it can take a while.
What steps should I take afterward?
Is it also possible to receive a refund for the price difference?
Child, 4 years old, splitter under the thumb nail
Child, four years old, has splinters of wood under the fingernail (outside) throughout its length.
Have tried to pull him with a pinzette.
Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and caused pain.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to approach it.
No chance left.
Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

Due to Omikron: Johnson plans to accelerate the booster vaccination
"New Omikron cases are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK."
Therefore, all eligible adults in England should receive a vaccination offer by New Year's Eve.
London - The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to speed up the COVID-19 booster vaccinations due to rapidly increasing Omikron numbers.
Adults in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening.
The target date was previously set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the Scottish, Welsh, and Northern Irish regions.
"We are facing an emergency with the Omikron variant, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, said Johnson."
The good news is that the protective level could be increased again with a third vaccination dose.
"Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, it was an increase of a whopping 65%. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns.
I have sent in an application.
Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email.
I want to reply to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have googled him/her and depending on where they have a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now.
Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I do not want to step on the toes of any officials.
Conclusion: Everyone should be familiar with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on it.
4 of them go.
Only one thing that I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect when it was sold.
How can such a pillow damage occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS\_ORG#.
It works already since about.
"14 Tagen nicht mehr" translates to "Not anymore after 14 days" in English.
Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 more.
However, there was none left.
Now they are available again and I would like to ask if you could add two chairs to the order and bill me for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in detail here.
I must simply write something from my soul.
I (21) frequently come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims cannot or do not want to help themselves, or we could think that we cannot help them.
I am quite clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are things in my profession that move me more than when I am unable to do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, perhaps it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even very close to tears, is that everyone is worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they do not have to simply endure violence.
Often, I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
"But it will never be easier."
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends"?
A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing design: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Disaster of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim.
At least Johannes Patrick, a youngster, was left behind.
Nothing again: For the second time within not even three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomach."
After the game, she did not lay down - but rather became even more agitated, given the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga.
Whereas more than just the naked result, the way of appearance disappointed.
A substitute statistic is named, which expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quote amounted to just 13 percent, 4 goals (all scored by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any more questions?
The answer provided by John Patrick was: "We were not concentrated enough after our victory at Tenerife, and we did not implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, moving the ball.
Sebastian Gleim's counterpart reacted quite differently: "A great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like being in front of 10,000 people."
"There were only 750 visitors allowed at the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they came at their own expense."
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led his team's play.
"The best player I have ever trained", praised Gleim.
While Patrick's team, including performance leaders such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed throughout the line.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points.
Fortunately, there is still plenty of time to haggle.
Already on Wednesday (7:00 PM), the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg before then.
We had earlier a different email address, but I have changed it.
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore contacted them again.
We originally reported ourselves already half a year ago.
Always as neatly peeled as an egg: Max Raabe turns 59.
He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform.
Actually, Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "due to official instructions" to curb the spread of the COVID-19 virus.
Other planned appearances by him during the Advent season must also be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (<http://www.palast-orchester.de>).
Starting in January, the artists will try to catch up on the concerts that were postponed due to the pandemic in 2020.
Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and happily since he was a young boy.
In Berlin studied he Operngesang, 1986 founded he together with Kommilitonen the Palast Orchester.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer thinkable from the current German-speaking music landscape.
With the program "Good day, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture, so we could control whether it fits in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only sew the cover, but I can't turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new federal minister of construction, Clara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large residential property companies, as it has been demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
According to Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday), "with expropriation, no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure."
My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix, such as private landlords, cooperatives, or housing corporations, is actually the best protection against monopolistic tendencies.
In Berlin will the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party set up an expert commission to deal with the consequences of the people's vote.
But if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz just concluded talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will speak with the justice minister to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market does not improve, "we will discuss further steps with our coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I noticed a few days later that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or will it come again at all?
#PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
"Gutschein klingt super" translates to "Discount sounds great" in English.
Then I solve the independent variable in the new order.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut myself on the finger.
This is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes were drawn through the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be attributed.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
On the night before Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the United States and may have claimed up to 100 lives.
The storms leave behind an approximately 320-kilometer long trail of destruction, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees.
It is difficult to imagine that it is possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official numbers increase hourly.
Hello, I have just seen that Vitrine #NAME# is out of stock.
That is very unfortunate.
Will it still be produced?
Or is she completely out of stock?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when will you report?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return, and I would like to inquire if it has been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans.
While the German government is rejecting proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees cash bonuses for getting vaccinated.
In order to be on a line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, which today demanded financial incentives for vaccination.
The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is intended to increase willingness to receive Corona vaccinations.
He has changed companies over which he has complained.
That doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It has been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old place and was looking for something else.
You can also do that.
And that he didn't find you well at that time: naja, it doesn't matter.
He didn't even find his job good.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation on.
That would then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.
Good day - I am interested in the Boone White Table.
Is it also available in a size of 230cm in Germany?
We carry all Smeg kitchen appliances and accessories in our online shop kitchenpoint.de.
We generally check the quality and completeness of your order.

Thanks to the steam plant, even coffee and milk foam specialties can be prepared.
Help with first own campaign  (Note: "Kampagne" in this context refers to a marketing or advertising campaign.)
"Boron zum Grusse!" is a German phrase that translates to "Boron greetings!" in English. It is a play on words, with "Boron" sounding similar to "Bonjour" (French for "hello"), and "Grusse" being a German word for "greetings" or "salutations."
I am currently guiding a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Dragon's Pass" and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been thought out, and now I am here, writing the introductory adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter.
The premise is that the heroes must transport a wagon full of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further development of the plot will take place there.
Some miles from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the hero and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the ability to solve the confrontation in various ways: to convince, to act, to threaten, to recognize the danger early on, which also falls to the players.
Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabres armed.
Unbeknownst to him, the goblins lie in wait for the hero in a narrow path and flank him with three on the left and three on the right, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the carriage.
If the fight comes and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be unconscious and subsequently found by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf, and healed.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his knights and helps the heroes in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is the Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter too much of an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a crucial role later on and is not just cannon fodder.
"Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not so many great suggestions and tips."
I will definitely consider many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And again, stuck together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to send it back.
Can you then let the return labels come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

Suddenly, the crack was there.
I am simply sitting on it.
Here was the lower part, so to speak, the part with storage space damaged.
Will everything be collected again or only the storage space part?
I am annoyed by Sky Sport F1.
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on the German Sky has steadily decreased, so I'm taking a moment to vent in this post.
Firstly, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to ensure punctual coverage of the F1 reportage.
Although the schedule was significantly behind due to the delayed start and the crash at the beginning, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision.
It seems that, for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice here.
Despite being dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race until the end.
Despite a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well.
Then there was again a lack of regulation knowledge among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change the tires under a red flag in F1.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both parties only came to the decision that Verstappen could change his tires after receiving relevant radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was a possibility for Verstappen.
I believe one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 at a pay-TV channel.
It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, I don't like the artificial comment style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste.
But seriously, even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better than that.
In addition, there are constant jokes that both sound unprofessional, such as ordering coffee by the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
The last one brings total chaos to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over on Sky. In the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear in the German commentary-free sound after the race on F1TV.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two senders also make less advertising in their training than Sky, and that as a free TV sender.
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the drawbacks.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very scarce and full of repetitions.
Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-speaking broadcaster for Formula 1.
Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast, excluding advertising.
At least, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For here: #PRS\_ORG#-pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and has not been delivered yet.
I have contacted the chat twice and nothing has happened yet.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, and she has never replied.
Hello, I have ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I request support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium.
It is also possible to operate a filtration system through air ducts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Please look at the end of the offer in the table.
There you can see the services in comparison.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate entire facilities?
If you have a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that multiple outflows can be connected.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model, but a fan pump is also available to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with an air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar to name.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction, which ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very easy.
The fan pump is connected to an exhaust duct using an air hose with a diameter of 4/6 mm...and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
The deeper the fan pump sits, the higher the water level should be, and a check valve should be placed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and place the ventilator in between.
This would prevent water from flowing backward, which would cause the water in the basin to flow through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, just like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate the processing time on eBay with 3 days, packages are packed daily and picked up daily as well.
Everything is running smoothly while I'm on the go, it's going very fast.
We just want to take a quick look so that no one gets upset, just because it took a bit longer than usual.
It would be like that, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in logistics... of course, here Corona doesn't stop either.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services.
Of course, people naturally complain about these services, even though we're saying right now...they've got it pretty tough.
This is also regionally very different.
Be kind to no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times ahead.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Can you also order the legs in a bright color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator to space
The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers embarked on a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately 10-minute flight took place in the western part of the U.S. state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly decorated astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were on their way for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard (1923-1998), who was launched as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and for whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminisced about the mission of her father after the short flight.
He had to work hard and make everything himself during his missions.
She was simply along for the ride, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
"He would like to return to space as soon as possible," said the moderator.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies mostly automatically.
The capsule detached from the rocket during flight reached an altitude of approximately 100 kilometers above the Earth, at times experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned flight by Blue Origin: At the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became famous worldwide with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without considering the climate.
By pressing the "Knopfdruck" button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in one color or display its entire color palette.
When subjected to color changes, the light stone maintains a light color for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp protects itself all year round in the open air.
In a snowy environment, their light shines particularly well - only with shortened light duration should be counted when the days are shorter.
Please pay attention in the winter that no snow affects the function of the solar module.
"Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the current Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.
You can order a suitable replacement battery through our webshop and thus extend the usage time of your Dekoleuchte.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry.
I am currently studying in my first semester of biochemistry and I find the subject itself quite interesting. Additionally, being in the laboratory does not bother me (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical course).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at the same time, I also thought that I would definitely continue studying until I graduate.
Currently, I am experiencing doubts, particularly concerning my career prospects, which are quite disheartening.
On one side (Studycheck etc.), one hears constantly about great job opportunities and the profession being highly sought after, while on the other side, one hears constantly about unemployed biologists and extremely poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would be truly interested:  (Note: The translation is a direct and literal translation. A more natural and fluent translation could be different depending on the context and purpose of the translation.)
What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What have you studied/which training have you received?
Would you like me to translate the entire text from German to English?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and am considering whether to break off my studies in 2022 and become a trainee IT specialist.
If you have any experiences to share, please feel free to write about them :)
Extra stress before holiday and festive weekends.
This topic came up last week with me.
I must now use my long weekend to relax.
Therefore, now is the time for a post.
Not only before major holidays, such as Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our operation.
It seems that there are also plus days before holidays and bridge days.
Well, it was like this: Last week was the feast day of Mary's Ascension, which we call "Ascension" here in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend in the house.
What happened last week?
Stress is everywhere.
Urgent emails that needed to be sorted out before takeoff, assignments here and there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Why... yes, why?
"Why 'next week then' sounds so much and it shouldn't be that way?"
Or is it because people want to accomplish as much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also extremely agitated.
What is the purpose of this self-imposed isolation during holidays?
Why do we still have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent and on top of it.
My question is simple: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical style?
Or do you know it in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia.
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't even bought any gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
You will agree to the party by baking cookies and pastries with your son.
"Ich liebe das" is a German phrase that translates to "I love that" in English.
"Until the enlightened days, I still had a lot to do: 'For the first time, I still haven't received any gifts, I have to get rid of it now'."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moulting and feather regeneration.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of Biotin per kilogram.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather.
The majority of feather defects occurring in bird keeping are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless feather coat.
For a functional metabolism, the daily diet should contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
When composing NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be administered easily through drinking water or through the soft food.
Thank you, I have found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part of it.
The central beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them.
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are produced incorrectly.
The central bar does not fit into the intended holder.
I also receive new ones.
When will they be sent?
No, there are no flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones in terms of size, they were only too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
For me, they are not flat.
Could I receive this?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and significant damage.
Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, a estimated damage in the six-digit Euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke poisoning.
The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The Criminal Police (Kripo) in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
The translation of the text from German to English is:  "It comes then much later"

To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo.
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin has not publicly expressed his vaccination status so far.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has moved him to share, said Şahin.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there were false information that I allegedly was not vaccinated.
"Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"For the past few months, my friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around him.
But a call in the past week has changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe COVID-19 infection and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks.
According to Shahin, the school friend and his family have not been vaccinated.
He did not ask for reasons.
"However, the most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the internet, an interview with Deutsche Welle is circulating in which Uğur Şahin says that he has not been vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated.
"I am currently not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself," Sahin said at the time.
There is a prioritization in Germany for vaccination against COVID-19.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been suspended for a long time - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in Transformer: Thousands of people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the light went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases probably also no heating.
A fire had disabled an electrical substation.
After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, thousands of people in the Rhine-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without power for around 24 hours.
Through the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents in several communities.
The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation until the widespread disturbance could be completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered places in schools for supervision and called for neighborhood help.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are very conscious of the fact that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring efforts, said Florian Witt, head of the primary technology department, in a message on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damages will still take some days, as the Western network technicians could only temporarily put some cables back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company statements.
Electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 19:15 has reportedly caused significant damage to parts of the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid, according to Westnetz.
There would be extensive cleaning and repair work required.
"Parallel to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created."
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is again.
Since Saturday 6:00 PM, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 PM.
Since 23:15 Uhr, even the last ones affected by the power outage have had power.
Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies have been in operation.
The authorities had called for neighborhood assistance after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now for citizens to take care of older or lonely people in their neighborhood and to inform the local fire departments when help is needed," explained Sebastian Schuster, the district administrator (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or needed electrically dependent medical equipment or were dependent on medical care. According to government authorities.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy them and pay in euros?
It is about the daily newspaper #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the substructure on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of it.
We wanted to use table plates with a diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today, my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I cannot collapse it and thus shorten it.
Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are otherwise not suitable for the purpose.
I would appreciate a feedback.
"Yes, that is really easier!"
Then we'll do it that way!
Can you send me the return shipping label via email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG#.
Should I do this now?
I find it almost disrespectful to offer such a low discount.
We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic combined: Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup event in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a significant lead after the ski jumping event.
Return of the order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we have both made s new and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem before.
I have directly bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it as well.
When I try to open it, the message comes up, "ups!"
This document could not be opened.
The file may be faulty and should be reported to the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
"Chat connection is gone and now what?"
I have to work in between!
To ensure that the color application is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soapy water, clear water, and dry them thoroughly.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color to the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the parts or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the building component.
Draw the pencil evenly stroke by stroke.
The overlapping of the color layers later results in a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back-and-forth brushing with the brush.
Due to this, unrealistic-looking areas are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metall tones and metallic colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal streaks may occur when they mix with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve their original appearance through decals or removable images.
From national symbols on aircraft to ship names, decals, and license plates on automobiles: Decals give the model the final polish.
Please bring the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible.
A plane's cockpit can be easier to clean before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpick, when gluing are time, patience, and a steady hand.
Cut each required decal individually and arrange them as needed.
Decals are also known as water slide decals, because you wet the back of them with water until the carrier paper becomes dark.
Then you just need to draw the picture a little bit on the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check if the image is positioned correctly before you completely tear it off the paper, so that it does not stick to your finger, knit or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention not suitable for children under 3 years
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Can I receive this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages with me.
Thank you very much!
Then I will buy it somewhere else as soon as the money is back.
Can I get it back problem-free?
Childbirth treatment with PKV / What is a "Versicherungsfall"?
Hello everyone,
We were some time in children's wish fulfillment, now when it comes to billing with the health insurance company, it suddenly stands in the way.
According to the series:  번역결과   시리즈에 따라:
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and received the promise of up to 3 attempts.
The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. in terms of time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was credited to the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and underwent 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but we did not yet include the PKV in the calculation.
We requested again the cost coverage by the PKV and were granted again 3 more attempts.
After some further attempts (we have conducted more attempts than promised, logically the most expensive ones should be covered by the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to cover 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first promise fall away.
The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when treatment need no longer be required."
The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right to claim the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)?
* Should the PKV have pointed out to us that with a birth, the further attempts fall away?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
Infertility (due to closed fallopian tubes) cannot be cured by having a child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Okay.
We will no longer place orders with them.
If they add up the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They can certainly pass this along to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated and now you are telling me that I need to send the thing back first.
I can certainly not be held responsible if the wardrobe is completely disrupted when it arrives at my place.
Please see the screenshot of what the colleague has written.
It is clear and distinct that the repayment was initiated and I have not yet received a repayment per #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore.
No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell him as a desk chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to obtain a different type of packaging.
I will dismantle the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG#.
These products are advertised with additional hockers that we can unfortunately not find with you.
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget movies
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:  Please provide the text you would like me to translate from German to English.
A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what might not appeal to you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended again, is this now also reliable?
Thank you very much.
With friendly greetings,  (Note: "Mit freundlichen Grüßen" is a German phrase that translates to "With friendly greetings" in English.)
Is there no phone number, a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will give up soon because it simply doesn't work here.
Hello
A "Halber Sieg" against Belarus is associated with high costs for the EU.
The EU can, according to political expert Raphael Bossong, declare a "half-victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
"But the costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania," Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
The EU has not resolved the confrontation sustainably, according to a researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of suspension - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, according to Bossong.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Because the EU as a whole has not decided against it, it will come at the expense of basic rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union at the same time.
"She seems unable to prevail when a member state insists on doing its own thing, as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border protection agency, access to its borders."
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic consensus on asylum policy would be impaired, as the slogan "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Renewed attempt at crossing the border
According to reports from Poland's Border Guard, migrants have attempted to cross into Polish territory from Belarus again.
55 migrants were arrested in the night on Sunday and taken back to the border, according to a spokesperson for the authorities on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly attacked by migrants near the village of Czeremsza with stones.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months, or attempted to do so.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko of being a dictator in Minsk, luring him with the prospect of visa-free travel to the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have erected border barriers.
The EU imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure.
The most effective element of the EU response, according to Bossong, is the pressure on the airlines.
"The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination, with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions to operate."
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly passes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has protested after the controversial Formula 1 finale.
Max Verstappen is alleged to have committed two rule violations during the race, according to Mercedes.
After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal.
The silver arrows suspect two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally.
A second objection was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-compliant manner.
Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and celebrated his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, in which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I am testing it.
I am speaking with the bank and reporting myself to you again.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is organizing SC Freiburg Fantag.
The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and permanent card holders of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were coupons for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains were lit up with red and white lights on this day.
"Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park."
Already since the early 90s, there has been a collaboration between the Bundesliga club and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it has again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Shining fans can be seen having fun together on the roller coaster, and that confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

Judith Hermann read from her novel "At Home"
As part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series, author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also served as a moderator.
She is divorced, lives by the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for the return of an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be, has my request been initiated?
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not all from our household.
Contacted Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We talked yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# will receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return shipping label.
This email has not yet come.
The package wants to be delivered to #PRS\_ORG# today.
Please contact me.

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite does not mean anything.
This is like when a politician says he has nothing against immigrants.
Both of you will not be able to deny it.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces some anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it be completely.
"Wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah."
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution on a fundamental level is simply lost.
According to my belief, a God has set everything in motion.
But once you become a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense.
And with that, you are a science enemy and not to be taken seriously like a colleague.
To achieve an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye.
The specifically planar-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the loupe practically without distortion and color errors even in the edge zone.
Often, lenses are marked with magnification values.
These statements apply only to precisely defined conditions that rarely correspond to the usage conditions.
To make the most of your magnifying glass, please note the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (See instruction manual in the packaging).
On the surfaces of all optical devices - including lens inserts - light reflections occur.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced.
When using the lenses under optimal conditions - with the loupe almost touching the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are searching for Christmas trees.
Frank Diers, a farmer from the countryside, has experienced many curious situations while selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even had to drive home without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year, he plants about 2000 pieces for that.
"There, the 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations."
"That makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit funny, he says."
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, I'll be gone as a customer?!
At least, I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name.
In English, an equivalent might be something like "the spinner," which doesn't sound nearly as appetizing.
Problems with fiber optic cable + Devolo DLAN/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am currently having problems building a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which, with a few exceptions, flawlessly received and transmitted 50 Mbit.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receives these.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends WiFi, the full 500 does not come anymore, but the further I get away from the module in the house, the less comes in (so use a power strip that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet is now even slower with the new fiber-optic connection on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was certainly better than DLan, but here too there were similarly large losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optic cable?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely time-consuming to rewire the LAN cables in the house.
I am truly desperate, which is why I have created an extra account here.
Therefore, I would be much happier with an answer.
When it's time to switch your current account  (Note: This is a direct translation of the German text. A more natural English translation would be "It's time to switch your current account" or "It's time to consider switching your current account".)
Who would have thought that now there would be peace at the Giro accounts, but it is deceived.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past with various tricks from their customers, the negative interest rates also continue to fall.
For example, the German bank had a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time, which was considered relatively generous.
Now she has halved the free bet and even quadrupled the daily stake.
In a first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division of Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower tax rates apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers."
The Commerzbank has already gone below a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as well as at ING Deutschland.
The currently popular direct bank DKB has reduced the interest-free periods in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now a grace period of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached a limit of 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have even been granted legal rights in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Banks are currently discussing whether institutes should create reserves - in case the upper instances declare negative interest rates in principle as unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.

Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army.
You are now officially at the top of Hollywood.
"But your life is like a mountain and valley journey."
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers is concerned with their appearance.
"At least, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a single chip from the bag)."
That the hearts of both male and female fans still beat equally is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still searching for the great love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It was truly hurtful.
Stay hopeful that success and fame will bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire
Kimi Räikkönen's departure from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That was it.
After a driving error and a minor tire contact, Kimi Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after only a few laps due to a technical issue.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the Motorsport royal class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Raikkonen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 while driving a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I have calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he deflected Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, in which he moved from rank three to one.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove on Sunday with 0.30 seconds to a larger lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he defeated the British Brad Hall.
Third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving from Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after finishing second in the previous race.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed on eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, then I would also do it that way," said Lochner.
Nolte wins at home - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte won her third seasonal victory in the two-man bob at home.
After finishing in fourth place in the monobob on the previous day, she raced to a World Cup victory with her pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday.
The two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
You booked alongside your Olympic qualification, your first podium finish in this winter.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed in third place with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was super cool to get the first podium spot in the World Cup. I am super happy that Mariama is joining me.
I am very happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the starting line, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized, "It's not just about pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not entirely error-free trips, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay it, so I finally asked about it.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that he was expired, which made me very angry.
Look at the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently reduced :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th?
There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was was gestern von Ihrer Kollegin abgenommen.
Why is it a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered item.
But we still want the shelf module, even a new, undamaged one.
And not the entire order can be canceled.
Only today, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear girls and women,  I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to remind you all to be kind to one another. In these times, it can be easy to get caught up in our own struggles and forget about the struggles of others. But remember, we are all in this together. We all have our own battles to fight and our own demons to overcome. But by lifting each other up and being there for one another, we can make it through anything.  So let's continue to support and uplift one another. Let's be a source of kindness and compassion in the world. And let's never forget that we are all in this together.  With love and admiration,  [Your Name]
I have something I would like to write and perhaps it will resonate with someone - or maybe not.
I am 24 years old, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - except that my dog doesn't cry or goes to kindergarten, he is basically 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, has a second-degree burn on Monday and is depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel that we have a lot of cuddling and it was beautiful.
I helped him with his shower (because my hand is in a band due to a burn).
He is also cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) which makes it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My dog has just had an upset stomach, so I cooked for him and now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and petting him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have to do some homework, which we of course divide between us.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) is currently well-established, and I am halfway through my therapy. I am coming along nicely.
Not good, but I'm getting there and I'm almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (in German). Tomorrow at 3 pm, I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow, there's an anatomy lecture for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left there.
Also geht meine Woche so: Nur noch bis übermorgen, dann ist Wochenende.
But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am just so stressed that I need these mental anchors, otherwise I pack it in.
Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't seem to do it any other way...
Is it going well for you too?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
Truly infinite gratitude, I can't even express it in words.
I'm not sure if I would have survived otherwise.
I believe that this also has something to do with the mental load of women, and therefore I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole thing is a different color plus surface is scratched and there is a table leg impression.
At the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, will I get another color or something?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26, #NUMBER#.
In English, the text "Im übrigen zwei mal" means "In addition, twice."
Confirmation was not given.
It was completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is for them just another subject like math or geography.
For me, it has always been somewhat strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something.
How do you stand on it?
Maybe you can also tell stories from your work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional matters and it is reasonable to separate them.
Sure, here's the translation:  "Also, there is also a curriculum and such."
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity.
What makes someone want to learn about religion if they don't believe in it?
Do you want to preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write in English, I understand it well.
That's already very long, then I would prefer to avoid it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
"Filmsuche Hilfe bitte" translates to "Help me find a movie."
Hello dear people,  I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for all the support and love you have shown me over the years. Your kindness and generosity have meant the world to me, and I don't know where I would be without you.  I hope you are all staying safe and healthy during these uncertain times. Please take care of yourselves and each other, and know that you are always in my thoughts and prayers.  With love and appreciation,  [Your Name]
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I believe it is a film for young people.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds).
First, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Since I cannot describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to that of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths cross and a story emerges.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Reich of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can continue to live, in my opinion.
I believe the transition is also the burial site of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers will fight against each other.
If this says anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept only on their stomach from Week 1.
"Fast forward: still alive :D"
Relax.
"So ein Kind hält viel mehr aus als man denkt." translates to "A child holds much more than one thinks."
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly toys, often go in and look, but no minute surveillance.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
"Achso and ours had no sleeping bag, but always a blanket."
Watch your child when it sleeps.
Is your head turned to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly button?
Or is it with the face down Directly on the mattress?
You can derive from it whether everything is in order.
We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was still common to put children to sleep by laying them on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already "Stammkunde" (regular customer) with you and have already purchased many articles.
But why are you offering me only 20 EUR?
Hello, I have already contacted a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The drawer is currently not usable.
To make it quite clear.  (Note: This is a direct translation of the German phrase "Um es mal ganz klar zu sagen." It does not capture the nuance of the original phrase, which can be interpreted in different ways depending on the context.)
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself, not everything can be held.
And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
"It's just the way it is, the politics of this sender is now under everyone's sauce."
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then still going on a big begging tour.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Arno's quote: "One doesn't want to be a 'running litfass column'."
What is one now?
A 0815 advertiser trying to sell his merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts.
The following text is in German:  Die natürlich für jeden gelten, außer Simon und Etienne.  And the English translation is:  Naturally, these apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people.
A Krogmann who lacks empathy completely and tries to make ashes with exploded rented rooms at the cost of action.
How should one find all of this good?
"Toll if you like, I find it terrifying."
Please call me back, as my delivered wooden table is defective.

Whether as a comfort during abdominal pain or simply for cuddling - My little warm friend is versatile and can be used in many ways.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for pleasant warmth applications, as cherry kernels absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft touch makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the children feel secure, even when it doesn't go so well for them.
The cranberry pillow with elastic edge is suitable as a warm cushion for the following application areas:
Before the heating of kisses on untypical odor, stock or brand stains, check and dispose of them immediately upon their presence.
Please take the inner cushion out of the package before heating it up!
In the microwave at maximum power of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (manufacturer's specifications should be observed!)
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it!
After that, lay the inner cushion back into the cover.
At the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Please adhere to the given heating recommendations, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Check if it is allowed to heat corn products in the microwave according to the manufacturer's instructions before heating in the microwave.
After the warm inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion on suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) at your elbow joint!
Do not use the pillow in case of acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood ecchymoses, and open wounds, as well as in case of individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
Please consult a doctor before use if you have existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes, or tumor diseases and are pregnant.
If seams have opened up and kernels have come loose, discard the product and the loose kernels immediately and make them inaccessible to children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the baby during application should be regularly controlled to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority in the country where the user is located.
The connection is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after the first half - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 may dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone.
It's not going well for Ingolstadt under the third coach either.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, happiness in Hannover over interim trainer Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and approximately 3 years old) would no longer charge through my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought a power cord alone was sufficient for operation.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even with the AC adapter plugged in.
After that, I took out the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Do you have any ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the internet?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# brought into the room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
"Oft auf Tour und trotzdem viel Ausrüstung dabei?" can be translated to "Are you often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment?"
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, there is no problem!
The 20-liter capacity can also accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the polished FlexFold dividers.
And what you might still need for everyday objects is well organized and separable from the photo equipment, thanks to practical approaches in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The minimalist design has it all - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
It works with two options: conventionally through the lid, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in Messenger bags.
There is a metal locking hook inside the closure flap of the backpack, with appropriate anchor bars on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are actually 4 reinforced anchor points, into which the locking hook can be inserted.
If the backpack is fully loaded, simply take the top bar. If it is relatively empty, take a deeper one.
Additionally, the "Klappenverschluss" and "Haken" are also magnetic.
So can the backpack be closed reliably without using the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other camera backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday usability of the backpack enormously: If you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more details below) and easily separate both compartments from each other - and access them independently through the two side openings as well.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards the body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right compartment, while the everyday items stay safely in the left compartment and don't get in the way.
Comfortable and easily adjustable harnesses help.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's raining in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# has sent me an email as confirmation of the assignment.

Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment were made on January 12, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend my coupon, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture item and not returned it.
And I couldn't have guessed that the past year would turn out differently than I initially thought, and I wasn't able to properly address and clarify it in a timely manner.
But the damage as a customer, I do not accept.
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to appreciate reliability and safety when braking, even under difficult conditions.
Rotating brake discs are manufactured by casting and then mechanically machined (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain discs and patterns.
Based on the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created that focuses on enlarging the disc according to the properties of the original assembly.
The tuned discs ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, where the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and calipers.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks at the southern branch of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were delimited, tents were erected, and saloons and hotels almost emerged overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the west and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win.
You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridge plates, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma played for a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection is revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a monopoly!
This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving carts, setting up tents, exploring rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters.
When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The pricing strategy turns at the beginning of each round to a new location and changes the available actions as a result.
This goes on until the speculator has moved five times, so that each location has been covered once and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where the players have to defend Coloma from a group of angry bandits.
If the players have enough revolver heroes and the bandits are numerically superior, the players will receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the graveyard.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins!

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW: Psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse.
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately.
The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest on talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now raising serious accusations against him.
Please bear with me, the film is difficult to watch.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It should never, never, never be allowed for parents and other responsible adults to have power over a child.
Our goal should always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the given situation.
Translation:  Ugh, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries are discussing the removal of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We need clarity quickly from the countries whether and when the testing obligation can fall for three times vaccinated people," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to the "Bild am Sonntag".
The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated individuals is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive to get vaccinated," said Holetschek.

How should I proceed there best?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I can no longer complete any purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#.
Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# page on the computer goes.
I have updated the contact details.
What could this be about?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, so sensory perceptions under full anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing sounds/voices, less commonly seeing images, and rarely feeling pain.
Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia up to the time of delivery in order to protect the child.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia methods, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes Awareness correctly, however, u/Nitemarex had none by definition.
I have misread her comment.
The chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ are not enough to help us.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation, it is also a standard in the eCommerce area.
Please check if you can at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately.
We also lose some money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to.
One more question.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The freight forwarder is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
A man told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If yes, I must cancel the order because I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.
"Will I not be called?"
I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history.
On Friday, Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older."
The shattering diary of a slow farewell from the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my gratitude for life."
There are different types of palettes.
One of the most common types are European pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as a load carrier in the European region.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from the Austrian Federal Statistical Office, over ten million palettes were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was approximately 79 million euros.
How many palettes are imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

I received many great tips for the perfect goulash here a week ago.
There was something special at Christmas, and it was incredibly delicious and creamy!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow I will set up a beef fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now?
What about the books, and how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can still manage.
The text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made.
But so far, the money has not arrived with me.
Please check there.
Where there is still Christmas bratwurst in the Lübeck area  Note: Bratwurst is a type of sausage that is traditionally eaten during the Christmas season in Germany.
For many people, geese or swans are an integral part of the Christmas season, just like the Christmas tree and gifts.
Have you not yet purchased any poultry?
The time is running out.
We reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controllers, you can set both the desired level and the distortion of your sounds.
Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL controller that allows you to reduce the sound level without changing anything on the "Gain" and distortion.
Above that, it was already audible that one can even make a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator, when it gets unreasonably loud.
Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulators, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The signal being processed here is a box simulation, which means that you will get an "acoustic" sound impression even if you use headphones or take direct recordings.
To the AUX port, a CD or MP3 player can be connected so that you can jam to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate pitch adjustment device.
If you want to spend extra money on a VFS5 foot switch, you can call the sounds comfortably by foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects "tap".
For the live application, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!

Also, ich würde sie gerne zurückschicken.
Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe?
Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a legacy or gift certificate.
Under certain circumstances, I can find a buyer for the furniture.
Only €1,000 for goods that I don't need would be too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws are included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# Spiegel (Tür) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it.

Iran is making progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement.
At the negotiations on the revival of the international nuclear agreement, progress is reported according to Iranian statements.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be discussed on the agenda," said Ali Bagheri, the chief negotiator of Iran, to the news agency IRNA on Sunday.
This is a "positive and important development," because at first there was no agreement even on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks aimed at reviving the agreement were continued after a brief interruption of almost a week.
At the negotiations, representatives of Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia participate.
A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has surpassed Saxony - the free state is now the Bundesland with the highest Corona incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence rate in the country.
As the only federal state, the value lies above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia has exceeded the Corona incidence rate of 1,000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported the seven-day value with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which last showed the highest incidence rate nationwide, the value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly decreased, but it also exceeded the value of 1000.
In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill COVID-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Additionally, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery is not expected until early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the post office, that's it or?
Here, I don't need to click/enter/fill anything?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you.
I would like to request that the return be sent at my own expense.
The 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, a rudeness.
It's time for changes.
Welcome to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here?
When one looks at the activity in the past months of the MBundestags, one can conclude: it does not exist.
We have come to a winter frost and have extended the summer hole for some months.
Where is the problem located?
Yes, what was the reason?
For the most part, it probably has to do with dissatisfaction, how things have gone here and how we generally feel.
In the last few days, it has become increasingly clear that many people here are still very excited about the upcoming MBundestag.
#What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSISTant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir ändern müssen  ASSistant: #What we need to change  #Was wir
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is being asked whether they want to keep it alive.
The spark came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of broken pieces.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community have found each other who are interested in rebuilding the project.
However, I would also like to expressly invite everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can access the server through this link.
Goals:  * Ziel 1: Verbesserung der körperlichen Fitness * Ziel 2: Stärkung des Immunsystems * Ziel 3: Gewichtsmanagement * Ziel 4: Verbesserung der psychischen Gesundheit * Ziel 5: Erhöhung der Energie und Vitalität  Methods:  * Methode 1: Regelmäßige körperliche Aktivität * Methode 2: Gesunde Ernährung * Methode 3: Mindfulness-Übungen * Methode 4: Schlafmanagement * Methode 5: Stressbewältigung  Results:  * Ergebnis 1: Verbesserung der körperlichen Fitness * Ergebnis 2: Stärkung des Immunsystems * Ergebnis 3: Gewichtsmanagement * Ergebnis 4: Verbesserung der psychischen Gesundheit * Ergebnis 5: Erhöhung der Energie und Vitalität
* How should the Bundestag function in the future?
What existing orders need to be changed / adapted / removed?
* How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited?
How can we create a fair voting system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten something, which is not too bad, we have the Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together, and let's democratically decide on the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered.
Now I see that the article is too large/clumsy for my taste and not suitable for my needs.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed it then, when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the daily planner #PRS\_ORG# also come in a larger size, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS\_ORG# should be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be collected promptly.
And I ask you to please make it happen now.
I do not have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the shelf as far as possible for pickup - they must clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how that can work.
#PRS\_ORG# can contact me by phone at any time to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for the assembly?
How long would I have had to take care of this or make a decision about returning it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I enjoy.
You yourself have lived vegetarian for a while, and you currently eat meat very rarely.
I myself was previously a vegetarian for several years.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And so, I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
In that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction had arisen on their side. They then defended vegetarianism and said that they knew where their meat came from and that as vegetarians, they could reduce animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was appropriate?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without one wanting it.
It greets a harmony-loving vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an exception under § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am at the assigned date and time when #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return beforehand.
Since I cannot be present at the location due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Can you please assign me an alternative pickup time?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr is prepared for water rescue: 45,000 euros subsidy from the state.
Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a funding decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new device car of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte at the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle that has been in operation since November 2020 was 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
"I'm glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein.
The device van is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks both on and under water in water and ice rescue as well as in technical assistance.
In Lahnstein is permanently associated with increasing deployments: The boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I have followed her recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work.
I am somewhat frustrated because the whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I now hope for help.
Okay, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive, furthermore, I do not want to go into it!
I always find the question of right and left oversimplified.
Generally, one should say that naturally, the civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It is clear to everyone that people who are dressed in special uniforms and carrying weapons are naturally attractive to those on the right who are conservative and magical. However, it is also clear that these people can have a hard time dealing with everyday reality. Of course, you also have many Germans with migrant backgrounds, women, and homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated stereotypical gay men, there are hardly any of them in the executive, but rather normal men and women who don't advertise it if they don't tell you). And I must rely on these people, because in the worst case, they can save your life or set something up for you.
But even these peripheral groups also represent, according to my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less abused by excessive left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly fights for them or means to do them justice, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, of course, the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, and one will also find extreme right-wing views there, although they are not allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-threatening plans. This is medically completely exaggerated and also annoys me.
Of course, it can happen that even police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, start to generalize and say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect due to negative experiences.
It also happens that certain right-wing ideological comrades meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well fought against in my opinion, and with political education and enlightenment, the whole thing is countered!
Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is also good in my opinion, that we could hardly afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I have already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I have previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket also available somewhere in Germany.
I always find you as a partner company.
But there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part that are filled with something yellow.
And on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Is it possible to translate the following text from German to English?  "Ordentlicher durch Kind?"  The phrase "Ordentlicher durch Kind?" can be translated to "Ordinary through child?" in English. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the intended meaning of this phrase.
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a thing for a longer time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but throughout my life, I have had more trouble than I would like to keep my household clean and organized permanently.
There are always phases in which everything stays where it is, and sometimes it catches me and I tidy up and clean.
"But it is actually never so that someone could spontaneously drop by."
My husband is (unfortunately) not better either. It bothers me somewhere, but mostly he just loses the household against work and laziness.
The kitchen is regularly cleaned because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become orderly with your child?
We have none yet, but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for a longer time.
Because for me, I have no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as much as it used to, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide a greater incentive or does one remain lazy?
I am looking forward to your responses.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-end, as well as anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and thus enables almost unrestricted freedom of movement.
Pre-shaping with specific, further molding at the joints for improved range of motion (in bending of arms and knees)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further enhance comfort.
Continuous stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-formations in the lower back area and in the step ensure a snug, perfect fit.
The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar spine area increases flexibility around the back closure and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Continuous, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face near the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate head cover).
Translation:  "Soft, the zone located in the collar improves sealing with a fine-adjustable spacing by a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the masking or the stitches."
Double cuffs with a zipper closure at the arm and foot joints connect an adjustable inner cuff with a soft, quilted neoprene outer cuff.
45° Injection at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when pulling.
A long zipper at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort overall without a hat.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hat) with metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent)
Zip fasteners at arms and legs  (Note: "Reißverschlüsse" is a German word that translates to "zip fasteners" in English.)
Reinforcements of neoprene at all ends of the latches to prevent tearing when excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of the outer cuffs trimmed for greater load-bearing capacity.
Edges of the inner cuffs embroidered for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
"Career in social work - as someone with a self-unconfident personality disorder?"
I have completed an apprenticeship in the field of software development and have been working as a software developer for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting over and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a self-doubting (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
That roughly means that I have no self-worth and as a result, I am shy.
I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told multiple times that I come across as unapproachable (which I believe has improved somewhat).
Can I become a social worker?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it is difficult to find something about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems for me in my job (for me, emotionally) because it always pulls me down when there is something to criticize in my code ("again, the simplest things are messed up") and it is difficult for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do it by now"/"he's holding me back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm underqualified" etc.).
I will likely have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
Have you already received the sofa?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by "Please return!" in English?
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book" does not appear.
Is there a problem?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein contained in the food is broken down by the bird into its individual amino acids in the digestive tract. These amino acids are then used by the bird to build its own body proteins, which are also required for feather formation.
The feather formation in nestling birds and the feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it may cause disruptions in the breeding process.
After this brief gift of NEKTON-Bio, it should again be switched to daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 gram NEKTON-Bio per 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A dotted teaspoon (inclusive) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
For severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as a desk chair.
How can a desk chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
This is truly very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged when it arrived and pictures were attached.
Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,  번역결과   안녕하세요 r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree will be felled.
Also, a request was made to the community.
An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the bylaws.
But in the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree.
Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the statutes are clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received any message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you then offer me a legacy or a gift voucher?
What were more expensive?
Yes, I believe that's correct. The only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the deed delivered to Germany.
Can you check?
Emergency Report: Serious Traffic Accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the exit Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As currently reported by the police press alarm (14:03 Uhr), a car came onto the wrong side of the road while overtaking.
There are injured people.
Okay, I understand.
Great, then thank you again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life
First of all, happy Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about.
Before I start ranting here and now, let me summarize: I need advice, and the best advice comes from people who somehow understand my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently working on the Ref as a newcomer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (at least somewhat anonymously, I won't mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun.
Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that it was what I wanted to do - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I Google other job postings" stage.
And it has only been half a year.
At the paintings before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, then I can always turn around.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Although it is currently vacation time, there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday was my holiday.
I had the freedom.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally irritate me.
Generally, it's fun and from an external perspective, the ref also runs well, in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already done so.
I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had the freedom to take time off when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, it was appropriately compensated and I accomplished something as part of a team rather than as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back at the same place next year and be just as unfulfilled as I am now.
You notice that everything is somehow chaotic, but perhaps as outsiders, you have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation where I am completely finished and practically start crying at the mere thought of it.
I will not make any decisions now as I am feeling very emotional, which is likely to lead to nothing good.
"But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now."
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
Also, diese Amps enthalten natürlich auch den mehrstufigen Valvetronix-Röhrenvorverstärker.
This partly relies on genuine analog circuits because these capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation.
Additionally to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them to be.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for.
All guitarists dream of the power and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube-like character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lose to the Clippers.
The Orlando Magic's losing streak in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also highly adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable Velcro closure components, it is tailored entirely to the needs of your photography equipment and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-frame DSLRs.
What ultimately fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible setup could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
Additionally, one can also store a lot of accessories.
And who has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and for non-photographic items.
Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro drone including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is there an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, with 84 days.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano on the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make any predictions as to when it might end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE.
"Schäden in Millionenhöhe" translates to "damages in millions of euros" in English.
In the three months since the eruption began, more than 1,000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
That is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land masses were formed by solidified lava with a total area of approximately 50 hectares.
The banana cultivation on the island, which is of immense importance to the approximately 85,000 inhabitants and on which about half of them directly or indirectly rely, was severely affected by the volcanic eruption. The cultivation was already in crisis before the eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and additional areas were severely affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children will hardly be able to wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive quality combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
It is all the more important to become conscious of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "society contract of natural peoples" that brought about peace, can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life within the context of this tradition.
How Nicholas became the Christ Child  (Note: "Christkind" is a German term for the Christ Child, who is the central figure of the Christmas story in the Christian tradition.)
Strictly speaking, it were the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with the giving of gifts.
Previously, on St. Nicholas' Day, gifts were exchanged in one form or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women at night, in order to spare them a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving gifts, the popular custom in Germany of filling children's boots with presents emerged.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of mediators between God and humans as "holy worship."
For these reasons, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only annoys the fewest people that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas season.
Today you can find everything one's heart desires in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, from socks to coveted luxury watches.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful confusion about the question of who will bring gifts to the children now.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is an Santa Claus-like figure, to whom some unique characteristics have been assigned over time.
Examples include his white beard, which has little in common with the more strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought considerable fame.
Here it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

Police shot a suspected bank robber near the Royal Palace.
Near the Kensington Palace in London, a heavily armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police announced that callers had reported a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookmaker's business.
The man fled according to official statements in a vehicle that was later stopped by police.
There were shots fired and the man was hit.
He was still at the crime scene when he was declared dead.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
There are several messages located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The Palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Additional members of the royal family also live there.
Which one?
No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your site.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area, or stone garden.
The lamp can be simply placed and can be anchored with two earth spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum brightness duration of 10 hours.
The robust plastic delivery is usable all year round in the outdoor area.
In the Hollywood spectacle, it is mostly ominous objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with vibrant colors.
However, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones).
The smooth, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic shapes fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass or in the stone garden.
He also makes himself useful in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries.
"Set the 'Leuchtstein' at any desired, sun-illuminated place."
Two included earth spikes provide a secure hold when needed.
The white plastic hull itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides a "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colorful light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
"Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically as twilight sets in; in which color, that's up to you: You have six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to white for daylight.
Also, das Abschalten erfolgt automatisch, sobald der Akku-Ladestand auf ein vorgegebenes Minimum gesunken ist oder es wieder hell wird.
As soon as the sun comes out again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I have already done it several times, it doesn't work.
Sorry, I would have liked to continue ordering from you, but if the coupon is not credited to me, then I will not order from you anymore out of principle.

During the lockdown, of course, no hardware store has opened...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been further fundamentally improved.
A variable, adjustable PWM frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super-quiet operation with bell crank motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A motor current, which is sufficient even for older motors.

Pillenproblem  (Note: "Pillenproblem" is a German word that translates to "pill problem" in English.)
Hello dear womenfolk,  (Note: "Weibsvolk" is a German term that translates to "womenfolk" or "women's community" in English.)
I hope I'm doing everything right, it's actually my first post after a year.
To my problem: I have been forced to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible cramps during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stay, because I already have to take enough medication that I cannot choose for myself due to chronic illnesses.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pains, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100, I suddenly got explosive acne all over my body.
As superficial as it may seem, it has really bothered me and I did not feel well.
In the two years of pause, nothing has really normalized.
Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this this time.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without any dyes, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the female doctor did not take me seriously and I still have to go to the dermatologist's appointment.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the love of the skin is such a thing.
Had terrible neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread plaque psoriasis and acne as a topic.
I have also tried various types of food during my Christian illness, including sugar, milk, and meat-free mixtures, as nothing else seemed to work properly.
It can also be good that hormonally it's just the worm inside, but if you want to have construction everywhere like me, you'd better not look for it anymore, otherwise it might run the wrong way.
I had already seen all of her colleague's seminars o. ä.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I must work continuously and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to test if the money were there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
"But is there generally in large?"
"Because it is available in black in large format."

In the name of the people: laymen pass judgement
In the dining hall, they sit in everyday clothes on the judge's bench.
"But their judgment depends a lot on it, even if they don't wear a robe: lay judges decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes behind bars."
Two of them report in a conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht at John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice for order number #NUMBER# to the email address above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We do not have the ability to store this for so long.
We would use the table as if it were offered to us, as if it were ours.
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the translation:  "Gerne, habe bereits im November den selben Sessel in Blau bestellt und auch erhalten. Daher, weil die so schön sind jetzt, einen in Grau."
Must the shelf be completely disassembled for pickup and return?

An 110-kV underground cable will be built in 2022.
The permission for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria makes the way for the construction to begin in the year 2022.
The network operator Bayernwerk has now shared this information.
The approximately 7-kilometer long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning near Reut.
Good morning!
My order from January 3, 2021 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part at our company.
The blue delivery number #PRS\_ORG# with the order number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is now?
Have a great start to the week!
You can forget about it, I have already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass commode, and all the sides are inflated, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken.
The wardrobe stands in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
It means that the wardrobe cannot be taken away because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message.
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request was made at #PRS\_ORG#, as it probably involves a general problem.

I have been working at the Ref since summer, and I enjoy teaching, but I currently have big problems with time management when it comes to planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the schoolbook, and an OHP as media.
In school, I can only copy in black and white for free (which can be nerve-wracking for geography).
I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I also don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually, I create an worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore, also the work sheets.
Maybe a geography teacher can give me some tips on how to work efficiently with the book.
"Würde mich echt freuen" is a German phrase that translates to "Would really please me" in English.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to process the return as quickly as possible first.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation around Christmas.
In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 are allowed.
The trade considers it unnecessary and regrets sales declines.
He also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations according to the Handelsverband Deutschland (HDE) harm the important Christmas trade for retailers.
At businesses dealing with articles of non-daily needs, complaints about sales declines should be made, criticized HDE Hauptgeschäftsführer Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was actually supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often just an empty hole without any ground," said Genth.
Retailers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's going well only in the food retail trade and in the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G when shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel deployment.
The bandage regulation should be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer should only be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and should have access to all businesses with the band they received on that day.
Furthermore, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - spot checks should be sufficient.
Even the real estate company specialized in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona levels, and the revenues at approximately 90%.
"These numbers will now fall securely in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approvals obtained for the centers.
The so-called "bracelet solution" is mentioned, where "visitors, for example, have to present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to those in a club hotel - can enter all shops unrestricted." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#.
The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also an error at the frame that was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
The English translation of "Das sieht unschön aus" is "It looks ugly."
I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the package and taped it shut.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance construction, based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color rendering.
For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is used.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitively operable.
The lamp generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance is excellent.
By the way, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with, either on the film set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery scope).
User storage The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the preferences of individual settings on the storage devices, simply press and hold one of the storage keys for a longer period of time and it will be completed.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when new devices are turned on, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for operation with affordable NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have sufficient performance before setting - it is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in both display indicators (left battery compartment upper indicator, right battery compartment lower indicator).
In addition, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power through the included power supply.
The construction of the spotlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm thread for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using adjustment screws on both sides.
It was important that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and, as a result, are designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a knee joint is included in the delivery.
Great, the delivery also includes a bag.
So can you transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems?
Sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, die wir schmeißen wollten": Frankfurt feiert nach torreichem Comeback gegen Leverkusen  Translation:  "Party, that we wanted to throw away": Frankfurt celebrates after a torrid comeback against Leverkusen.
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times they failed to score in a row, the Hesse team seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga fiasco.
But then the SGE turned around, shot its frustration over a mediocre season start within an hour and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have achieved today," coach Oliver Glasner celebrated at DAZN and gave a "general compliment to everyone who was there."
At first, it looked like another damper was needed for the Frankfurt, which was still behind its expectations despite being ranked ninth.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in the lead with 2:0.
What then happened, even impressed the SGE trainer.
"As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am absolutely delighted with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Even defensive player Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game due to his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, beaming with excitement as he looked at the result, particularly for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he sees himself in a good position regarding the personnel situation.
It is exceptional that all players are fit in December and that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally.
Now one wants to "take steps forward and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level."
The next game in the English week is already scheduled for Wednesday, as part of the away match against Borussia Mönchengladbach (8:30 PM, Sky).
I will receive the mail that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part.
I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is resubmitted?
For me, it would be unfortunate if it meant that I wouldn't order anymore because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Silencer for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain.
Germany's women's handball team slunk off the court with hanging heads and empty stares after their humiliating defeat against Denmark.
At the end of the WM main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against the host country Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," concluded national coach Henk Groener.
We must act differently against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second-placed team behind Denmark (10:0).
It's unfortunate that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"This was a bad game that we have to get rid of," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, there must be a significant improvement on the coming Tuesday against the 2019 World Cup runner-up to keep the delicate dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive.
Dear German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and called for action: "We must now quickly look ahead."
From the front to the back, not on the same level
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at its best at the start of the game.
Mistakes and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only firefighter Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job temperature and prevented worse with some parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels completed a quick counterattack successfully.
The expected ignition did not occur.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an appearance - and when they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game ended prematurely at 3:10 after 20 minutes, due to a hard foul by Mia Zschocke on her opponent, resulting in a red card for Zschocke.
In the quarterfinals, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection start to play better, and by the break, they had at least scored five goals.
The already quiet hope for a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes in the 9:19.
The Green-trained shooters again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent who counts among the medal candidates at the final round.
In the following text, the German team was unable to perform at a higher level and left the court as the clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season  Translation:  DACH-Adventskalender Tag 6: Familientraditionen in der Weihnachtszeit  DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season
In the context of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have captured St. Nicholas Day and use it as an opportunity to dedicate family traditions during the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it then at home with you?
How about your partner's?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children?
What is the most beautiful thing for children?
The translation of "Das Stiefelputzen" from German to English is "shoe cleaning."
"Plätzchenbacken?" is a German phrase that translates to "Are you baking cookies?" in English.
"Baumschmücken?" is a German question that translates to "Are you decorating the trees?" in English.
Do you play music?
Will Santa Claus come, the Christ child or is the gift from Oma and Opa?
No matter how you do it, everyone gives themselves and around Christmas tries to make it as beautiful as possible to have a family.
Is it now a fixed tradition, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number, or otherwise, what could help?
Translation:  Overpayment confirmation... etc.
I would like to give a discount code away.
As with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers.
Is it going well with them?
The title already exists, I am a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since they will be completed soon, some of them will go to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally oriented (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination...").
In my area of responsibility is the information about the vaccination, the indication (the person has a claim to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and possibly the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, for example, medical assistants.
In vaccination teams, we often do not have pharmaceutical technicians but only "nur" (for God's sake, no missing appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot perform vaccinations (should not?), so that I also perform the majority of vaccinations there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberg knows the solution.
What please is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, intense thinking has been aroused in the BR television show "We in Bavaria".
But unlike on many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous".
And also no one, "who everything has to go quickly."
The people heard from the TV moderator that it was completely wrong.
What the man from Amberg told and probably also caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate people.
"The sweeper", the audience learned, "is a rag used to wipe the oven."
Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed it.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar Mundart word "Houdern".
What a gap in education was closed - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for two weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: "oops - something went wrong - try again later."
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# service, newly started, connected to the PC, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing has helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - is it really that safe?
Today, tomorrow, I am eagerly awaiting the opportunity to ride my bike, as I want to at least a little bit train for my upcoming cycling tour next week.
Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really beautiful - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glassplitter on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the journey on no account.
Since I couldn't really buy a replacement jacket and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home.
Was war dann auch launentechnisch nicht ganz so schlimm, vielleicht ist es ja auch besser, wenn ich nochmal vor der Radtour das mit dem Reifenwechsel übe.
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would very much prefer not to have this problem repeatedly.
Now it was really not that bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had driven until 14:12 on the day I picked up the bike) were still there, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years.
"But when I think that I still need to change the tires after 80-90 km of driving, then I'm pretty sure I'm in a bad mood:D"
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the railway platform, who surprised me by asking why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbeatable.
Now it sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible?
I don't want to spend 40€/Reifen right now, only to be disappointed later.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
There is also (apparently?) at the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Would you generally recommend tires to me for a racing bike?
The Swallow's side seems to be my absolute! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD to me?
Thank you already in advance for the help and loving greetings!

Hello to all,  번역결과   안녕하세요 모든 사람들.
Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which means that it requires a higher planning effort and explains the short-term announcement.
"ABER: There will be at least three people per switch, so we will be able to stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow us!"
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
"But hey, it's still a pandemic – we'll still give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible."
It will be approximately 0:30.
Make yourself some drinks, plan good food, and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
