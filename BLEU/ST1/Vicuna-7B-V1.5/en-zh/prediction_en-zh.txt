Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again

Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

ASSISTANT: 在第四天的全球广播中，Gabba测试的主要和备用发电机约25分钟出现故障。

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.

USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.
