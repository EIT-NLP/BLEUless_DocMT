A very meaningful certificate - First Aid Certificate
This is one of the important skill certificates in addition to the driver's license that I think is valuable!
Please disseminate the following information: First aid measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken in the event of sudden accidents, that is, emergency treatment before the arrival of the ambulance.
As is well known, after an accident occurs, it takes some time for the ambulance to arrive. In fact, it is this period of time that is the most critical.
This is the time that requires emergency treatment.
If I were to really experience a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life would only be four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So the people around you understand first aid is so important!
When someone falls nearby, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there doing nothing, feeling helpless, which is a terrifying feeling.
In China, we have official data of three hundred thousand people dying from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is heart attack.
In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%.
This is what the founder of the first reaction, Lu Le, said.
If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing, their heartbeat stops, and performing CPR on them would be ineffective.
It is necessary to perform manual ventilation and chest compression to have a chance to save the person's life.
I have found that few people currently have the awareness to learn first aid, but when an emergency arises, it may be too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations.
It's possible that it could save a person's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students.
PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before turning 25. Adding the first aid certificate to the goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certifications that I'm interested in. I'm planning to take a scuba diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a scuba diving first aid certification. It seems like you need to have a first aid certification to take the scuba diving certification, so actually, the first aid certification is quite useful!

Chongqing vocational school pilot modern apprenticeship system, enter the school is an enterprise pre-employment - Xinhua Net  (Note: The translation is in simplified Chinese characters.)
Yesterday, a reporter learned from the Municipal Education Commission that starting this year, our city will pilot "modern apprenticeship" talent cultivation mode in 60 secondary vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will have both student and apprentice identities. After enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The municipal education committee requires that the recruitment and employment procedures for vocational schools be standardized, clarifying the dual identity of students in vocational schools and employees in enterprises, and adopting a mutual selection principle. Students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement, and for students who have not reached the age of 18, a four-party agreement must be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific position, curriculum, and benefit guarantees for the student's on-the-job training.
Encourage pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship system format and jointly conduct on-the-job training and transfer training for enterprise employees with collaborative enterprises.
The pilot school plans to reform the talent cultivation mode.
Jointly design talent cultivation plans with enterprises, and jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Please translate the following text from Chinese to English.  Use the internship period as a pilot phase, and determine the internship duration for students in enterprises according to the talent cultivation plan. The elite internship usually lasts for 6 months.
In enterprise practice, the enterprise cell management mode should be implemented. According to the characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotational position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 municipal intermediate vocational student modern apprenticeship pilot sites in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot site, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained.
According to the principle of piloting first and then rolling out, gradually advancing from points to areas, we explore the establishment of long-term mechanisms for joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation between schools and enterprises, in order to effectively improve students' job skills, increase their employment rate and improve the quality of employment.
My App shows as delivered, but I haven't received it yet.

This vacuum cleaner was considered for a long time, and finally I took the plunge. The suction is quite good, and there is a noticeable reduction in dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand, and the wet mop needs improvement as it leaves dust trails when removing and attaching. Overall, I am still quite satisfied.
The cooking machine is quite heavy, looking up at it, it's suitable for a beginner like me in the kitchen. My child said that it tastes better than what I cooked. I have made two dishes with it, oyster and vegetable stir-fry, and the sugar and vinegar pork is particularly delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but other dishes only take a short time, and it's very quiet, so you don't have to worry about making a mess when stir-frying, and you don't have to worry about not being able to cook it!
Received the goods, I couldn't wait to cook three dishes at noon. It's really amazing how technology has changed our lives. The temperature and seasoning control is precise, and the taste of the dishes is upgraded to a chef-level. It's great for those who are not good at cooking. I highly recommend purchasing it!
I have added a new member to the kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machine, the kind that automatically controls the heat and flips the food.
You no longer have to fear being scalded by hot oil, and you no longer have to fear overcooking or burning the food.
The stir-fried vegetables are tastier than the ones I cooked, and the stir-fried egg with tomato is particularly flavorful. The chicken eggs have a great texture.
This pot is a good value.
The text translates to:  "It's good, worth buying, very good."
Overall, it's very good, very clear, and consistent with the description.
Worth having.
The customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and easy on the eyes. I haven't noticed any other abnormalities yet.
Compared with the mainstream displayers nowadays, it is thicker and the border is wider, with a larger gap between the border and the screen, but the screen display effect is good, and the accessories are complete.
The logistics speed is fast!
The merchant's service attitude is good!
It took some time, the quality is good, and the screen resolution is also very clear.
Stir-frying stocks is very cool, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 4, it's too perfect.
The logistics are fast, the goods are good, the second one I bought is indeed good stuff, with high-quality display and no loss of fidelity due to a larger screen, with complete interfaces.
The feeling is good, the color restoration is good, and the quality is acceptable!

South African doctor: Although the transmission power of Omicron is strong, most cases are mild.
Many doctors and medical experts in South Africa believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to the Associated Press, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the South African province of Gauteng have reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu.
The organization's director, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pei Li said, "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation."
He said that this includes elderly patients and those with pre-existing health conditions, as these groups are more likely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19 infections.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta variant, the COVID-19 patients he treated had "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels."
Many people will need to be hospitalized in a few days.
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences.
Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the doctor's observations and early evidence have provided some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe symptoms, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave. The average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. In recent COVID-19 cases, only 3% have died, while the death rate was 20% in the early outbreak in South Africa.
The director of the African Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute of Communicable Diseases and other reports saying, "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "Right now is still the early stage, we need to obtain the data from the later stage."
Under normal circumstances, the time of hospitalization and death usually occurs later, but we entered this wave of the epidemic only two weeks ago.
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods.
Although Delta is still one of the major COVID-19 virus strains worldwide, Omicron cases are now appearing in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, in the first week of December, the number of new cases in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, increased by 400%. Tests showed that over 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.
Thank you to today's supporters, all 80 boxes have been sent out!

Yes, I have changed a driver.
He has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has been saying "handling" for a long time.
I have waited for several hours.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know.
But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time keeps being postponed.
I'm sorry, but I cannot translate the given text as it is incomplete and lacks context. Please provide me with the complete text or more information so that I can assist you better.
In summary, I did not call.
Haven't eaten yet.
I will definitely file a complaint.
You can't send it, why didn't you tell me earlier?
I've been waiting for you for so long.
I didn't receive the call.
Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.

Hello, the live chicken delivered by the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it. So, I want to find an affordable practice partner first.
Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the degree of friendliness, if you can't distinguish, then the normal ones will be more friendly than the cheap ones, this kind of "entry-level drum" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak. When the ball hits the racket, it produces a very large vibration, and the hard ball cannot withstand it. Even skilled players find it difficult to control.
Their logic and underlying words are - "It's so difficult to play tennis, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to buy expensive ones, so I'll cheat you with a cheap one, you'll play twice and never play again, that way this racket is cheap and you won't feel bad."
When you can truly distinguish between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come back to me then, and I'll make two times the profit.
I suggest spending a similar amount of money on a used racket that is a bit better, such as Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not very popular, so good rackets won't sell for high prices. A new racket for 500 or 600 yuan is fine, and a used one for 200 yuan is a great deal. Wouldn't it be enjoyable to have the experience of using a racket worth a thousand yuan for only 200 yuan?
The text can be translated to English as follows:  "The game is quite friendly to new players, but after the newbie stage, it becomes a pain in the neck. However, most people, especially female players, cannot get past the newbie stage."
The order has been repeatedly delayed in terms of delivery time.
May I ask for your help in following up on this matter?
Delay
Thank you
That is to say, I already have credit, right?
Next, do I need to place another order? Can I ignore the previous one?

In the next three years, Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural primary school music teachers - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 22 (Reporter Chen Yuxuan) According to a report from the Jiangxi Education Department, in order to strengthen the shortage of teachers in certain subjects and ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, starting from 2016, the Jiangxi Province has planned to train 1,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for each primary school in the province's rural areas (villages and towns) over a period of three years.
According to understanding, the training objects are primary school teachers in Jiangxi Province who are 45 years old or younger and have a foundation or talent in music, art, and physical education, and are able to teach other subjects in addition to music, art, and physical education.
Through training, they can master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music aesthetics, update their teaching ideas and concepts, grasp modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus cultural ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of music aesthetics teachers who are proficient in multiple areas, alleviating the problem of a shortage of music aesthetics teachers in rural areas.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to provide training for 100 counties (cities, districts) in primary school music, art, and physical education, with a total of 300 trainees. The training aims to comprehensively enhance their demonstration and leadership abilities in teaching, their ability to design and organize teaching research activities, their ability to conduct training, and their ability to build online research workshops. This will play a role in teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes, we can't wait for another 20 minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.
I have found the buyer of the previous incorrect order.
But my tire is missing.
Hello, when will the ordered food be delivered?
I have finished my work.
Your driver's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
Could you please provide a reasonable explanation?
Sure, but your driver has some issues. Please handle it well.

OK, if it's really not available, then return the money for the reservation.
Actually, there are many requirements for clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight.
"For girls who are overweight, the length of their skirts should not be too short or too long. The length should be around the knee, covering the fat on the thighs just right."
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on the legs.
A text that is too long can give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you separate the top, middle, and bottom into three segments, it will appear that you have naturally grown taller. Simply use different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks, and it will create a sense of elongation.
Actually, many dark-colored clothes are the signature of chubby girls (the author deeply understands this point). Dark colors are also a good way to conceal your chubbiness. The noble and elegant black mini skirt is also the first choice of chubby girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make people think you look slimmer.
If your legs are very fat, don't wear socks and shoes that are too noticeable.
The more popular it becomes, the less vivid the color should be.
To avoid people paying attention to your legs and feet and getting the impression that you are overweight.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it's important to teach them the tricks of dressing and matching clothes.
Don't wear tight short skirts, and don't wear tops that are too short or stuffed into your skirt, as it will make you look uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black tights or grid tights (the kind with fine patterns). Choose a soft and flowy printed tube top, and pair it with a blouse that has a ruffled collar. This can cover up the shortcomings of a chubby girl quite well.
Of course, chubby girls are also particular about wearing short skirts.
The chubby girl wearing a short skirt should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt. This will enhance the effect of making your figure look taller.
Wearing a short skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the IN thing to do in the summer!
If you are an MM with a plump upper body but thin legs, I recommend choosing a short skirt with a sense of grandeur.
This text can be translated to English as:  Not only can it cover your belly skin, but it can also showcase your advantages.
A-style skirts are very slimming, especially suitable for plump girls. When choosing a top, it's best to choose something that fits tightly and creates a layered effect, which will make you look even slimmer.
Simply wear a white T-shirt with a short skirt, even the chubby MM can try it.
The chubby girl can also exude a sense of fashion when she dresses up.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing matching, even the chubby girl will become the focus of everyone's attention.
After changing in the clothing coordination aspect, it's also important to exercise more in daily life and strive to shed the label of "chubby girl" early in the morning 😄

Is there only one shrimp dumpling order?
Why does a clock have 6 hands?
I won't go.
I am a delivery person.
This 1 hour no one has contacted me, this is basically online fraud.
Do you think I'm calling for takeout for the first time?
After the investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order.
Alright, thank you! How many days is it?
From 7 pm to now 9:30 am, it has not been delivered yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Sure! The Chinese text "好的" translates to "okay" or "alright" in English.
Claiming to be the loudest exhaust in the Xinshan District!
This time, our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4!
The price of this car is close to two million yuan, and the annual road tax is several thousand yuan. It has four wheels and is called LP700.
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is?
According to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. By the time my small car reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h. Wow.
The low car body, the imposing scissor door, the huge air intakes covering the car body all around, and the glass-bottomed 6.5 v12 engine that leaves nothing to be desired, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini.
For the description of the car model, you don't need to say too much. You can just Google it. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google.
Too much attention has been paid, where everyone is looking, I feel a bit uncomfortable (but also a bit excited)!
1km fuel cost is around RM1 (car owners don't care at all)
The posture for getting on and off the bus should be practiced a bit, otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing (because you won't be able to get out of the bus and get stuck halfway).
The engine noise is too loud, you will be deafened when you get off the car (but it's still very exciting).
The car is too big to fit in a regular parking spot, and I'm afraid of getting hit by the gate of the neighboring car when they open it.
A little lonely, because there is no opponent on the road (I'm talking about myself, not related to the car owner, haha)
Please don't misunderstand, the supercar in this video is not for sale, sorry!
If you want to shoot a video for your car, welcome to contact us!
More car information that you don't know is on The Car Guide / People's Automotive Encyclopedia.
Involved in a car accident worth millions!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are cars that most car enthusiasts are familiar with. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of Porsche 911 is also in the six-figure range!
A few days ago, foreign countries crashed millions of supercars, including Porsche 911 and Bugatti Chiron, in just a few minutes.
Based on the results, you are right!
I ordered a package and two things were delivered incorrectly.

Alternatively, you can call me directly.

The maximum duration for Guangxi university students to take a leave of absence to engage in entrepreneurship is up to 5 years, according to a report by Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, May 19th (Reporter Zhang Ying) According to a recent report from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Bureau, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system and relax the limit on the duration of study for students. The duration of on-campus study and entrepreneurship for students who take time off from their studies can be extended by 2 to 5 years based on the existing academic system, and the time spent on entrepreneurship during this period can be counted as practical educational experience.
To promote the improvement of entrepreneurship and innovation abilities among college students, the Guangxi Education and Human Resources departments have collaborated to establish entrepreneurship platforms, build more off-campus practical teaching bases, university science parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, to provide external support for college student entrepreneurship.
According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases for undergraduate schools should exceed 30,000 square meters, and for vocational schools, it should exceed 20,000 square meters.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship courses, and prioritizes supporting outstanding students in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to switch majors.
College teachers should go to industrial enterprises for at least two months of on-the-job training every two years to improve their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Education Bureau of the Autonomous Region requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the university student innovation and entrepreneurship training program, striving to ensure that every university student participates in a innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their school years.
Universities should actively organize students to participate in various innovation and entrepreneurship competitions at different levels and provide financial support.
Does he have the correct address?
I haven't seen it yet.
That courier just delivered to the wrong address, so I didn't receive it.
However, I have received it.
The translation of the text from Chinese to English is:  "The app is currently unable to connect to the driver."
My family thinks there isn't.
But it has already been 1 hour.
"Mài lè jī, méi shì mài lè jī jiàng."  Translation: "Mái lè jī, méi shì mái lè jī jiàng."  Explanation:  * "Mái lè jī" means "chicken" in Chinese. * "Méi shì" means "there is no" or "there isn't" in Chinese. * "Mái lè jī jiàng" means "chicken sauce" in Chinese.  Therefore, the sentence "Mái lè jī, méi shì mái lè jī jiàng" means "There is no chicken sauce" or "There isn't any chicken sauce" in English.
That chicken is going to be tough to eat if it's not cooked properly.

Thank you to all the staff who helped with the wedding photo shoot today. I look forward to seeing the finished product.

The makeup artist designed a makeup look for me that was tailored to my face shape, and the photographer captured it in a humorous and charming way, which was well received.

"Asian-American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net"
Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei): More than 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a joint complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, protesting against the three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - for discriminating against Asian American applicants during the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.
The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three American top schools has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called "holistic review" admissions process.
Zhao Yu introduced and said that in 2014, a study by Sanders et al. showed that among the three universities, the relative number of applicants and the admission rate of Asians were the lowest among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years.
Zhao Yukong told reporters from Xinhua News Agency that they hope the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation after they submit their complaint, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students after determining the facts.
They also hope that universities that have been complained about will proactively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.
Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons.
This time, in addition to the Chinese American organizations participating in the appeal, there are also Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American educational organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yushan Town, Zhejiang from a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory.
In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the family member of the property owner, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank as a deposit on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the recipient, which stipulated that if the buyer did not want to buy this factory, the deposit would be returned to the seller. If the seller did not want to sell this factory, the deposit would be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agreed to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week.
However, afterward, due to disagreements on key contract terms such as the scope of the factory for sale and payment methods, the property sale contract was unable to be signed.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract content, several days later, Mr. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu.
The house that was hard to come by, with the deposit paid and the down payment ready, was just waiting to sign the contract, but the seller suddenly refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu feeling helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yongjia City People's Court.
After the court's review, it is considered that both parties failed to reach a formal agreement, and it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant. Therefore, the case should not apply the penalty of double the deposit, and the defendant is not required to bear the liability of breaching the contract by paying double the deposit.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed.
Recently, the Second Circuit Court upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer's Reminder] It is necessary to exercise due diligence in the transaction process.
When signing a contract, as the buyer, it is necessary to fulfill the duty of careful attention, such as verifying the information of the owner of the property, whether the property is currently occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send the wrong address.

What is the method of drinking red card whiskey?
Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like collecting, some people like food, and of course, some people like drinking. Red Label Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won international wine and spirits awards.
Each bottle of red wine has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, you'll waste its aroma and flavor.
So, how do you drink Remy Martin cognac?
Here's a simple introduction for everyone:
Red card whiskey drinking method:  1. Pour a shot of whiskey into a glass. 2. Add a few ice cubes to the glass. 3. Slowly sip the whiskey, savoring the flavor. 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the glass is empty. 5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with a new shot of whiskey. 6. Continue repeating steps 2 and 3 until you have finished the entire bottle of whiskey.  Note: It is important to drink responsibly and not overindulge.
The Glenfiddich 15-year-old single malt scotch whisky is made from a blend of about 35 different Scotch whiskies. It has a rich and fragrant aroma with traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, and the fragrance has a sweet and smoky flavor.
The entry is rich and refreshing, with a hint of fragrance and a strong taste of smoked barley.
This alcohol can be directly added with ice to drink, or it can be mixed with your favorite beverage to drink.
Red wine enters the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the people, red wine + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other bubble drinks have become a perennial fashion trend.
These sweet beverages, in addition to being able to neutralize acidity, can visually bring pleasure to people and play a role in diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the sensation in the mouth when added to the drink.
Red cardamom+sliced lemon+sugar (cane sugar may also be used) is the most authentic and traditional way to drink it.
The authentic red method has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon can bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences.
The above three are the best ways to enjoy Johnnie Walker Red Label whisky. You can try them as a reference and hope that my introduction can help you.

Mrs. Jin's wedding photography (Nanjie store) does not have branch stores yet.
Before taking the photo, we had not arranged the time well, and we changed the time twice. The consultant Lanlan was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to shoot.
The staff of Jin Furen are all amazing, whether they are consultants, makeup artists, or photographers.
That was my first time doing makeup formally, wow~ I can't believe it, I will also become that beautiful one day, haha.
Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I forget her name) are very patient when doing makeup, and their makeup looks very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Kowloon City, and fortunately, the weather was very good that day, and we didn't feel too cold during the photo shoot. The makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothing, accessories, and if there was anything slightly off, she would immediately help us to tidy up.
The photographer is also very humorous and feels very happy when taking photos all day.
When choosing photos, because we have seen many cases online, we don't want to let customers delete too many photos. But when we were choosing photos, there was absolutely no suggestion to add more photos. We just took the 24 photos that were included in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister, who got married around the same time, had a wedding photo package that cost over 7,000 yuan and added over 1,000 yuan worth of photos. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many).
Today's photos are edited well. Lanlan sent them to me, and I found two of them not very good. They immediately helped me re-edit them.
Take out the photos that my sister took before and compare them with ours. I think our photos are really satisfying, simple and fresh, which is the style I want.
I sincerely recommend that everyone goes to Shaanxi Gold Wife to take wedding photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan
Mrs. Jin feels grateful for your sincere wishes and hopes that you will be happy and prosperous. The road ahead is like a brocade!

You are called Zheng Meng, this is your second week in Japan.
You were walking on the street when you suddenly realized someone was following you. You were scared and started running faster and faster until you finally took off.
That person is behind you chasing: "Miss! Wait a minute!" (full Japanese dialogue) You stopped at the door of the convenience store.
"Miss... I am a director. You look very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very suspicious, afraid that this is a scam.
He gave you a business card, and you discovered that he was really a director from a large entertainment company in Japan.
"If the little sister has time, we can go to the company to talk. The fee is definitely indispensable."
You came to the company a little messy, and he said he saw you on the street at a glance and hoped you could come.
You think there's no loss and you can still make money, so you signed the contract.

So how to handle that rider?
I think I cannot accept an order that takes more than 20 minutes to deliver.
Sabah's 3,200 newborn babies have no birth certificates due to the special anti-counterfeit paper being cut off.
(Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the special anti-counterfeit paper used for stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, and a total of 3,200 people have been affected so far.
However, the director of the agency, Kaeluaminus, assured that the information of all infants who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeit paper will be supplemented after it arrives next week.
At a press conference, he responded to a news report by a certain online media outlet that had been reporting on the issue of the Sabah newspaper's printing problems for 10 months.
He said that the problem arose two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same problem.
One of the reasons is that Chinese manufacturers producing anti-counterfeiting paper have been affected by the epidemic, resulting in delayed arrival in our country.
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from the inventory of other states.
Keryu Aminuos revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
The relevant department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to place an order next Thursday, and then immediately proceed to the final stage of printing in Sabah. It is estimated that it will take two working days (December 20th) to deliver it to the applicant's hand.
We will notify the applicants to go to various branch offices to collect the admission notices.
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 admission papers so far this year.
I have been waiting for more than 7 o'clock until now.
Is it almost time now?
I am referring to food.
I am waiting across from #PRS\_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you, the restaurant says it's ready.

Education News: Beijing Compresses the Proportion of Gifted Students for Junior High School Admission in Early 2016 - Xinhua Net
On the 21st and 22nd, the entrance examination for gifted students in junior high schools in Beijing was organized and implemented by the education committees of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have compressed the admission ratio for special-length students, making the competition for special-length students even more intense.
Taking the Dongcheng District as an example, the proportion of students with special talents entering junior high school this year in the district does not exceed 5% of the total planned enrollment of the district. The planned enrollment is 380 people, and the attendance rate does not exceed 10% of the school's planned enrollment.
Students who have physical, artistic, or technical talents and have registered online are eligible to participate in the talent student admission assessment.
To facilitate students to participate in the examination nearby, the Dongcheng District continues the examination arrangement method from last year, setting 1-2 examination sites in each school district, with a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination venues according to the examination districts, and the time slots are divided by hours. The students will enter the examination points according to the time slots on the same day and take the examination in different examination venues within the same district.
On May 23rd, the list of students who have passed the district education admission examination was announced online by the admission examination center. Students can check their examination results online.
Can it be delivered in 10 to 15 minutes?
I haven't received any food.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: I firmly believe that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 (reporter Zhang Jing) The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently stated that the Bosnian side is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period.
Recently, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, in the Olympic Center in Sarajevo.
When they met, Kovacevic actively evaluated the China-Montenegro relationship and expressed that he had a deep impression of China's excellent organizational work during the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008. He believed that China had the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period. The Montenegrin side is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Montenegrin Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation. The Montenegrin side hopes to use this as an opportunity to expand sports exchanges and cooperation with China.
Qi Ping stated that China and the United States have a special "Olympic belt."
The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains, presenting a simple, safe, and splendid event to the world.
We look forward to deepening cooperation in the preparation and training of winter sports events and athletes between the two countries. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue playing a bridging role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to continuously deepen people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, and let the people of the two countries move towards the future together. We also wish the Bosnian athletes good results in Beijing.
Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete Awards Ceremony," and Tiandian served as a special guest to present the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The State Council's joint defense and joint control mechanism has issued a document requiring the strengthening of epidemic prevention and control at ports of entry in cities, with a 48-hour negative nucleic acid test result and the establishment of a "buffer zone".
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11 (Reporters: Dong Ruifeng, Gu Tiancheng) The General Office of the State Council recently issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus pneumonia epidemic at ports of entry and exit, requiring personnel who have recently left land border ports of entry and exit cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to hold a negative nucleic acid test certificate within 48 hours, and to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arriving in land border ports of entry and exit cities.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city range and announcing it in each province, city, and district to March 15, 2022.
In addition, the notice proposes that conditionally open ports can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their administrative areas.
According to the person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border trade is a major economic pillar, and frequent exchanges occur between the two sides of the border.
Implementing a differentiated management policy with two lines of defense instead of one, we aim to achieve a shift in the frontline of prevention and control, compress the risk of spillover of the epidemic, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of COVID-19 in China, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry in cities.
The aforementioned notice pointed out that there are some problems with the monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel is not in place, the regular nucleic acid testing is merely formal, the disinfection of the entire chain of cold chain items is not thorough, the management of centralized isolation sites is not standardized, and the epidemic emergency response is not scientific and precise enough.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism at ports of entry, strengthening the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures. The aim is to quickly fill the gaps in the epidemic prevention and control system at ports of entry, without any relaxation, to do the work of prevention and control in a scientific and precise manner, and to tighten the external defense line to prevent the importation of the epidemic.
The notice emphasizes that cities at ports of entry should synchronize the work of epidemic prevention and control with the protection of people's livelihoods, and publicize and ensure smooth access to the hotline for people's livelihoods. They should regularly investigate and address potential risks in areas such as the supply and pricing of basic necessities of life, and proactively respond to and resolve prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the cities at the ports of entry include those with open land, water, and air ports, as well as the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (prefectures, cities, leagues) where they are located, and the directly administered cities. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

Exposing the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhua News Agency  (Note: The translation is a direct and literal translation and may not convey the intended meaning or tone of the original text.)
(Video source: Bilibili)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the Bilibili platform sparked widespread attention.
This film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghanistan War under the pretext of "anti-terrorism," forcibly exporting American-style democracy through warfare, resulting in 20 years of impoverished soldiers, bloodthirsty nature, indiscriminate killings, and various anti-human atrocities.
Abusing drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, distorts humanity and forms a murderous group.
Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and physical humiliation.
One atrocity after another is inciting more hatred among Afghans.
As the video said, the US "anti-terrorism" war is becoming more and more terrifying.
War did not bring peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only brought a country full of wounds and countless deaths and destructions.
Let's watch the video together to uncover the truth about the United States using the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to engage in bloody slaughter, and to expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
The food delivery was late, and the food had cooled down. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard, and it was completely impossible to eat.
And the soup has spilled out.
Immediately cancel it. The things he sent have definitely cooled down by now.

I have used #PRS\_ORG# multiple times before, but today's experience was the worst.
Completely unacceptable
Sure, I can help you with that. Here's the translation:  "好的，可以" translates to "Sure, I can" in English.
But it is also necessary to remind the restaurant and the delivery riders.
Avoid happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time.
At that time, the schedule was repeatedly postponed.
I don't know when to wait.
If you cancel an order, can you get a refund for the deposit?
How do I pay the service fee to the driver?
"A rider has been confirmed more than an hour ago."
I am not willing to wait any longer.
Don't scare people at the starting line - Xinhua Net
When strolling in the book market, one can often feel the heat of popular educational books.
The successful self-help books of today often preach the "best principle" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do.
It is equal to saying that the child has passed the "how to do it" stage, which is actually the most important and fundamental link.
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they finish with a bang, or they don't do anything at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just wait in place.
This "best principle" is recognized as "absolutely correct" by everyone who sees it, but 99% of people are still intimidated before the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a decision to remake yourself and undergo a 180-degree transformation," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people.
For those who adhere to the rules, follow the old ways, and resist change, you should shout "You must transform!" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the fool.
Most people will feel fearful, hesitant, and find it difficult to make a decision when faced with the word "transformation". Sometimes, they may make a hasty decision to undergo "transformation" with a momentary impulse, but it often doesn't last long, and they soon give up and fail to maintain it.
Mr. Ma Sanli's famous "From Tomorrow Onwards" dialogue most vividly demonstrated this "universal human nature" classic.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the barrier to entry is too high. It often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, leaving the vast majority of people feeling frustrated and disappointed.
Perhaps, "the second-best principle" is a path that may allow more ordinary people to walk towards a relatively successful life.
The core principle of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, even if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still good: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dunes in front of your home is also fine, because that is still better than staying in the same place.
In summary, as long as you do something, it will always be stronger than not doing anything.
Due to the lowering of the threshold, it has become possible for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres, the chances of success will increase.
The path to success in following the "second-best principle" is slightly longer.
In summary, the "best principle" claims to promote the success of everyone on the surface, but in reality, it can only effectively motivate a few. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
No one answered the phone.
Delay after delay
It hasn't been sent yet.
May I ask for the delivery time?
How can I contact you?
Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He is two meals short of delivering, but has completed one order.
I would like to ask, how to contact a delivery rider?
The first driver just told me that there should be another driver coming.
The naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 71,000 tons this year, according to Xinhua News Agency.
Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongyang) According to the latest monitoring results obtained by reporters from the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, the storage capacity of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year compared to last year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This represents a cumulative increase of more than 40 times compared to the protected initial period in 2002.
The naked carp in Qinghai Lake is also known as "Yangyu" and is a valuable fish species found only in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin.
In the 1960s and 70s of the 20th century, due to human activities such as large-scale killing and degradation of the breeding environment, the number of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply decreased. In 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake was only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species".
Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented the "Closure of Lakes for Fish Culture" policy, prohibiting any units, groups, or individuals from fishing for naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries. The sale of naked carp and its products is also prohibited.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and releasing, as well as measures such as cleaning the main river channels of the inflowing rivers into Qinghai Lake and designing scientific and reasonable "fish passageways," the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has continued to increase annually.
The vice director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of 1.8 billion fry have been artificially bred and released into Qinghai Lake for the restoration of the naked carp resources, with a contribution rate of over 23%.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water source recharge zone not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of desertification from the west to the east.
In order to protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan region and the Qinghai Lake water area, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, this year, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, establishing a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".
I used my #PRS\_ORG# RED credit card to spend over $180 on food.

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, even though the weather was cold.
May I ask, is the takeout delivered in a bag?
We only see a bag.
Would you like to know if it's missing or if someone has taken it? Thank you.
It's been 1 hour already, but it still hasn't been delivered.

Taking a foot bath and feeling a tingling sensation in your feet, is that a sign of an electric shock?
Choosing an appropriate foot bath can have a good therapeutic and health-preserving effect on foot care. Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hopes to be of help to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a wide range of products with different price ranges have emerged in the market, from over a hundred yuan to several hundred yuan, providing consumers with a large space for choice.
In the relevant data table, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk.
"Swimming in an electrified river with your feet submerged is really too dangerous, isn't it?"
Mr. Li told reporters that recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused the feeling of numbness in his feet, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet.
Mr. Li tried it with a pen, and the pen surprisingly lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was conducting electricity.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still quite good, even though the bathtub was returned. Mr. Li still felt a bit disappointed.
Because he found that this already popular bathtub has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety guarantees.
However, in general, shower trays are not likely to have electrostatic problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing.
Therefore, when buying, choose a bathtub with a partition.
"Water and electricity are separated, there is no safety hazard."
At the same time, you can take the pen test casually.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily - Huasong Online  (Note: The translation is a direct and literal translation, and may not convey the intended meaning or tone of the original text.)
On December 10th, the Hunan Daily reported (reporters: Zhang Changwu, Hu Panpan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, photographer: Li Jian) that this morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Expo and New Changhe Red Tea Promotion Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the pursuit of a tea industry worth 1,000 billion yuan.
Vice Chairman of the National Supply and Marketing Cooperative Association, Hou Shunli, and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony.
Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, grandly introduced at the opening ceremony: The source of Lake Hong is in Xinhuan, and the rise of red tea has injected new impetus into "Five-Color Tea" in Changsha.
In recent years, the Provincial Committee and Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of a thousand-billion-yuan Changsha tea industry, forming a development pattern of "three Changsha, four waters, and five-color tea."
In the tea industry within the province, innovation is being stepped up, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to exert their strength. Tea-producing areas are promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving large-scale tea farmers to increase their income.
The wind water turns alternately, red tea exerts its power again.
According to tea experts in the province, the tea industry can provide income for tea farmers all year round by harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea. The value of tea gardens is also on the rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leader presented the certificate to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Lake Red" trademark, and new Changhe welcomed the "Lake Red Source".
At the Xinhua Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a tea merchant from Fujian saw a type of high mountain tea called "Ice in Spring" and immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said happily that the current epidemic and other factors have had an impact on the tea leaf market to varying degrees, but from the tea exhibition site, highlights are emerging one after another.

Therefore, this month you can enjoy a $20 discount with the #PRS\_ORG# RED credit card up to 4 times.
I didn't receive the order, can you help me check if the rider is still on the way?
Hello, can you help contact rider and ask if they are still on the way?
I have not received the order, and after checking, there are no food items. No one has contacted me to say that the order has been canceled.
There is takeout during normal times, and the building management office will call to ask and then let someone in. But the management office has never contacted me.
Design, ubiquitous (Translated from Chinese)  Design can be found everywhere. It is an essential part of our daily lives, from the clothes we wear to the buildings we live in, and from the products we use to the websites we browse. Design is not just about aesthetics, but also about functionality, user experience, and problem-solving.  In today's world, design has become a crucial factor in the success of any business or organization. Companies invest heavily in design to create products and services that are visually appealing, easy to use, and meet the needs of their customers. Designers use their creativity and technical skills to come up with innovative solutions that can help businesses stand out in a crowded market.  Moreover, design has also become an important tool for social change. Designers are using their skills to create products and services that address social issues such as poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. They are working with governments, NGOs, and other organizations to create sustainable solutions that can improve the lives of people around the world.  In conclusion, design is an integral part of our lives, and it

Time Capsule Photography Temporarily without branches
Member evaluation
[Effect] Photo effect: I took two pieces of clothing. Overall, it's not bad. I prefer the photos in this set.
[Service] Service details: Because I felt a bit uncomfortable during pregnancy while doing makeup, the makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while, and they kept giving me hot water to drink.
Package price: 1000 yuan
Thank you for the rabbit's evaluation. Originally, I said that rejecting the ancient style was not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can fill us with energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard!
This photography studio is really great! I strongly recommend it to all my friends!
Regardless of whether it's reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, or post-production, there is nothing to criticize.
The makeup artist is particularly delicate and will match your makeup style according to your preferences, using only top-tier brands.
Mr. Tian's comment is no longer necessary. Photography is indeed a profession.
The entire studio is very artistic and there are two little kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and it takes half a year to queue for the popular movie theaters in Beijing. My colleagues have shot some films in Beijing, and after watching them, I think they are just so-so.
I specifically sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is quite poor, and we feel that this is also the case for most people. Photographer Liang Ge will capture and record natural and wonderful moments.
Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a top-notch team.
When it comes out in sheets, we and the people around us can't stop praising it.
I have already recommended it to my friend, and my friend just watched the movie and is equally delighted.
I hope this kind of studio won't be buried and more people can discover ta, create their own style instead of being uniform.
Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Xueying and Jingling. Both are very creative and innovative newcomers, and we are a creative studio. We will do our best to complete any project that our clients like, and we are grateful to have met each other.
A sweet and considerate assistant, as well as a lively and outgoing photographer teacher, every member of the team is super nice and had a wonderful experience during the photo shoot. It's an unforgettable experience, and the results of the photos exceeded my expectations by a lot. Thank you all! 😘😘
Thank you for your review, knowing you is also a kind of fate. From Chongqing to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers. I am very happy to know you, and I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao again to play.
How should I give money?
The re-sent meal has been delivered.
There is no driver to receive.
Now the restaurant staff is calling me.
A programming novice who wants to share personal experiences.
If you are planning to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the money spent on training is very expensive, and it takes six months to learn.
However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed an excellent choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. Training is an even better choice for them.
If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing.
Firstly, we need to look at the institution's faculty strength. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, then this training institution would have no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a selection, it is best to probe a bit into this training institution. It would be ideal to inquire about the students who have graduated from this institution, as only its former students can truly know how good or bad the courses offered are.
Hello, I actually don't know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your own situation, which is closely related to learning this thing.
For example, professional, age, even which city, these are all related to the industry you want to learn or work in.
If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer major, and if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many offline and online training institutions that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is quite substantial. You generally need to focus on training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet now, or you can also go to Bilibili for a lot of training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources, or you can consult me in detail.
In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining them with videos.
If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, learning doesn't have to be very tiring, and the teachers explain in detail. There are also people dedicated to answering questions, and in terms of study planning or supervision, there is also assistance.
Moreover, many training institutions now sign employment contracts and have internal referral quotas. After studying, they recommend going to companies. This way, the job interview process in the future can be simplified.
Above are my views, as mentioned earlier, due to not knowing your situation, I only gave a general introduction and did not go into detail. If you have any other questions you would like to consult on, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion at any time.
I said I would be there at 1 point, and I saw it in the app.
What is called
I haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I undertake various services such as installation, cleaning, repair of wall-mounted stoves, hot water heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stove tops, oil heaters, lighting fixtures, and glass polishing. I also provide professional sewing and household services.
Thank you to those who have silently given me likes. We struggle for a living, life is tiring, but we must continue.
Life won't disappoint those who make every effort. If you like me, please follow me. Thank you to those who silently gave me likes.
Life is like this, others only see the results, but we have to endure the process alone. When facing life, besides being strong, we have no other choice but to continue. We can look back on the road we've traveled, but we can't go back and retrace our steps.
Cleaning is a job and a responsibility. Life is beautiful because of service, and service is exquisite because of dedication.
Although cleaning is the dirtiest job we do, we approach it with the most serious attitude, cleaning every corner of our customers' homes until they are spotless. Seeing their satisfied smiles and raised thumbs, at that moment, all the hard work is worth it, and the effort pays off!
My daily work
Your request, my service.
"Heartfelt service, heartfelt cleaning, preserve the beauty."
The details you care about, Fengguo Home Services have done to "clean" as much as I can, serving with love.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English:  保万家洁净，树家政囗碑，服务到位，洁净到家。
Indoor and outdoor cleaning, this is my daily work.
Although the crystal lamp is magnificent, if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly, just like in life.
Success comes from doing things with care, and exquisiteness is achieved through meticulousness. We take our work seriously.
Give me a chance, I guarantee you will be satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, your recognition is my greatest motivation!
The current situation in various industries is not easy to handle!
But I always believe that as long as I maintain a serious attitude, persevere, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who just complain and do nothing.
The plan for a day begins with the morning, and all beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you carry happiness, luck, health, and a good mood as you set off for a new day. May you maintain a good mood throughout the day. Good morning.
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed; when we grew up, happiness became a goal to be achieved; but as we matured, we realized that happiness was actually an attitude, and once we understood this, we were happy.
Be the truest and kindest version of yourself, guided by your heart, and you will have no regrets in this life. There is only one path in life, walk your own; the two treasures of life: a healthy body and a good mood, shine brightly and live happily until old age!
In every stage of life, one will encounter different difficulties.
Often, what binds you is not your ability, but the courage to face things positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it's better to face it head-on.
The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be defeated by difficulties; but if you face challenges head-on, problems will eventually be resolved.
The curators of the Central Academy of Fine Arts are collaborating to organize the first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia - Xinhua News Agency
Xinhua News Agency, Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Guan) The first contemporary art biennial exhibition in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the JAX Art District located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition is co-organized by the Diriyah Biennale Foundation in Saudi Arabia and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, with the director of the UCCA, Feng Yuan, serving as the artistic director.
According to the curatorial team's introduction, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Feeling for Stones to Cross the River", which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period and reflects the current state of Saudi society and culture.
This biennial exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Feeling for Stones to Cross the River", "Experiment as Inheritance", "Borderline Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art".
Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works in this exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create with recycled materials, such as Xue Huan in the "Behind the Story Series: Qi Shan's Endless Picture" (2014), who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Diriyah Biennale Foundation CEO Bakri stated that he hopes this year's biennale can establish international dialogue and allow global audiences to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community, enhancing interaction and communication.
Tian Fuyu said: "The goal of the biannual exhibition is dual. On the one hand, it allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and on the other hand, it allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to understanding, a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biannual exhibition. Artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.

Yunnan: Regulate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net
Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) In order to continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken populations and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently launched policies to promote the management of public positions for rural revitalization and related rural public welfare. This will help to comprehensively promote rural revitalization.
The responsible person of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs introduced that currently, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used for the employment of poverty-stricken laborers and other disadvantaged rural groups, and play an important role in helping poverty-stricken people achieve income growth, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects.
This regulation was jointly issued by the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Rural Revitalization, the Ministry of Finance, and five other departments. It mainly standardizes the scope of recruitment for public welfare positions at the grassroots level, financial management, position development, and position management.
In terms of position development, the new regulations clearly stipulate that it should be based on the principles of "needs-based position setting, position-based staffing, dynamic management, and quota control", as well as the principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary publicity, and unified management".
The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, public announcement, employment, pre-job training, and assignment to the post.
In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the departments mainly responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for the subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the departments in charge of rural public welfare positions to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel in those positions. It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.

Hello
Can the order be canceled?
I will place an order again.
Has it been canceled?
Although the rightists have had their moments of glory in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they receive a little bit of sunlight, but wilt away when faced with a little bit of adversity. They quickly gain momentum when things go their way, but collapse when they encounter setbacks.
But to speak the truth, the rightists played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From defining the standard of truth after the end of the Cultural Revolution, to the development of the economy, the improvement of science and technology, and the promotion of institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied.
Three, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he has to say and I respect him as a person. Because he is sincere, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution inevitably leads to social upheaval, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic mixture of political groups, with foreign powers taking advantage of the situation.
Four, to change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who try to seize power opportunities in the political arena are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about that again.
On the left, there are actually a group of orphans of history and politics.
If we say that the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary. But the left has lost its way because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
Translation:  Five, I recently saw some friends mocking the left-wing and anti-thief at the same time, and they were quite energetic. I think it's not necessary at all.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists. It's a lost cause, there's no reasoning with them.
Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making thieves and the left acknowledge it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the bandits curse you for five mace, and when the leftist curses you for being a rightist, it just proves that our middle way is the right way!
Many people have ideals when they are young, but later forget them or become obsessed with them.
As one moves away from ideals, even a young dragon slayer may become an evil dragon.
I think left and right generally refer to constraint and freedom, and historically and culturally, China has a predisposition towards the left.
While the domestic right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, the left-wing strengthens regulation and places greater emphasis on fairness and safety.
Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the competition between China and the United States is inevitable, and being left-leaning is certain. It is estimated that this will continue for many years to come.
Although I can't understand it, a like is enough.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a translation for this text as it does not appear to be written in any recognizable language. It seems to be a combination of characters that do not form coherent words or phrases in any language that I am aware of. If you can provide more context or clarify the language used, I would be happy to try and translate it for you.
I'm sorry, but I need more context to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide more information about the text you would like me to translate?
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "weird" hot searches.
What is normal public opinion?
At random, select three hot topics: February 2nd's "two dragons lifting their heads," Hulu's price increase, and the "goods going up and down" incident. The public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index drops (with a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there may be small peaks reappearing.
They look completely different from the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" previously displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion?
Randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event and presenting them in a "lonely peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" shape.
The following text has been translated from Chinese to English:  【孤峰状】 refers to human-induced heating, which quickly rises to the top of the hot search list and attracts widespread attention; 【锯齿状】 refers to periodic heating, which ensures that the topic remains on the hot search list; 【断崖状】 refers to collective withdrawal, where the hot search topic has fulfilled its "function" and moves on to a new task or a new battlefield.
In Figure 9, the peak of the heat wave of one event is exactly the trough of another event, with a time difference of only seconds. This must be the unified water army receiving a task and launching a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches appear on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke, which ones shift attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, and which ones interfere with decision-making. Black PR accounts are deployed in batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, taking into account almost all the elements of the spread and diffusion of public opinion.
Propaganda is a science, discarding all subjective factors such as positions and emotions, and only relying on objective data, even public relations will be powerless.
Leave a trace wherever you go, and let's dig out those traces together.

Mauritius and other countries first discovered cases of omicron virus infection. - Xinhua Net
Beijing, December 12 (Xinhua) - Comprehensive reports from Xinhua News Agency correspondents abroad: Mauritius, Cyprus, and Seychelles have recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the new coronavirus.

These 3 people are all students who returned from an overseas trip at the beginning of this month. Since they all have mild symptoms, they have not been hospitalized for treatment.
To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, the government of Sao Tome and Principe has been increasing its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, passengers aged 12 and above who enter the country by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test upon arrival at the airport.
The Saudi Health Ministry announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.

The translation of the given Chinese text "收到是金钱肚" to English is:  "The stomach is full of money."  Note: The phrase "金钱肚" literally means "money stomach" in Chinese, and it is often used to describe someone who is greedy or materialistic.

Your driver told me that the address is too far.
"Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decor"
Address: No.156, Huancheng South Road, 12th floor, Happy Garden
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and see. Initially, my budget was 70,000 yuan for basic renovation.
Upon arriving at the store, a series of scams began.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plan. They did not even go to the site to measure the house. They could give me a quote and say that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't know what brand the materials were.
Their second scam is that once you go to the store, they will drag you into giving them your deposit (and once you give them the money, you will never be able to get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you how much discount.
This is a big pitfall, and I am a living example of being cheated. I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan when my mind was racing.
He gave me a quote with many problems. The 70,000 yuan does not include water and electricity renovation, and does not include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, which are the basic costs.
Excluding the fees they charge at their service points, their fees are higher than those of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything to me at the beginning and made me sign the contract.
When I went to ask for my money back, they seemed very experienced, with a dedicated small team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it happens, biting someone to death is always the customer's problem, and they are completely blameless.
Various shifting of responsibilities, as well as many details, are too numerous to mention, and it would be too sad to go into them one by one. In short, do not choose them, because my friend found that the houses they renovated were of poor quality and charged various fees in the end.
The text translates to:  "The scammers, they were just the decorative heads of the swindlers before, now they've become big and fancy, as if they've gone bankrupt and transformed into something else."
So don't choose such a bad decoration company.
Afterwards, everyone should check these consultations when choosing, because renovation is not cheap.

Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if 15 minutes or less could be canceled.

Can you first exempt me from paying the monthly fee until your investigation is completed, and then collect it afterwards? Is that possible?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's already almost 3 o'clock.
Is that for compensation?
I said to deliver goods by knocking on the door.
But the messenger was left at the door, and then the person left.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided doesn't seem to be complete or coherent. Could you please provide more context or clarify what you would like me to translate?
Your delivery rider has already taken my order #NUMBER# for takeout, but is still showing as "waiting" now.
The delivery rider received my order at 19:25, but still refuses to leave.
May I ask if you would like to order any other takeout after I finish my purchase?
What should I do?
Where did your driver go?
Do I have to wait longer?
I am going to take an exam.
Alright, if you don't cancel, I'll report it to the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

You can use the promotional code to make up for it.
There's no problem, you don't need to arrange for a resend. I have already purchased it separately and don't want to waste it.
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept the behavior of attacking people's character.
In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this kind of scoundrel.
If we don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing we need to resist is this uncivilized behavior.
From the moment you sent me a Facebook friend request and posted mocking posts, to your attempt to publish what you claimed was my home address and father's name on social media, I have adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After you left, you became even more intense and didn't just tag me once a day for six meals, but also continued to discuss some ambiguous and derogatory remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook without any restraint, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether to insert something about me in bed... I... have had enough.
How did I know later that I received more photos of you and sexually harassing comments from several friends on your Facebook account?
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent.
After I reported the news, you showed no restraint and became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your identity and status. In our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary.
Yes, you can continue with this kind of sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you are only concerned and caring about me. You can believe that this is not harassment, and you can even deny that those images were not made by you or continue to publish all kinds of attacking statements.
No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you.
I neither know you nor want to know you. My appearance and figure are of no concern to you.
I don't even believe that any girl would be willing to allow others to humiliate her so much just to become famous.
My friend asked me, "How are you?"
I said it, but you wouldn't believe it.
I think it is unlikely that any girl would say she is doing well after being bullied to such an extent.
Regardless of whether it's in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even basic morality would choose to use this method to harm any woman.
I believe that justice resides in the hearts of people.
I selected some comments for everyone to evaluate.
The post you sent should not be able to be impersonated by anyone, right?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization.
The Chinese phrase "会心一笑" can be translated to "smiling at each other" or "laughing together" in English. It conveys the idea of two people sharing a joyful moment and enjoying each other's company through their smiles and laughter.
I have reported and attached a picture, but have not received a reply.
What cow, no cow
It is a live chicken, fresh meat.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a translation for this text as it does not contain any coherent information or context. Please provide a complete sentence or paragraph for me to translate.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not leftovers?
unacceptable
I have already placed an order.
It says it will be delivered at around 7 o'clock.
Why do we need to remake?
It's too out of tune.

It will launch better policies, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions to support talent innovation and entrepreneurship, and hopes that outstanding talents from all walks of life will join forces to promote the high-quality development of Hunan.
The activity set up exhibition halls in Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Shaanxi, as well as the Hunan Free Trade Zone Exhibition Hall. The Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Industry and Information Technology, and the Department of Human Resources and Social Security of Hunan Province released the Hunan Advanced Manufacturing Industry Science and Technology Innovation Demand List, the Hunan Intelligent Manufacturing Industry Talent Demand Catalog, and the Hunan Postdoctoral Flow Station Intelligent Manufacturing Industry Young Talent Demand Catalog.

The home of the high-speed train
Address: No.555, Beijing-Guangzhou High-Speed Railway. See map.
Here, the home appliances are quite comprehensive, with many brands, including well-known ones.
On December 22nd, go to "Hansdon" water purifier store to see water purifiers. There is an activity going on inside the store with relatively favorable prices.
There are a total of 11 floors in this building, from the 2nd floor to the 9th floor. Both the 1st and 2nd floors are designated as parking areas, and parking is free during the day.
The surroundings are not very good, there are few restaurants and shops around, and the taste of the restaurants is mediocre.
This elevator is also speechless, like a serious illness, from floor 2 to floor 1, going back and forth, I keep pressing the button for this floor, from the emergency exit to the first floor, it's also speechless, directly leading to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed, and the emergency exit is inaccessible!
Surprisingly, there is still room for improvement, as there are many areas that have not been developed.
Address: No.555, High-speed Railway North Road, Shuibei District. The location is convenient with a large parking lot, and parking is free during the day.
Environment: The truth-telling store is quite large, with 8-9 floors. You can buy all kinds of furniture, home appliances, and various small things you need at home. Many well-known brands have also settled in the store, such as Rongshi, Oupai, Huade, Laoban, Fengchuang Zijia, Hansdun, Yake, Youbang, Silun, Fupinjia, Wanjiale, Dazhongyuan, Zhonglian, Meide, Yadan... The brand really is too many, and I can only remember so many. It's a good place to buy products, and you can take a break and rest on the sofa when you're tired of shopping.
Recently, I have been thinking of buying a comfortable sofa set, and my friend told me that there are many sofa sets available here to choose from. I have looked at the sofa sets at Home Mart and Mei Ke Mei Home, and they seem okay, but the prices are slightly higher, so I am still undecided.

The text translates to:  "The mainstream of the Yangtze River has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua Net"
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, December 11 (Reporter Wang Xin): The Chongqing Shuicheng Green Integrated Service Zone was officially put into operation on December 10 as planned, which is the second green integrated service zone on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Green Integrated Service Zone in Sichuan Province was officially put into operation on December 8.
At this point, the green comprehensive service area on the water has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.
The vice director of the Ministry of Transport's Changjiang Navigation Management Bureau, Qiu Kehua, introduced that before this, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had already built and put into operation 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang River, which have been widely recognized by sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Changjiang navigation.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the green navigation on the Yangtze River, which significantly improves the reception of ship pollutants and the service capability of navigation.
According to introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for ships and crews, and to help a large number of seafarers solve the "urgent worries" problem.
This time, two water-based green comprehensive service areas have been built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, integrating life services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the highlight. It realizes the "one-stop docking, multiple services" for ships in the port area, which will make the sailors who have been navigating on the Yangtze River for many years work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
I canceled it a long time ago.
You keep postponing.
But the live chicken in the box is fresh meat and cannot be eaten. Can I get a refund?
Peach, steamed dumplings, and buns haven't arrived yet, but #PRS\_ORG# has already refunded #NUMBER# yuan.
But can the mouthwatering chicken be refunded?
Because there's no way to eat when you're born.
Can I cancel if I want to?
