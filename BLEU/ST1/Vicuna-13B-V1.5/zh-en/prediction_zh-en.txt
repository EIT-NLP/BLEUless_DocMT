现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。

ASSISTANT: Most people will feel fearful, hesitant, and find it difficult to make a decision when faced with the word "transformation". Sometimes, they may make a hasty decision to undergo "transformation" with a momentary impulse, but it often doesn't last long, and they soon give up and fail to maintain it.

ASSISTANT: Perhaps, "the second-best principle" is a path that may allow more ordinary people to walk towards a relatively successful life.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。

ASSISTANT: The core principle of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, even if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still good: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dunes in front of your home is also fine, because that is still better than staying in the same place.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。

如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。

ASSISTANT: If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer major, and if you have enough time, I personally suggest self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, there are many offline and online training institutions that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is quite substantial. You generally need to focus on training for 3-6 months.

但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。

ASSISTANT: But if it's the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient.

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, I suggest you go to a training institution to learn.

There are also people dedicated to answering questions, and in terms of study planning or supervision, there is also assistance.

而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。

ASSISTANT: Although the rightists have had their moments of glory in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine brightly when they receive a little bit of sunlight, but wilt away when faced with a little bit of adversity. They quickly gain momentum when things go their way, but collapse when they encounter setbacks.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

ASSISTANT: But to speak the truth, the rightists played a positive role in the process of social progress.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。

ASSISTANT: Three, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in what he has to say and I respect him as a person. Because he is sincere, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。

ASSISTANT: But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution inevitably leads to social upheaval, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic mixture of political groups, with foreign powers taking advantage of the situation.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: Four, to change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who try to seize power opportunities in the political arena are not rightists, but scoundrels.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

再聊聊左。

ASSISTANT: Let's talk about that again.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。

ASSISTANT: On the left, there are actually a group of orphans of history and politics.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！

ASSISTANT: If we say that the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's words and analyze their thoughts when necessary. But the left has lost its way because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away!
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。

Five, I recently saw some friends mocking the left-wing and anti-thief at the same time, and they were quite energetic. I think it's not necessary at all.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。

ASSISTANT: Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists. It's a lost cause, there's no reasoning with them.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

ASSISTANT: Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about making thieves and the left acknowledge it. Why bother?
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the bandits curse you for five mace, and when the leftist curses you for being a rightist, it just proves that our middle way is the right way!

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: Nowadays, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness. At the same time, the competition between China and the United States is inevitable, and being left-leaning is certain. It is estimated that this will continue for many years to come.

ASSISTANT: At random, select three hot topics: February 2nd's "two dragons lifting their heads," Hulu's price increase, and the "goods going up and down" incident. The public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index drops (with a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, there may be small peaks reappearing.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

ASSISTANT: The following text has been translated from Chinese to English:

【孤峰状】 refers to human-induced heating, which quickly rises to the top of the hot search list and attracts widespread attention;
【锯齿状】 refers to periodic heating, which ensures that the topic remains on the hot search list;
【断崖状】 refers to collective withdrawal, where the hot search topic has fulfilled its "function" and moves on to a new task or a new battlefield.

黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。

ASSISTANT: The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches appear on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke, which ones shift attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones incite emotions, and which ones interfere with decision-making. Black PR accounts are deployed in batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, taking into account almost all the elements of the spread and diffusion of public opinion.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。

ASSISTANT: Propaganda is a science, discarding all subjective factors such as positions and emotions, and only relying on objective data, even public relations will be powerless.

ASSISTANT: I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plan. They did not even go to the site to measure the house. They could give me a quote and say that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't know what brand the materials were.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。
