The item cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a #PRS\_ORG# VIP customer, so it's not a problem for me.
I simply need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find that, to be honest, quite frustrating.
Must I cancel the order and place a new one for the better price, or is there another way to get a credit?
I fundamentally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings.
However, I think it's good for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings to some extent.
Take a quick look, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc.
In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 is busy for a short time and it's okay for him, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether it is suitable for your children.
It is not the case that he should wrap up K2 and accompany him for hours while he falls asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable.
Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
For if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2.
Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago, and I can remember almost the entire plot, but the title won't come to me. Maybe someone here knows the title...
The story was about fear and how to treat it.
At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and entering his enclosure with the big cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, ends up at the therapist's clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is a new protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the location and document it, and then post the photos online.
In any case, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and the patients ultimately subject themselves to their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death)
This confronting of fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with fire.
This is roughly the plot, I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or someone even reveals the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available.
I must first contact my husband.
But that can take time.
What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
"Kind, 4 j., Splinter under the thumbnail"
Kind, 4 years old, has splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) for the entire length.
We have tried to pull it out with tweezers.
Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and caused pain.
Now the child reacts hysterically when we try to do it.
No more chances.
Tomorrow, I'm going to the doctor.

Due to Omicron: Johnson will push for booster vaccinations
New cases of the Omicron variant are causing concern among politicians and scientists in the UK.
Therefore, all eligible adults in England will receive an offer for vaccination by New Year's Eve.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to accelerate the COVID-19 booster vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing Om
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
One is facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, which is why the vaccine protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine.
"Let's boost now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in the United Kingdom, bringing the total to 3137.
Compared to yesterday, there was an increase of a substantial 65 percent. dpa
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone being addressed with pronouns.
I have sent an application.
Today, I received an invitation for a conversation via email.
I want to respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have googled him/her and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write the email now.
Can someone help me, please?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes either.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books.
4 of them go.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect at the time of sale.
How can such a damage to the foam occur after 9 months otherwise?
First try it on the #PRS\_ORG#.
This has been working for about
14 days no longer.
Therefore, I have always bought the latest books from the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
However, there were no more.
Now they are available again, and I would like to ask you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
The feeling when I can't help.
Content Warning: I will be writing somewhat extensively about domestic violence here.
I must simply write something from the soul.
I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them.
I am perfectly clear that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I am unable to do anything in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear, I am sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth being able to live without violence.
I would like all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't.
It will become easier, but it will never be easy.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, it is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: Is the series suitable for "League of Legends"?
Much fantasy, many complex names, an awe-inspiring presentation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Giants Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was abandoned.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, however, it did not calm down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the German Basketball League.
Whereby more than the bare result disappointed the way of appearance.
Substituting, let's call it a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was a mere 13%, 4 baskets (all by the young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions?
The answer provided by John Patrick was: "We were simply not focused enough after the victory in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, to move the ball.
Quite differently, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: "A cool game for the second time to win against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people ago."
There were only 750 visitors allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game for his team.
"The best playmaker that I have ever trained", praised Gleim further.
While in Patrick's team, even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to deliver across the board.
Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and come within eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points.
Fortunately, there is not much time for brooding.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I have changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again for this reason.
We had originally already registered half a year ago.
Always peeled like out of an egg: Max Raabe turns 59
He is able to captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good Day, dear Luck" - if he is allowed to appear.
Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't make a difference.
The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to curb the spread of the Corona virus.
Other planned appearances by the singer during the Advent season must also be canceled, as stated on the website of the singer, who is celebrating his 59th birthday today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then make up for the dates that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his youth.
In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchestra together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of hit songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was frequently awarded prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women, this is not a problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He has succeeded in bringing it from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable from the current German-speaking music scene.
With the program "Good Day, dear Luck" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance?
It can be supplemented with existing furniture and in this way we can check in advance whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only sew the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing.
The new Federal Minister of Construction, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as demanded in a Berlin popular vote.
"With expropriation, no new apartments are created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday).
My goal is to give tenants the security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly.
In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party will establish an expert commission to decide how to handle the outcome of the popular vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rent law.
The coalition agreement provides for a rent control until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will be speaking with the Minister of Justice to implement it as quickly as possible.
If the rental market doesn't loosen up anyway, "we will talk to our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and it occurred to me a few days later that I forgot the last step in the payment process.
Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again?
Or whether it will come again at all?
#PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
The text "Gutschein klingt super" translates to "Discount sounds great" in English.
Then I will place the self-employed person with the new order.
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on my finger.
That is an absolute audacity
At least 100 people have died due to tornadoes in Kentucky.
During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the USA.
In Kentucky alone, there could be more than 100 fatalities to lament.
The pictures from there remind me of a war zone.
In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives.
The storms leave a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of devastation, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of that state, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone everywhere the tornado had passed through.
Houses, shops, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He is counting alone in the state of Kentucky, with up to a hundred deaths, official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME is sold out.
That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced?
Or is it completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order these vitrines in another country?
Until when do you report yourself?
If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had returned an item through the contact form and asked if it had been received or processed, as I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans
While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccine premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for vaccination.
By doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - is intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He switched to a company where he was harassed.
That does not improve his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea.
It is a year ago.
He has clearly not stuck to his old place and has been looking for something else.
You may also do that.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter.
He didn't find his job very well either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign
Boron greetings!
I am currently leading an adventure for a group of 4 friends called "Over the Griffin Pass" and I want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players.
We are playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been planned, and now I am writing the introductory adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet.
The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action should develop.
Some miles away from the village, a group of goblins is supposed to ambush the hero and lure them into a trap.
I would like to give the player characters the ability to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, intimidating, recognizing the danger early, whatever occurs to the players.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed.
If the hero doesn't notice, the goblins are lying in ambush for him in a ditch and flank him to the left and right, each with three bows armed, while two with spears stop the wagon.
If a battle were to occur and the heroes were to lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf.
The cart is, of course, gone.
2. If an defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his henchmen and comes to the hero's aid in battle.
The cart is still there, everything is super.
How do you rate Deus ex Machina from Solution 2?
Is the Encounter as an introduction to the adventure too much?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.
wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas into account and now also have more trust in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again.
And put back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Therefore, I would still like to return them.
Can you then have the receipts brought, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

Is everything then taken back or only the storage space?
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1
Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I would like to take a little breath with this post.
Firstly, the transmission was interrupted mid-way through the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.
Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning had put the schedule far behind schedule, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it is the case that F1 has priority for legal reasons, and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice in this matter.
Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcasted the race live.
Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident.
Then there was again confusion about the rules in Formula 1 among commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen may change the tires when there were appropriate radio messages about this topic to Hamilton.
Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that there was a possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known if one comments on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster.
It is also not the first puzzle solving, which is now allowed or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
I do not like the artificial commentary style of Roos in general, but I acknowledge that it is a matter of taste.
But I actually like Heiko Wasser from RTL seriously.
In addition to this, there are constant foolishness that both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher.
Just the latter brings a lot of unease into the comment, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the out lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is sufficient directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
"These two channels also make less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air channels."
Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.
Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, even when it comes to advertising.
Thus, the grandiose F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
To the here: #PRS\_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered.
I have contacted the chat twice and received nothing so far.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email, and she has never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after relatively short time (the material has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
Air pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over air heaters.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the end of the offer in the table.
Here you can see the services in comparison.
Are the pumps strong enough to operate entire facilities with them?
Owning a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable so that multiple outlets can be connected.
The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. However, air pumps are also available to add an accent to the aquarium, such as a curtain (available at our shop) or decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell, or something similar to name.
The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The blower pump is connected to an outlet or the like via a 4/6 mm air hose...and off we go.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside.
If the fan pump is located lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed between them.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between.
This would prevent it if water were to flow backwards from the bucket through the pump...
If the blower pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps.
The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily.
If everything is going well on the way, it is going very fast.
We just want to bend a little, so that no one is upset, just because it took a little longer this time.
It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry... of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not judge it poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that lies exclusively with the parcel services.
One naturally likes to swear about these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally.
Be angry with no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests?
Could one also have the legs painted in a lighter color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and presenter into space
The daughter of the first American in space, a TV presenter, and four other passengers have undertaken a short space trip.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The takeoff and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly selected astronauts upon their return.
"Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds underway and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for their ticket, Blue Origin did not disclose.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded
He worked hard during his deployments and had to do everything on his own.
She was simply carried away, said the 74-year-old with a laugh.
Michael Strahan also expressed himself enthusiastically.
The moderator would like to return to space as soon as possible, he said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated.
The capsule that was separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: On the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second launch in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was also present, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely promoting the business of space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.

Someone who works in biochemistry or has studied biochemistry.
I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and I find the subject itself quite interesting, and the lab work doesn't bother me (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical).
I have, of course, also already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies. At that time, I also thought that I would definitely want to study until I get my doctorate.
At the moment, however, doubts are arising, especially the professional prospects are oppressing me.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears about great career opportunities and the profession being highly sought after, while on the other hand, one constantly hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions.
Therefore, I would really be interested in:
What are you currently working on?
2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
3) What have you studied/ What kind of training have you received?
Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really unsure and considering dropping out of my studies in 2022 and becoming an IT specialist instead.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them :)
Extra stress during holidays and weekends
This topic came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it.
Therefore, let's add a post now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas vacation, is there a lot of stress in our company.
As it seems, there is also available during holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend at home.
What happened last week?
Everywhere stress.
According to the emails that absolutely had to go out before the start of the long weekend, there were orders here and orders there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend.
Because... well, because?
Because "next week then" sounds so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one?
Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also really annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment due to holidays?
Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent.
My question is simply: Are we, the Swiss, the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way?
Or do you know it in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but she hasn't received any gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH.
You will agree to the party by baking and bastele with your son.
"I love that", said Catterfeld.
Up until the contemplative days, she still has quite a bit to take care of: "I haven't gotten any gifts yet, I need to start taking care of that finally."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth running of the moult and the feather renewal.
NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage.
The majority of feather damages in bird keeping are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of flawless feathers.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet should contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered.
NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I have found it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are it.
I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle beam is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What do we do now?
I cannot build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced.
The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder.
I am also receiving new ones.
When will they be released?
No, no flat ones.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right ones in terms of shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter.
The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose
At me, they are not flat.
Could I get this sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and significant damage
Two people were slightly injured in a fire at a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
In addition, a estimated damage in the five-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday.
The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with mild smoke inhalation on Sunday.
The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not assume a deliberate arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But it comes much later  (Note: I couldn't translate the last word of the sentence as it was not specified in the original text.)
And I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccination photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status so far.
Now the entrepreneur has published a photo that shows his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has moved him to share, Sahin said.
The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has released a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I am supposedly not vaccinated.
"Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine", wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors."
So far, he has rejected it because the communication should not revolve around himself.
But a call last week changed my opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life."
He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks.
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Shahin further.
He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust.
Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time.
There is a prioritization for vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted a long time ago - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power
In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no electricity and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had rendered a transformer station inoperable.
After a fire with heavy damage at a substation, ten thousand people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to do without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening, a fire affected 41,000 residents in several municipalities, causing the lights to go out.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and female helpers of the THW provided support in the communities.
The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their efforts.
We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant limitations.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) for their tireless efforts, said the head of the Primary Technology Department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will still take several days, as the Westnetz technicians had to temporarily reconnect some cables, explained he.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company's statements.
Electricity is flowing again
The fire that broke out around 7:15 pm on Friday has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation, according to reports from Westnetz.
There will be extensive cleaning and repair work required there.
In addition, an connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Further 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 23:15, even those who were last affected by the outage have had no electricity.
Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies were deployed.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon.
"It is important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially older or single people, and inform the local fire station when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes.
In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools, according to authorities, for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros?
It is about the daily cover #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the base on the tabletop.
It is about Custom #NAME#.
There are 3 implementations.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I can't stack them and thus shorten them.
Can you help me there?
Otherwise, I would have to return them, as they are not suitable for the purpose.
I would be pleased to receive feedback.
Yes, that is really easier!
Then we'll do it that way!
Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed.
I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS\_ORG#.
Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost shameless.
We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins
The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to surrender again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping into the trail.
Return of order number #NUMBER#
When will the money be credited back to my account?
Yes, we have both updated and are using version 4.5...
It could be that they have already heard of the problem several times.
I have directly bought a book from my #PRS\_ORG# and it seems to be the right one.
As soon as I want to open it, the message appears: ups!
This document cannot be opened.
The file may be defective, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file.
Can you help me further?
Is the chat connection gone and now?
I must work in between as well!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clean water, and dry.
Before you bring the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup.
The first stroke on the building component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke.
Light overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush.
As a result, unrealistically appearing surfaces are created.
A model is not a garden fence.
Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later.
Metall tones and metallic colors come with a separate brush at the very end.
Otherwise, unattractive metal flakes may occur when they mix with normal colors.
Allow the painted parts to dry for a day before sanding them.
The models achieve their original appearance through the decals or peel-off pictures.
From emblems on aircraft to ship names to decorative stripes and model numbers on car models: decals give the model the final touch.
Arrange the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible.
An aircraft cockpit can be or is more easily covered before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are patience, time, and a steady hand when it comes to applying stickers.
Cut out each required decal individually and arrange it to your liking.
Decals are also known as water slide decals because you moisten the back of them briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark from the moisture.
Then you just push the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you gently pull the carrier paper to the side.
Attention: Always check first if the picture is sitting correctly before you completely lift it off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth.
Attention, not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and find my place up to where I have read.
On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive this by email?
Is this translation correct?  Yes, for all 3 packages?
For the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Nevertheless, thank you very much!
Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Do I get the problem back, though?
Fertility treatment under private health insurance / What is an "insurance event"?
Hello everyone,
We were in fertility treatment for some time, but now when it comes to settling the account with the private health insurance, they are suddenly being uncooperative.
In order:  (Note: "Der Reihe nach" is a set phrase in German that means "in order" or "one after the other".)
We had applied for fertility treatment for children in advance at the statutory health insurance (PKV) and received approval for three attempts.
The trials were in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) restricted.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was accounted for under the PKV.
Some time later, we tried to have a second child, and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the PKV yet.
We again applied for cost coverage with the statutory health insurance (PKV) and were granted three more attempts.
After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, logically we charge the most expensive ones to the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first offer expire.
The second desire for a child should be a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment and ends when there is no longer a need for treatment."
The questions for the experts in this round are:
Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (we have 5 attempts to reimburse)?
Should the health insurance have pointed out to us in the assurances that with a birth, the further attempts would become invalid?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance event?
The infertility (caused by blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here.
Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants per email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
In order.
We will no longer order from them.
If you add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), it is obvious that you have lost a good customer.
They may certainly forward it to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now you're telling me that I have to send it back first.
I can't really do anything about the fact that the commode is completely disturbed when it arrives with me.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written.
There it is clear and unambiguous that the repayment was triggered and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers.
My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment using his account.
We will no longer do that.
No, the defect only occurred after several months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use.
Otherwise, they may not sell it as an office chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging.
I will disassemble the wardrobe and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG#
These products are advertised with additional purchasable cushions, but unfortunately, we cannot find them with you.
Can you help?
Weekly Theme: The Best Low Budget Movies
What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
A low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
One can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com, on the internet.
Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it?
And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture.
Wanted to negotiate the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now also reliable?
Thank you very much

Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Partial victory" against Belarus comes at high costs for the EU
According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs would be very high and would involve significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border between Belarus and Poland and Lithuania, Bossong told the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, declared the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not exactly small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while.
The handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, ruled Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided to take a stand against it, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time.
"She apparently can't assert herself when a member state insists on doing things its own way", as is currently the case with Poland, which doesn't even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
In addition, the EU is paying a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong. The agreement on the asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened.
Another attempt at crossing the border  (Note: This translation assumes that the text is referring to a literal border, such as a national or territorial border. If the text is referring to a metaphorical border, the translation may need to be adjusted accordingly.)
According to reports from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to cross the border from Belarus into Polish territory.
55 migrants were arrested in the night from Sunday and returned to the border, said a spokesperson of the authority on Sunday.
The Polish officials were attacked by the migrants with stones near the place of Czeremsza.
According to the information, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
Overall, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU or attempted to do so in the past months.
The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler of Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed border sections.
The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners are traveling to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving.
The most effective element of the EU's reaction would be pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial measures."
Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not geared towards the fact that the security apparatus regularly pushes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial Formula 1 finale
According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - Mercedes has lodged an appeal after the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi.
The silver arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, where he is said to have overtaken irregularly.
A second protest was lodged against the rating at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules.
Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the last lap of the race and won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman overtook the car in front of him.
I am checking that.
I am speaking with the bank and will report to you again.
Thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting the SC Freiburg-Fantag.
The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fan Day.
As the park announces, members and holders of permanent cards of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day.
Additionally, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters shone through the jerseys red and white on that day.
"Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop," said the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg.
At the first SC Freiburg Fan Day in the Europa-Park, it has once again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Shining fans can be seen enjoying the roller coaster together, which confirms what Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack says."

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
Within the framework of the reading series "LiteraTour North," author Judith Hermann read from her current novel "At Home" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also acted as moderator.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast and listens sensitively to the nocturnal sounds at her front door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and wrongly delivered cheap goods from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not all from our household.
Please contact Mrs. #NAME#.
I cannot chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I, or Frau #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# dessert, and a return label.
This email did not come yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS\_ORG# today still.

I'm sorry, but just because he says he isn't an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true.
That's like when a racist says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of you will admit your "i" to me.
But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply let it go completely.
Yes, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions the evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost.
For my part, God has set everything in motion.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense.
And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken any more seriously than Kollegah.

#PRS\_ORG# will provide very friendly and good service, although it took a while to reach a person, you were great.
Hello dear #PRS\_ORG# team,
I have already contacted you under the customer service number #PHONENUMBER#.
Yes, but it was called something else before.
You cannot deliver from England due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Fir tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees.
Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations when selling Christmas trees.
Once, a man even drove home alone without his partner because they couldn't agree.
Every year he plants about 2000 pieces for that.
There, the 56-year-old has already experienced many curious situations.
This always makes the pre-Christmas period a bit funny, he says.
And what about the coupon?
Otherwise, am I as a customer gone?!
At least I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price for it.
Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to lead discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both of them have their name.
In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which certainly doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic
We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble building a stable WiFi network.
Before, I had a 50 Mbit DSL connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly and received and sent 50 Mbit with only a few exceptions.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, they also arrive.
However, at the other DLan module, which sends out the wifi, I no longer get the full 500, but the more I move away from the module with the device in the house, the less I get (so I use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower in the first floor than before (~45 Mbit).
I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were also similar losses.
Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost through the power line with fiber optic?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely labor-intensive to still lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I have created an account here.
Therefore, I would be all the more pleased about an answer.
When it's time to change the current account  (Note: "Girokonto" is a type of bank account commonly used in Germany for everyday banking transactions, similar to a checking account in English-speaking countries.)
Who would have thought that there would be no rest for the Giro accounts now, would be mistaken.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past once again with various tricks, the allowances for negative interest rates are also falling further.
The Deutsche Bank, for example, was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has halved the allowance and even quartered the daily allowance.
In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request.
And this not only applies to new contracts, but also to "newly agreed individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered the limit to 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as is the case with ING Deutschland.
The popular among cost-conscious customers direct bank DKB has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have now a credit limit of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox.
Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers there, which even won in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions - in case the higher instances declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally illegal and millions of euros have to be refunded to bank customers.
The tablecloth for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people.
The subordinate clause is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs an entire beauty army
She is now officially at the helm of Hollywood.
But their life is like a journey up and down a mountain.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen as the most influential woman of the year by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter".
For her, who made a stir in 2021 with the reunion of "Friends" and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work.
An army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
At least, that's what Aniston says, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag).
That your hearts, both male and female fans, nevertheless equally beat, is actually a miracle.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck with fate - and is still looking for the great love.
And crossed out the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother.
It hurt her.
The people who asked don't have a clue about what's going on with me medically, why I can't.
It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also make one happy.
Undeserving end of a career: Räikkönen has to retire
Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the tire, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sports
The goal of the bobsled pilot is the brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes.
I have calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg.
First, he repelled Johannes Lochner's attack on Saturday by five hundredths, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove 0.30 seconds ahead with a larger lead on Sunday.
With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd win in a row.
The Berchtesgaden-bound driver from Stuttgart, Johannes Lochner, previously came in second, but this time he finished in fifth place.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished in eighth place after placing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner.
Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka
On her homeward journey, Laura Nolte achieved her third season victory in the two-woman bob among the women.
After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she stormed to victory in the German triple success with brakeman Deborah Levi in the bobsleigh World Cup on Sunday.
Two-man bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen.
She recorded, in addition to her Olympic qualification, the first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig.
For me, it was supercool to finish first on the podium in the World Cup, I am superhappy that Mariama is with me.
I am super happy with the development.
"There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in the shopping cart and could buy it now!!!
What should I do?
I have not received it either, and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked.
Due to Corona, I had completely different problems last year and never enough time for it.
And now they said he had expired, which really annoyed me.
Look in the chat, it was about the Asare bench.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only started on March 16th?
There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I type it in does an extra field appear with the message.
Was handed in by your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, you know, a new undamaged one.
And don't cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY...
Hello dear wonderful girls and women,
I have something I simply want to write about, and perhaps it will be of interest to someone else as well.
I am 24 years old, I have kPTBS, I am a full-time student and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child 1-to-1.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, he has burned himself 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday, I visited him because I also have emotional needs, and because I want to see and feel him. We cuddled a lot, and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn).
He is also cold and we are currently seeing each other less frequently (1-2 times a week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is currently suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and stroking him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have homework assigned to us, which we naturally divide among ourselves.
But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is currently quite well under control, I am relatively well-treated and managing alright.
Not good, but I'm managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (personally), tomorrow at 3:00 PM I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and on Thursday I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little bit.
And next week I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar, not in my head because there is no more space.
My week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend.
But then does everything continue?
Only until the birthday.
Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend.
Only until...
And so it goes on forever.
I believe I am simply so stressed that I need these mental guidelines, otherwise I won't be able to handle it.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way...
Does it also happen to you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I am truly grateful, I cannot express it in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise.
I think this also has a lot to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a refreshing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color and surface is scratched and there is a print on the tablecloth.
Upon the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
When we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for the cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
In addition, twice.
It was confirmed, but not ratified.
Something completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is just another subject for them like math or geography.
For me, this has always been somewhat strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you feel about it?
Perhaps you can also talk about colleagues from work or studies with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate them.
There is also a curriculum etc.
But wouldn't it also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity?
What leads someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserve culture or something like that?
I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not?  Please feel free to write in English, I understand it well.
That is already very long, then I would refrain from doing so.
That's good, thank you.
I am expecting a response soon, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please
Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24 years old).
I believe it was a movie for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure).
Since I cannot describe it in more detail in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean).
For some reason, paths cross and an action arises.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can live.
I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other.
If this resonates with you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept on her stomach since week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child can endure much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, occasionally go in and take a look, but no continuous monitoring.
That drives you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattress.
No pillows.
So, we didn't have a sleeping bag, but always had a blanket.
Observe your child when it sleeps.
Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something be raised from the stomach?
Or is it with the face facing down directly on the mattress?
You can deduce from this whether everything is in order.
We are also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was the custom and practice to lay the children on their stomachs to sleep.
Additionally, we are already a "regular customer" at your store and have bought many articles.
But why are you then only offering me 20 EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet.
It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (Order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet.
I kindly request you to contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I myself know that not everything can be held.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this broadcaster are now completely discredited.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then also go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster.
Quote Arno: "One does not want to be a continuous billboard."
What are you now?
An 0815 advertising broadcaster trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
The rules naturally apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people.
A manager who lacks empathy and tries to make ash out of the rented rooms that exploded at the expense of the action.
How should one find all of this good?
Great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
I am requesting a recall, as the wooden table that was delivered to me is defective.
"Corpus break due to damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#."
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling – my little heat friend is versatile in use.
Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits are very good at absorbing heat and releasing it again in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven.
The soft grip makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when things don't go so well for them.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is exclusively intended as a heat application for the following areas of application:
Before warming up the kiss on an atypical odor, stain or burn mark, check and dispose of immediately if present.
Please remove the pillowcase before warming the pillow!
In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions for the microwave!)
Translate the following text from German to English:  Distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it after heating!
Then lay the inner cushion back in the cover.
During the initial heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications.
Please follow the specified heating instructions carefully, as longer times or higher power outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Please check before heating the kiss in the microwave that the heating of cereal products in the manufacturer's instructions is allowed.
After the warmed inner cushion was placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the cushion for baby suitability (max. 43°C) at your elbow.
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory discomfort, fresh bruises, blood clots, and open wounds, as well as for individuals with reduced pain sensitivity.
In the case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, or tumor diseases, as well as pregnancy, please consult a doctor before use.
If any seams have opened and loose beads have come out, dispose of the product and the loose beads immediately and inaccessibly to children.
If the product is applied to babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the child should be regularly monitored during application to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authorities in the country where the user is based.
The attachment is removable and washable at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of a return to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar.
It's not going well for Ingolstadt under the third trainer either.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken?
Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working.
I thought the power supply alone would be sufficient for operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the power adapter inserted.
After that, I removed the battery, but nothing happened here either.
Might you have ideas?
A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there anything else broken?
Thank you very much for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to be brought to my room.
How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair.
But I don't know how high the seat is...
Often on tour and yet a lot of equipment with you?
With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-liter capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers.
And as for the other everyday items you need, they remain well-organized and separable from the photography equipment thanks to practical storage options in the individually configurable interior space.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look.
The sleek, minimalist design has it literally - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide instant access to photography equipment.
This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid flap, which can be secured with the MagLatch locking system, a well-thought-out solution for effective protection that has already proven itself in the Messenger Bags.
There is a metal locking hook in the lock, with suitable anchor bars on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, securely welded, into which the locking hook can be hooked.
Is the backpack fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it's rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook being stretched.
The second feature distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid closure, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from the top - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
Simultaneously, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday practicality of the backpack: After all, you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you.
In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily separate and store both items without any problems - and also independently access them through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to, for example, reach the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left backpack compartment and don't get in the way.
Comfortable, easy-to-adjust carrying straps are helpful in this regard.
And because the outer layer of the backpack is made completely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it rains in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support.
#NAME# emailed me yesterday for confirmation of the commissioning.
Contact from the shipping company regarding the collection of the incorrectly delivered table has been announced.
So far, I have not received any messages.
I request immediate settlement.
I am now writing to the third support staff member, with none of whom I have gotten further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It can be seen when the cupboard will be delivered again?
To keep him in such a way is not an option for me...
It works.
Thank you very, very much for your help.
I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment was on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered.
Please call me.
If you extend the coupon for me, then I will place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and not returned it.
And that the past year turned out differently than expected, I could not have anticipated it and have not been able to redeem and clarify it in a timely manner.
But the damage as a customer, I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who appreciates reliability and safety in braking, even under difficult conditions.

Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that focuses on the selection of the disc according to the properties of the original installation.
The discs produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency.
Additionally created openings increase the effectiveness of the cooling of the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of every car by an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern junction of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49.
Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)!
In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will be searching for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and building businesses.
You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers have the same idea!
You must surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage.
With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style with fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), to 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions.
After that, their selection will be revealed and they will place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it will receive a ban!
This deactivates one half of the location - thereby reducing the possible actions there.
Then, the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes.
After all actions have been completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions.
This continues until the seller has moved five times, i.e. has hidden at each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits.
If the players have contributed enough gunman heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is calculated.
The player with the most victory points wins!
For free shipping, I offer the shipping method "Warensendung (Spiele einfoliert)" for items up to a size of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
With everything else usually DPD insured and with shipment tracking (play follows, wrapped in bubble wrap and packaging paper).

"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek
CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away.
The pediatric psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a welcome guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education.
Former patients and legal guardians are now raising serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to endure.
And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
To parents and other responsible parties, it must never, never, never! be about gaining power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are advising on the abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals.
The health ministers of the states want to decide on their next meeting about a nationwide lifting of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals.
"We, the countries, need quick clarity on whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag".
The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the following Tuesday. - afp
I also want to return the lamp.
What is the best way for me to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me further?
I am unable to settle any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#.

Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer.
I have updated the account details.
What could be the reason for this?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness*, which is sensory perceptions under general anesthesia.
These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less commonly seeing images, and most rarely experiencing pain.
Relevant for this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until weaning.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation.
Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, this comment of mine accurately describes awareness, however,** u/Nitemarex **by definition did not have any.**
I misread her comment.
The chair is, however, defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help either.
These are legal warranty claims.
The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is in addition to the legal obligation, also a standard in the field of eCommerce.
Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately.
We also lose quite a bit of money.
I have already sent you an email which you have not replied to.
Once again, the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice.
The shipper is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was informed that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that true?
If yes, I must cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why won't I be called?
I had formulated a question
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97.
He has profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
He later wrote a monumental history of theater.
On Friday, Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An old man gets older."
The shattering diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading, the message comes that the author has died.
The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby certify my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets, which are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL.
According to data from Statistics Austria, more than ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros.
How many pallets are imported into Austria annually is not recorded.
New York wins first MLS championship

In the final of the Eastern Conference, New York had prevailed against the Philadelphia Union, the team of German player Kai Wagner.
Rollover Tips & Tricks
I received many great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
There was this at Christmas, and it was incredibly delicious and buttery!
Thank you again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve.
Tomorrow, I will set up a cattle fund.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now?
What happened to the books and how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I'll manage.
This text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#.
I was already informed by email on 18.01. that the refund was made.
But until today, the money has not yet been received by me.
Would you please check that?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the space of Lübeck
For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Have you not yet bought any poultry?
Now is the time running out.
We will reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME, GAIN, and MASTER VOLUME controls, you can set both the desired volume level and the distortion content of your sounds.
Additionally, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL regulator, which allows you to reduce the sound level without changing the "Gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that you can even create a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator when it gets unreasonably loud.
Thank to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output.
The attached signal is processed with a boxing simulation, so that you can get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headset or direct recordings.
To the AUX input, a CD or MP3 player can be connected, so that you can jam along to your favorite songs.
A tuner function is also on board - so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also get a VFS5 foot controller, you can conveniently call up the sounds with your foot, turn the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects.
For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I have seen it with others.
Can you then send the lamp back?
Is it hung too low over a dining table for more than one person?
I would also like to return them, please.
Can you help me further?
And the chest of drawers?
Shall we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher as well.
Under certain circumstances, I may find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods that I don't need, spending over 1,000 euros is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# mirror (door) on the designated hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer, and the wait time was not worth it.
Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran is making progress in negotiations over nuclear agreement
According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are on the verge of agreeing on the agenda items to be discussed," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna.
This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, the Vienna talks on reviving the agreement had continued after a break of almost a week.
Participating in the negotiations are negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia.
Also, a US delegation is also present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state is now the state with the highest coronavirus incidence.
Thuringia has replaced Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000.
As the only federal state, Thuringia had a coronavirus incidence rate of over 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the seven-day incidence rate with 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which had consistently shown the highest incidence rate nationwide, the value was at 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased but was still above 1000.
In Thuringia, 2,242 new infections with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated in intensive care units on Sunday.
On weekends, there may be delays in reporting.
Furthermore, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand.
Since the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right?
Here, do I not have to click/enter/fill anything else?
I want to avoid exactly that, which is why I am writing to you.
I would like to request that I take care of the return at my own expense.
An 8-euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, an outrage.
It's time for changes
Greetings, Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall at the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is there a post here?
When one looks at the activity in the previous months of the German Bundestag, one can observe: it is not extinct.
We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer break for a few months.
Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem?
For the most part, this is likely due to dissatisfaction with how certain things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been an increasing impression that many people here still have a strong desire for the German Bundestag.
What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is asked which ones they want to keep alive.
The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found, to put it simply, a pile of shards.
After some back and forth writing, several people from the community have found the desire to rebuild the project.
However, I would like to explicitly call on everyone again to participate, only in this way can this project have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things.
You can join the server through this link.
Goals:
How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed?
How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
How should new members be recruited?
How do we create a fair election system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten some things, but that's not too bad, we have Discord at the end.
If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still to be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big/clumsy for that and not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different hanging from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I have a full refund.
This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: does the daily pillow #PRS\_ORG# come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective cabinet will be picked up promptly.
And I ask you to please make it happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup. They must clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how this will work.
#PRS\_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly?
How long would I have time to take care of this and/or decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like.
You yourself have lived vegetarian for a while, and currently you also rarely eat meat.
I was also a vegetarian for several years before.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and whether vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought.
And this is that I used to think that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point reflected and understood that I ultimately also support animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan.
At that moment, I had the impression that annoyance arose on their side, then they defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and that as a vegetarian, they reduced animal suffering.
Now I ask myself if my answer was too simplistic?
How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without one intending it.
It greets a vegan who loves harmony (;
This does not constitute an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code (BGB).
Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date, on which #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return in person.
Because I cannot attend the funeral in person, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup time?
Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available consistently.
Lahnsteiner Dam for water rescue equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state
Recently, the Minister of the Interior of Rhineland-Palatinate, Roger Lewentz, handed over a donation certificate worth 45,000 euros for the new water rescue vehicle of the volunteer fire department in Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros.
A good and important investment in security.
I am glad that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this matter, says the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte.
The device car is used by the diving team Lahnstein, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, they are permanently dealing with increasing deployments: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started.
I cannot open the book.
I have followed her recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app has not worked.
I am a bit frustrated because this whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I am hoping for help now.
Alright, that's how it is.
I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?
According to the ANSI/PLATO FL1 standard, the previously mentioned values were determined at the Fenix Laboratory at 21°C ± 3°C, 50%-80% relative humidity, and with the built-in 275mAh LiPo battery.

Thank you first of all for taking an interest in this whole matter. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, that is, we were also armed executives. I don't want to go into this any further!
I always find the question of right and left to be very oversimplified.
Generally, one should say that the state servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
It should also be clear to everyone that people who are attracted to the right-wing, conservative, and authoritarian should also be aware that these people naturally have difficulty dealing with the lived reality. It is also clear that in addition to the average white person, there are now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and also homosexuals (and I don't mean the overly feminine stereotype of gay men, because there are fewer of those in the executive branch), and to these people I can and must rely, because in doubt, they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative stance, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel more alienated by excessive left-wing politics, even if this politics supposedly speaks for them or thinks it has to make things right for them. They simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, of course, police and military are also a cross-section of society, where one will also find extreme right-wingers who are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly hatch state-threatening plans, which is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers, who are often deployed abroad, begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect.
It also happens that certain right-minded companions meet and engage in lively intellectual exchange.
Nevertheless, this is effectively countered by my opinion and also with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so deeply entangled internationally, and in my opinion, that's a good thing. We couldn't afford to have actual racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side.
Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out.
I already ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer deliverable.
I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket available in Germany somewhere else?
I always only find you as a partner company.
but at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow
And on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch.
May I translate the text from German to English for you?  "Ordentlicher durch Kind?"
Hello, I (w32) have been busy with something for a longer period of time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but I have been struggling all my life to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis.
There are always phases where everything comes to a standstill, and then every now and then it hits me and I clean up.
But it's actually never like "someone could suddenly drop by for a visit".
My husband is (unfortunately) not any better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time the household simply loses against work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook.
Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we are working on it and this question has been occupying me for a longer time.
For me, I don't have any motivation to clean, it simply doesn't bother me as long as no visitors come and there is always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Does one have a greater motivation with a child or do you remain sloppy?
I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality, anatomically pre-shaped cut offers a maximum of comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility.
Pre-shaping with special, more pronounced molding at the joints for improved mobility (in arm and knee bending).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort.
Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-formations in the lower back area and in the step provide for a close-fitting, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back ripping zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and putting on equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements.
Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body.
Seamless, thin (-2mm) sealing at the face on the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet).
The soft, collar-located zone improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment using a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop fastener that does not adhere to the coating or stitching.
Double-stitched zippers on arm and ankle joints connect a removable inner lining with a soft, coated neoprene outer lining.
45° Curl at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when pulling it on.
Long zipper at the nape of the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P Back-rip zipper (Overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent)
Clip fasteners on arms and legs  (Note: "Reißverschlüsse" is a German word for clip fasteners, and "Armen" and "Beinen" mean "arms" and "legs" respectively in German.)
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the ripping fasteners to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied.
Neoprene panels tightly bonded with both outer and inner overlapping.
"Edges of the outer sleeves reinforced for greater load capacity"
The edges of the inner cuffs are curved for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder?
I have completed an apprenticeship in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am becoming more and more aware that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering for some time starting again and studying social work.
The problem: I have a self-unsure (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPS).
This roughly means that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy.
I have no problem talking on a factual level with people, but it is very difficult for me to have casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe I have improved in this area).
Can I become a social worker like that?
I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete work routine is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet.
The ÄVPS is already causing problems for me emotionally in my job (for me, emotionally), because it brings me down every time there is something wrong with my code ("again, I've messed up the simplest things") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do this"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"he must think I'm really underprivileged" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
Did you already get the sofa back?
Because there was also no confirmation.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment.
What do you mean by "give back" please!
When I download a book from the #PRS\_ORG#, the message appears that the #PRS\_ORG# authorizes this book not.
Is there a problem?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken with the feed (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up its own protein substances from these again, which it also needs for feather formation.
The feather formation in the nestling and the feather renewal in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disturbances in the breeding process.
Following the brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be returned to the daily intake of NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 gram NEKTON-Bio in 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food.
It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A marked measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio.
For severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed.
Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair.
How can a desk chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months.
That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and I attached pictures.
Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community member in contradiction to the bylaws  (Note: I couldn't translate the last word of the sentence as it was not specified in the original text.)
Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
On our property, a walnut tree is to be felled.
Also a felling application has been submitted to the community.
An employee has written to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
But the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaws.
May I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I have not received a message.
Well, I still have a sofa without using it.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher?
What were they more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, the only question is whether I can pay in euros and have the cover delivered to Germany.
Can you check that?
Urgent Alert: Serious Traffic Accident in Selb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg.
According to the current police press alert (14:03), a car has crossed into oncoming traffic while overtaking.
There are injured people.
I understand.
Well, many thanks again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further career development
First of all, Merry Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is only moderately good because my dear head is currently dismantling everything that can be dismantled.
Before I now dig in here for advice... briefly: I need advice, and preferably from people who somehow know my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a beginner.
Initially, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me.
At some point, I ended up in the field of teaching and was sure that it was the right choice for me, even though the conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I Google other job postings."
And it's only been half a year.
Before I start painting, I always decide to continue and at least finish the underpainting. After that, I can still change my mind.
But I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted.
Now there are vacations, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my leisure time was my leisure time.
At that time, I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments.
Now the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me.
Generally, it's fun and from an external perspective, the REF runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I'm wondering how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it's not already doing that.
I'm asking myself if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work a bit boring, I was appropriately paid and worked together as a team, not as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back at the same place in a year's time feeling dissatisfied as I do now.
You notice that everything is somehow confusing, but perhaps as outsiders you have ideas or suggestions on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought about it.
I will not make decisions right now, as I am feeling emotional, which is likely to lead to nothing good.
But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me.
I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which, among other things, has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers maintain an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is based partly on real analog circuits, because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances seem to bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly how you've always imagined them.
The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.
The new VT+ Valvetronix series, ranging from the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit with a 12AX7 tube in every VT+ amplifier embodies the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers
The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable hook-and-loop fasteners, it adapts perfectly to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras.
Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash.
Larger DSLR cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2 still have room for more lenses.
Additionally, you can store all kinds of accessories.
And those who have a small mirrorless camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photography-related items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history
In the barely three months since the outbreak began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight?
With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data available on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in the past few days, but volcanologists are not making any predictions about when it will end.
The indicators point to a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE.
Damages in the millions
In the barely three months since the outbreak began, the more than 1,000-degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE.
Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a layer of lava one meter thick.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land masses were formed by cooled lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares.
Particularly affected was the banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants live directly or indirectly, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were heavily affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and gifts
Christmas is at the door and especially the children are eagerly looking forward to the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something tempting about them.
Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still unite our increasingly divided society.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-promoting "social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition.
How Nikolaus became the Christkind  (Note: "Christkind" is a term used in German-speaking countries to refer to the baby Jesus.)
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated the Christmas holidays closely with gift-giving.
On St. Nicholas Day, gifts were offered in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom today is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin.
From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German tradition emerged of filling children's shoes, especially those of the children, with gifts.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "saint worship".
For these reasons, they protect themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition.
The focus of the gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so strictly, it only irritates a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period.
Today, one can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree and at the door in boots.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources confirm a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
In all Christian-influenced countries, however, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who is essentially a kind of St. Nicholas, has been assigned some peculiarities over time.
This includes, for example, his white mustache, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sled, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, Father Frost gained some fame.
Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses pulling the sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handover of gifts.

Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near the King's Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot and killed by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookmaker's business.
According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was later stopped by officials.
There have been shots fired, and the man has been hit.
He was declared dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not assume a terrorist background.
In the area around the Kensington Palace, several embassies are located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area, or stone garden.
The lamp can be easily set up and anchored in the ground with 2 ground spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery.
Maximum duration of light: 10 hours.
The robust plastic execution is suitable for outdoor use all year round.
In Hollywood spectacles, it is mostly threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from within.
In contrast, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in a total of six different color tones).
The borderless, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden.
He does well in the neighborhood of larger gravel and boulders, where he is able to assert himself due to his size.
You can save big on preliminary work: "Smart Stone" does not require wiring or batteries as a solar light.
Place the "Lightstone" on any sunlit spot during the day.
Two delivered earth spikes provide a firm grip when needed.
The matte white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light.
The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
At dusk, "Smart Stone" starts to glow autonomously; in which color, you decide: You have a choice of six attractive light colors, in addition to daylight white.
Also, the shutdown eventually occurs automatically when the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or it gets brighter again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day.
I have already done that several times, but it doesn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to place another order with you, but if the discount is not credited to me, I will not place another order out of principle.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again.
A variable, adjustable PWM frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super-silent operation, especially in bell armature motors - the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs.
The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough power for older motors.

Pill problem
Hello dear female population,
I hope I'm doing this correctly. Is this actually my first post after a year on Reddit?
To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pains and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) before my period.
I would like to keep this now, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose.
My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an approximately two-year break and suddenly, explosively, I got acne from 0 to 100 and it was everywhere.
As far as it is superficial, but it has burdened me quite a bit and I did not feel well.
In the two-year pause, the whole thing has never really normalized.
Perhaps someone has some tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and silicone-free, but maybe someone can recommend something to me.
Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel!
Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis before puberty, then a period of rest, then widespread knotty skin and acne.
I have also tried everything possible in terms of nutrition during my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar, milk, and meat-free mixed diet because nothing else has worked so well.
It can also be good that the worm is simply hormonal, but when you want to have a construction site everywhere, like me, you also want to stop searching for what else might be going wrong.
I had already seen everything of her colleague's seminars, etc.
Written and now I've lost the conversation and don't know what was answered about my concern.
I always have to work and answer the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What would there be to check if the money were there, I would have seen it.
Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.
but he is generally available in large quantities
because it is available in large print in black  (Note: I couldn't translate the last word of the sentence as it was not specified in the original text.)

In the name of the people: Laypeople pass judgments
In the courtroom, they sit on the judge's bench in everyday clothing.
But a lot depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear robes: jurors, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes to prison.
Two of them report in conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately I am unable to access the customer account.
Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material?
We don't have the means to preserve this for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
Sure, I'd be happy to help. Here's the translation:  "Gerne, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful now, I would like to order one in gray."
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for pickup and return?
And when would be the pickup?
110 kV underground cable to be built new in 2022
The approval for the relocation of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The decision on the planning permission by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the transformer substation Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen.
The cable is connected near the village of Edermanning to a mast of the overhead line near Reut.
Good morning,
My order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially at our place so far.
The blue betsell number #PRS\_ORG# with the order number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me what the next step is?
A beautiful start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained it several times yesterday!
This is a glass commode, and all the sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken.
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS\_ORG# regulations.
This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message
But why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Subject: Lesson Planning (EK)
Hello dear colleagues,
I have been teaching at the Ref since the summer, and teaching is fun for me. However, I currently have major problems with time-efficiently planning my geography lessons.
Unfortunately, my school is not at all well-equipped technically, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media.
In school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography).
I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
We are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself.
In principle, the methods also repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I always start with the learning goal when planning (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have).
We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the exercises in the book.
Therefore also the work sheets.
Perhaps a geography teacher can help me with how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really enjoy it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#.
I have actually already decided to join #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the returns as quickly as possible.
The trade fears due to the 2G regulation for the Christmas business.
Most businesses now only allow entry to those who are vaccinated or have recovered.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and laments revenue declines.
A possible solution is also ready.
The 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas business for the retail industry, according to the German Retail Association (HDE).
Complaining about sales declines for articles of non-daily need, HDE chief executive officer Stefan Genth criticized.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies look negatively at the remaining days of the year.
Many would have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth.
Traders with 2G access restrictions lost accordingly in the past week almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover.
It runs well only in the food retail trade and in the online area.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO.
"2G shopping doesn't advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations deterred customers and required a high personnel effort.
The text can be translated to English as follows:  "He demanded that the bandage regulation be approved nationwide."
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all businesses with the received booklet on the same day.
In addition, in retail - as already in public transport with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered or tested) - random checks should be sufficient.
Even the real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, spoke of difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last at around 75% of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the turnover was at around 90%.
These numbers will now fall securely in the middle of such an important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche".
Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a hotel club, can enter all stores unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
This looks ugly.
I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged it and sealed it back up.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction.
For the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of it.
In addition to the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very high luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker.
The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas with relatively small distance is excellent.
Incidentally, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on set or in the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery)
User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To execute the settings for individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time.
The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with the battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it allows for the use of cost-effective NP-F batteries.
These are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can check the batteries' power output before the set as well - it has a built-in battery tester. For each of the two battery compartments, there is a value displayed in the two display screens (the left battery on the upper display, the right on the lower display).
In addition, it is naturally possible to continuously supply the lamp with current through the included power supply.
The construction of the headlight is very simple.
You have a 16mm threaded sleeve for securing, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably set using indicators on both sides.
It was taken into account that the mechanical components are also of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a ball joint is included in the delivery scope.
It is magnificent that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small 🙁
"Party, which we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a lot in a comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row without a win, Hesse seemed to be on their way to the next league defeat.
But then the SGE turned it on, got rid of the frustration from a mediocre start to the season within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and gave a "general praise" to "everyone who was involved."
It initially looked like another setback for the Frankfurt team, who were still lagging behind expectations in ninth place.
Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2:0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach.
"As the players returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am absolutely thrilled with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result.
Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcoming his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, looking at the result with pleasure, especially for the spectators.
That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also feels well-prepared in terms of the personnel situation.
It is extraordinary that we all players are fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle.
Now one wants to "go step by step and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up, on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) scheduled.
I will receive the email that my package is returned to you due to an error on my part.
I have tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and redirect it, no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and place the order again?
It would unfortunately mean for me that I won't be ordering again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Muffler for women's handball team before quarterfinals against Spain
Germany's women's handball team slinked off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the main round of the World Cup, the German national team suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals.
"We were too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent," judged national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we must act differently.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second behind the Danish women (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us.
"That was a bad game that we have to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, there must be a clear improvement against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup on the coming Tuesday, in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
Best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion from Denmark was Alina Grijseels, a backcourt player, with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now."
Not up to standard from front to back
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top of their game from the start.
Mistakes and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only foreman Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades.
The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this, however.
Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women barely managed to make an appearance - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team's goal.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since midfielder Mia Zschocke saw red shortly after a hard foul on her opponent.
In the quarterfinals, she is allowed to participate again.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the German national team come into the game better and at least reach five goals by halftime.
The already faint hope of a comeback after the break was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the protégés of the Greens sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who counts among the medal contenders at the final round.
As a result, the German team was unable to rally for a performance improvement and left the court as a clear loser.

As with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers
Does that work for you?
The title exists, I am working as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes.
Since these will soon be largely completed, it will then continue in part at vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without any time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal in nature (e.g. "I am taking medication X, will it interfere with the vaccination?").
Within my area of responsibility falls the education for vaccination, the indication (a person has a claim to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and if necessary, the emergency care for allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical staff.
In vaccination teams, we often don't have nurses present, but rather (thankfully) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for preparing the vaccine, who cannot (are not allowed to?) administer vaccinations, so I also have to perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution
What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect speech, sent by someone from Amberg, has caused intense reflection in the BR television program "We in Bavaria".
But unlike on many previous days, the term remained unmentioned in the "Host mi?" series by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "nervous person".
And no one, "to whom everything must go quickly".
That, heard the people from the TV moderator, is completely wrong.
The solution was communicated by the man from Amberg, which probably also caused surprise for many people in the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a cloth with which someone wipes the oven".
Dialect researcher Anthony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typically Upper Palatine term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern".
What an educational gap was closed - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy books for 2 weeks.
After confirmation, the following error message always appears: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# device, connected it to the computer, synchronized and repaired it.
Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures?
This morning, I woke up full of motivation to do something, because I wanted to prepare for my upcoming bicycle tour at least a little bit.
Said, done, and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were really nice - but then something happened that lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you, Krefeld!).
Glass splinters on the track.
Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the journey in any way.
Since I couldn't get a replacement sleeve and hose on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around half-heartedly and take the first available train back home.
Then the lawn mower was not quite as bad technically, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I am faced with a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would extremely dislike to encounter this problem frequently.
Now it wasn't really bad, since there were also the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who on the day I picked up the bike had ridden 120km by 12pm). He had already described them as suboptimal, as he had been riding on them for several years.
But when I think about it, that I still have to make a tire change after driving for 80-90 km, then I am, I think, really in a bad mood :D
Now I have struck up a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be indestructible.
Now it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really indestructible?
I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end.
I am also asking myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment.
There are also (apparently?) wider tires in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you recommend me to other tires for a racing bike in general?
The Swallow-side seems to be tailored to my absolute! My layman's knowledge would rather recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!

Hello to all,
Finally, we can announce that we will be organizing the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio for obvious reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement.
BUT: There will be at least three people per shift, so we will be streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems.
But hey, it's still pandemic – nevertheless, we will do our best to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30.
Have you ever chilled drinks, planned good food, and gotten ready for a long but very interesting night?
