Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again

ASSISTANT: 格巴的双重停电解释及其可能再次发生的原因
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

ASSISTANT: Gabba的广播设施设置中存在的电力故障风险，不太可能在下一次亚洲杯之前得到改善，因为板球当局等待着更多关于该球场主要升级计划的细节，以便承办2032年奥运会。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world.

ASSISTANT: 据《墨西哥时报》和《悉尼观察报》报道，Gabba是澳大利亚唯一一个主要体育场，其场内的主要电力供应不足以启动全球传播所需的广泛广播车和设备。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

ASSISTANT: 第四天，全球广播比赛的主要和备用发电机约25分钟停机。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself.

ASSISTANT: 这是因为在该区域的基础电力需要供应加巴的灯塔之一 - 其中著名的一个在2019年的Big Bash League比赛中停电 - 以及球场本身的电力需求。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 因此，广播公司主要从一台大型、使用柴油发电的发电机获得电力，备用电力来自备用发电机。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes.

ASSISTANT: 然而，在测试赛事的第四天，主发电机和备用发电机的故障导致两者同时停止工作，导致近30分钟的全部或部分广播图像和DRS的丢失。

ASSISTANT: NEP公司，负责为Fox和Seven提供外部直播车和其他设施，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up.

ASSISTANT: 所有其他用于阿什斯碗比赛的场地 - 阿德莱德球场、墨尔本球场、悉尼球场和霍巴特球场 - 将提供主线电力作为广播商的主要供应，留下柴油发电机作为备用。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

ASSISTANT: 这种差异过去曾经给主播公司Fox Cricket带来了很大的焦虑，而在亚希斯测试期间，由于生产和技术人员的极大减少，无法密切关注各种象征性的球在比赛中被保持在空中的情况，使得这种差异变得更加严重。

Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.
