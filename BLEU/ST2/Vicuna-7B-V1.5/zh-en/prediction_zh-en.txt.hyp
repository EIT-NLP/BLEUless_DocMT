I think it's a very meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate is one of the skills certificates that I think is important besides my driver's license!
Promotion: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken when an unexpected event occurs, which is the rescue before the ambulance arrives. As everyone knows, there is still a period of time after the accident occurs until the ambulance arrives, and it is precisely during this period that is the most critical.
At this time, it is the time for emergency. If I really have heart disease, brain hemorrhage, and respiratory arrest, then our window of life only has four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important for people around us to know first aid! When someone falls down near us, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them instead of just standing there doing nothing, which is too helpless and terrifying.
In China, official data shows that there are 300,000 people who die from accidents every year. The most dangerous one is sudden heart failure. In the United States, the survival rate is only 15% on average.
In the casino hotels in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved. Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%. This is what the founder of the first reaction, Liu Lei, said.
If a person has a heart attack and stops breathing and has no pulse, performing CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) by compressing the chest and providing artificial respiration can potentially save their life.
I have found that few people nowadays have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation occurs, it is too late to learn. Therefore, I still urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations. Who knows, it may even save a life!
Emergency First Aid certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center. I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai. Students also receive discounts. PS: The last picture is a record of the goal I set for myself 25 years ago, which was to complete the Emergency First Aid certification. Adding the Emergency First Aid certification to my goal list was a few months ago, but I have indeed completed it!
After that, I plan to take other certifications that I want to take, such as the diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is a diving emergency certification, and it seems that you need to have the emergency certification to take the diving certification. So actually, the emergency certification is still very useful!

Chongqing Municipal Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system. Starting from this year, 60 vocational schools in our city will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" for talent cultivation, and students who participate in the pilot will have the status of both apprentices and students. After being admitted, they will be pre-recruited by the pilot enterprises as employees.
The local education authority requires vocational schools to standardize the recruitment and training of apprentices and corporate trainees, clearly defining the dual identity of apprentices as students of vocational schools and corporate trainees, and adopting a mutual selection principle. Apprentices, schools, and enterprises shall sign a tripartite agreement, and for apprentices who have turned 16 but have not yet turned 18, the agreement must be signed by the apprentice, their guardian, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement shall determine the rights and interests of each party and specify the specific job, teaching content, and benefits guaranteed to the apprentice during on-the-job training. It is encouraged for pilot schools to adopt a modern apprenticeship system and jointly carry out enterprise employee training and job transfer training with cooperative enterprises.
Trial schools need to reform their talent cultivation mode. The school and enterprise should jointly design a talent cultivation plan, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The trial period is set as an experimental period for cultivating the curriculum, and the duration of the internship for students in the enterprise is determined according to the professional talent cultivation plan. Generally, the top internship lasts for 6 months. In the enterprise practice, the enterprise team-based management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, one teacher can guide 2-5 students, forming a learning group to ensure that students master the skills required for each training position in each round of training.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city will determine 60 municipal-level modern apprenticeship trial points, with each trial point having about 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) will be trained. On the basis of the first trial, it will be gradually promoted from point to surface, exploring the establishment of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated cultivation of talents, and striving to effectively improve the skills of students and increase their employment rate and job quality.

This vacuum cleaner has been considered for a long time, and finally made a decisive move. The suction effect is not bad, and there is obviously less dust in the house. However, it is a bit heavy to hold with one hand; the wet wipe needs to be improved, and there will be dust residue when pulling it back and forth; overall, it is still a very satisfied cooking machine with a bit of weight. Looking up at it, it is suitable for my small kitchen, and my child says it tastes better than what I cook myself. I have made two dishes of stir-fry and braised dishes, and the braised pork with sugar and vinegar is particularly delicious. It takes a long time, and other cooking times are very short. The noise is very small, and there is no need to worry about making a mess, nor is there any need to worry about not being able to cook!

I have added a new member to my kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machine, automatically controlling the heat and automatically stir-frying. No longer afraid of being burned by hot oil, no longer afraid of inadequate heat control causing the food to be overcooked or undercooked.
The stir-fried dishes tasted better than what I made, and the stir-fried tomatoes and eggs were particularly delicious. The texture of the fried eggs was also very good. This wok is definitely worth buying.
The product is great, worth buying, and the overall quality is excellent. It is very clear and consistent with the description.
Worth having. Customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and doesn't strain the eyes. I haven't found any other abnormalities except that it's thicker than the current mainstream displays. The bezel is also wider, and the gap between the bezel and the screen is a bit large. However, the display effect is not bad, and the accessories are complete.
The logistics speed is fast! The merchant's service attitude is good!
After using it for a while, the quality is good, and the screen resolution is also very clear. The stock trading is great, with a ratio of 1:4, it's too perfect.
The logistics are fast, the goods are good, buying a second one is definitely a good deal. The display screen has high quality, and it's not because the screen is large that it loses its clarity.

A South African doctor: Although the Omikron variant has a strong transmission power, it mainly infects patients with mild symptoms. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omikron variant of the novel coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant. Although the transmission speed of the Omikron variant is faster, it mainly infects patients with mild symptoms.
According to a report by the US media, as the omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in the KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The organization's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pili said: "They can control their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said that this includes elderly patients and patients with health problems, who are usually more likely to develop severe illness due to the novel coronavirus.
He said, compared to the previous wave of the Delta variant of COVID-19, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing and low blood oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days."
In the two weeks following the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors have shared similar experiences. Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks, the doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa: Among recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% were severe cases, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave; the average length of hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; in recent cases, only 3% have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak cases in South Africa was 20%. Dr. William Hanekom, director of the Africa Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a mild disease."
He also said: "Now is still the early stage, we need to obtain post-epidemic data. Usually, the time of hospitalization and death occurs later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods. Although Delta is still the main variant of COVID-19 globally, Omicron cases have been reported in several countries, with South Africa serving as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases of COVID-19 in the Dominican Republic increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests have shown that more than 90% of the cases are caused by the Omicron variant.

Yang Haitao spoke at the barrier mountain, proclaiming the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress, drawing inspiration from the century-long struggle of the party.
According to a report by Hunan Daily on December 10th (reporter Chen Baowei), based on a unified arrangement by the provincial committee, provincial committee member and propaganda department director Yang Hao East gave an interactive lecture at the video creative park in Mawan Mountain in the morning of December 10th to deeply study and implement the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Party, the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and instructions on Lake South, and the spirit of the 12th Provincial Party Congress. Yang Hao East discussed the three aspects of ideal belief and original mission, self-revolution and youth of the Party, and Party leadership and theory from his own insights and experiences, and systematically and comprehensively expounded the core meaning and practical requirements of the spirit of the 19th National Congress.
He pointed out that it is important to combine the spirit of the whole meeting and the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congress, and to study and integrate them, so as to enhance the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two safeguards", and unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping. During the interactive exchange session, grassroots party branch representatives, business representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three major historical resolutions, the decisive significance of "two establishments", how cultural enterprises can seize the initiative, and how new generations of party members can draw strength from the century-long history of the party, among other topics. Yang Huaide responded to their questions with plain language and vivid examples, urging young party members to draw strength from the century-long struggle of the party and tighten their bonds around the central leadership of the party, unswervingly follow the party central committee, and use their youth to fulfill their responsibilities

Actually, I don't know if it's because the store made a mistake or because the rider didn't put the receipt in the delivery bag.
"追查不了希望你们了解一下" can be translated to "I hope you understand."
"Because the delivery time was faster than displayed by 30 minutes, thank you."
Yes, I have already changed to a new rider and he has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has always said that it takes a few hours to process the order.
I have taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is constantly being delayed.
"原来要 #NUMBER# 那总之我不叫了" can be translated to "I didn't call it #NUMBER# originally."
"If I don't eat anymore, I will complain."
"你送不到，怎么不早点讲啊等你那么久" can be translated to "Why didn't you send it earlier? How long have you been waiting?"
"No, I haven't received the call. Please notify them and have them send it to our company."
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes.
"A meal has been waiting for half an hour #PRS\_ORG# has not been sent yet."
I want to cancel the order, why can't I cancel it?
Hello, the fried chicken sent from the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a coach with a similar price first. It's not friendly, and in fact, the price often corresponds to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive coaching will seem more friendly than cheap coaching, and this type of "entry-level coaching" is actually industrial waste.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is huge. Even with a hard ball, it's hard for top players to control it. The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll make a cheap and nasty one that you can use twice and then give up on it. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.
Wait until you can truly distinguish between good and bad, indicating your progress, and then come back to buy my expensive ones. I'll make two times the money. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money on a second-hand camera that's a bit better, choose between Prince or Tuellup. These two brands don't have much reputation, so good cameras don't sell for a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good, a second-hand one for 200. Don't you think it's enjoyable to have a camera worth a thousand dollars?
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once they pass the newcomer stage, they become arrogant. However, most people, especially girls, cannot pass the newcomer stage.
May I ask for your help in following up on my order which has been delayed multiple times for delivery?
Thank you for the delay.
"Just to say, in fact, I already have credit?"
May I ask if I need to reorder next? Should I ignore the previous order?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but when it was delivered, it was missing a lot of ingredients, and the chicken was raw.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency, the Jiangxi Province in China plans to train 10,000 rural primary school teachers in music, art, and sports within the next three years to ensure the balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas. Starting from 2016, Jiangxi Province will allocate three years to train one music, art, and sports teacher for each rural primary school in the province, a total of 10,000 teachers.
According to the understanding, the training objects are rural primary school teachers in Jiangxi Province who are 45 years old or younger and have music, art, or physical education knowledge or skills, and can teach other subjects besides music, art, and physical education. Through the training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, learn modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus cultural ability, and self-development ability, build a team of multi-skilled music and art teachers, and alleviate the problem of insufficient number of music and art teachers in rural areas.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi plans to provide 100 counties (cities, districts) with one trainer each in music, art, and sports, a total of 300 trainers, and comprehensively enhance their teaching demonstration leadership ability, teaching research activity organization ability, teaching ability, and network training workshop construction ability, playing the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
Because waiting for another 20 minutes would have already waited for an hour #NUMBER# of minutes.
I don't want the food that I made 1 hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous order that I made a mistake on, but I can't find my tire.
Hello，how long will it take for the ordered food to be delivered?
Your travel companion's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
Excuse me, can you give me a reasonable explanation? But your co-pilot has a lot of problems, please handle it well.
Can you check if they are still on the way? If so, it would be best to send them directly. If they are not, please return the deposit for the reservation.
In fact, there are many discussions about what clothes to wear for girls with a slim body. Girls with a fat body should not wear skirts that are too short or too long. The length difference should be just right above the knee, and it should be able to cover the fat thighs.
The length of the skirt is too short, which will expose the fat on the thighs. If it is too long, it will give people a short and fat feeling.
If you wear clothes that are split into upper, middle, and lower sections, it will make you appear taller, and this is achieved by using different colors for the top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt. This will give the impression of a slimming effect. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard issue for chubby girls (a point that the author feels deeply), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat. High-class and elegant black shorts are also the first choice for chubby girls.
Wearing deep-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make you look thinner. If your legs are fat, don't wear your socks and shoes too noticeably.
The more people like it, the better it is. The color should not be too bright either. Otherwise, people may pay more attention to your legs and feet, giving you a feeling of being overweight.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to teach them how to dress appropriately. Do not let overweight girls wear tight short skirts. Also, do not wear tops that are too short or stuffed inside the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear a black long-sleeved t-shirt or a mesh t-shirt (with a fine grid pattern, please). Choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match it with a shirt with a ruffled collar. This can effectively cover the shortcomings of overweight girls.
Of course, overweight girls can also dress up in short skirts. When an overweight girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make her appear taller.
Short skirt paired with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look even more slender, this is the hottest summer match-up, right? If you are an MM who is heavy on top but skinny on the bottom, I recommend choosing a beautifully designed tunic-style short skirt.
Not only can it hide your big belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. A short skirt with the letter "A" can be very slimming, which is particularly suitable for girls with a bit of extra weight. When choosing a top, it's best to opt for something that's a bit form-fitting, as this will create a slimming effect and make you look even more slender.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  Wear a simple and white T-shirt with a short skirt. Even MM can try it. Thin girls can also try to create a stylish look.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing, even overweight girls will become the focus of everyone's attention. After making changes in dressing, it is also important to exercise more in life and strive to escape the label of being overweight earlier in the day 😄

Heat dissipation effect: Good Thinness degree: Convenient Appearance material: Satisfactory Huawei has always been known for its high cost-performance ratio. The new machine is excellent.

The price of Hikari's Shadow Knight Dragon is not considered expensive. Personally, I think Hikari's Shadow Knight Dragon is great. Game effect: The game effect is refreshing, and I can play most games smoothly. My chicken is all high-frame rate and stable, which is very smooth.

The red on the butt is a very good wine color, not too flashy, and the overall impression is higher than expected. It's a great value purchase and suitable for girls. Two years ago, I started using the HP Omen 15-inch laptop, which I've been using for two years. The price-to-performance ratio is high, and the quality is excellent!
Friends around me also recommended that they buy this product! I have already bought three machines from this series!
The exterior looks beautiful and it's well-configured, making it a great gift for the grandkids. Initially, I was planning to wait for the 418 banking event, but since he needed it urgently, I decided to buy it early. Unfortunately, I missed out on the big banking event.
"But the price-performance ratio is very high, logistics is also very fast. Let's wait for a while and review the whole new original package, which has a very high price-performance ratio. It's a game notebook with a very good design style, and it's already installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019."

Why is there only one shrimp dumpling order, but there are six copies of the chopstick order?
"我不会去，我是按送单。"  (Note: This is a direct translation of the Chinese text, which may not convey the exact meaning in English. A more accurate translation would depend on the context in which the sentence is used.)
"这 1 个小时从没有人联系我，这根本是网上诈骗你以为我第一次叫外卖？"
After the investigation, you are also saying this! Before I placed the order, I checked the address several times to ensure that it was correct. Thank you! How many days is it?
From 7:00 AM to now, 9:30 AM, the order has not been sent yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
The so-called "new mountain area" boasts the loudest exhaust sound! This time, our team brought this car to you, which is many men's dream!
It is the flagship sports car of Lamborghini, the replacement model of Murcielago - Aventador LP700-4! With a price tag of almost two hundred thousand dollars, the annual road tax is several thousand dollars, it is four-wheel drive, why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, you can imagine how fast it is, right? I don't even know the data, but it says that the 0-100km/h acceleration only takes 2.9 seconds. That's basically when my friend's Myvi reaches 30km/h, their car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low profile of the car body, the flamboyant scissor doors, the huge air intakes all around the car, and the 6.5 V12 engine that can be seen through the glass all perfectly interpreted the style of Lamborghini. For the description of the car model, it is not necessary to say too much. Just Google it and you will find all the information you need. As an editor, I have summarized some explanations that Google may not have provided.
The text you provided is in Chinese. Here's the English translation:  "太过备受瞩目，去到哪里大家都在看，很不自在！(其实有点爽)1km油钱在RM1左右 (车主根本不care)"  Here's the breakdown of the translation:  * "太过备受瞩目" means "too eye-catching" or "attracting too much attention." * "去到哪里大家都在看" means "wherever you go, everyone is watching." * "很不自在" means "very uncomfortable" or "inconvenient." * "其实有点爽" means "actually, it's quite refreshing" or "it's quite invigorating." * "1km油钱在RM1左右" means "1km costs around RM1." * "车主根本不care"
Practice your posture when getting in and out of the car, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because you won't be able to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud, and you will suddenly feel dizzy after getting out of the car. (But it's still very refreshing.)
The car is too big to fit in a regular parking space, so it's very narrow. I'm afraid of getting hit by the doors of the cars on either side when they open! It's a bit lonely because there are no other cars on the road (I'm talking about myself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Please don't misunderstand, the super-running in this video is not for sale. Sorry! If you are a friend who wants to shoot a video for your beloved car, please feel free to contact us!
For more car information that you may not know, it's all in The Car Guide / People's Car Chronicle, where a car accident with a value of millions of dollars is entangled!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of the Porsche 911 is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, several high-end sports cars, including a Porsche 911 and a Bugatti Chiron, were destroyed in a collision abroad in just a few minutes.

The president of Iran said that if the United States lifts sanctions against Iran, it will be possible to reach a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue through negotiations.  The president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, said on December 11 in Tehran that if the United States lifts sanctions against Iran, it will be possible to reach a "good agreement" on the Iranian nuclear issue through negotiations.
According to the message released on the website of the Iranian president, Rouhani said during his meeting with the ambassadors of the neighboring countries that Iran has proven its sincerity in negotiations by submitting proposals to the other parties to the nuclear agreement.

Yes, the order is in the acceptance state, but the restaurant called and said that they cannot deliver the bones because the driver does not have the ability to transport them. Therefore, the restaurant needs to cut the meat and bones apart, and discard the bones.
Do you understand that my problem is not with order delays?
Or you can directly call me to ask if I am following up?
The maximum length of a university student's leave of absence for entrepreneurship in Guangxi can reach up to 5 years. According to a report from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department, starting from the next academic year, all universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, which will allow students to extend their leave of absence for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years, based on their original academic system. The time spent on leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be considered as practical education time. (Source: Xinhua, May 19, 2023)
To promote the enhancement of entrepreneurial and innovative abilities among university students, departments such as education and human resources in Guangxi have joined forces to build an entrepreneurship platform. They are constructing more college-based practical teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external support for university students' entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2020, the total area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in each university should reach 3,000 square meters or more for undergraduate schools and 2,000 square meters or more for vocational schools.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship credits, and prioritizes the conversion of outstanding students who excel in innovation and entrepreneurship practice. University teachers are required to have at least two months of internship in the industry every two years to enhance their awareness and capabilities in teaching innovation and entrepreneurship.
The Autonomous Region Education Department requires all universities in Guangxi to thoroughly implement the plan for training university students in innovation and entrepreneurship, and strive to ensure that every university student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their college years. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

The Visual Wedding Photography Base (Stores in Hebei) currently does not have a branch specializing in wedding photography fashion, makeup artists are also top-notch, the shooting techniques and angles are called professional, and the shooting effect is very good.
The seller is highly reputable and has a good service attitude. The makeup is very elegant, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very enjoyable, and the professional team provided excellent service. The seller's service attitude was also very good, and I would recommend it to my friends. I am very satisfied.
Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, for allowing me to have a unique wedding photo. Thank you to everyone who worked on the wedding photo today, and I look forward to seeing the final product.
Taking wedding photos is basically a physical activity, especially for photographers who have to run and jump around. The makeup artist was very attentive and helped me design a makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer captured the mood with his humor and wit, making it worth praising.
Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist. I hope to still be able to see myself looking this beautiful when I am alive. Praise the women, their eyes are beautiful, their figures are tall and slender, and they look like wise wives and good mothers who take care of their families in the future.
The groom is said to have won, a lifetime of happiness, and beauty. The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what is said online, my husband and I look very handsome and beautiful in the photos we took together, and we are very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude is also very enthusiastic. This time, not only did we appreciate the beautiful scenery, but we also took beautiful wedding photos and met a good friend, the photographer.
The wedding photo is so beautiful, it blew up the photographer and makeup artist. You guys are really super professional. I really appreciate Mu sister's patience and meticulous guidance, and the photos she took are really great~
When I saw the wedding photo, I suddenly realized that it was myself in the photo. As long as the photographer chooses a good angle, you can also have a wedding photo that is comparable to that of a celebrity.
The importance of taking wedding photos cannot be overstated, as both the photographer and makeup artist have a keen eye for aesthetics. Fortunately, I was able to find someone who shared my vision. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "photogenic."
A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23rd, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Princeton University, and Yale University - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the trial. The organization's chairman, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission criteria of top US universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three top US universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities, in the so-called "holistic consideration" admission process, "systematically and persistently discriminate against Asian applicants." Zhao Yuxuan introduced that in 2014, Sanders et al.'s research showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian students were admitted at the lowest rate among all ethnic groups.
The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that he hoped that after submitting the lawsuit, the US Department of Education and the Justice Department would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian applicants in their admissions.
They also hope that the universities they have reported can proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians. Currently, the three universities that have been reported have not made any responses.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept the complaint on procedural grounds. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the complaint, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education organizations that participated in the petition.
The following text is in Chinese:  需要餐具刚刚取消了订单  And the English translation is:  "Need utensils just canceled an order."
Why can I still execute it and can you help me check if it can be cancelled?
"But I placed the order at 5:09 this morning."
On the other side is the reservation hotline. They say they don't know if there is a phone that can directly contact them.
In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory building located in Shaojing Town, Yiwu City, Zhejiang Province from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory building. In December 2020, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan through a bank transfer on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Building Sale and Purchase Agreement" as the payee. It was stipulated in the agreement that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer. The agreement also stipulated that both parties should sign the factory building sale and purchase agreement within one week. However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the sales range and payment methods, the signing of the factory building sale and purchase agreement was delayed.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu. After a long search, Mr. Liu finally found a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu feel helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Liu sued Mr. Lin to the Yueyang City People's Court. The court after investigation found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and it was not reasonable to blame only the defendant. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double return of deposit, and the defendant does not need to assume the breach of contract liability of returning the deposit twice.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.
Lawyer's Reminder: In the trading process, it is necessary to exercise caution and prudence. As the buyer, you should exercise caution and prudence when signing a contract, such as verifying the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the delivery time and location in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.
"Good, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address."
Jichang Restaurant (Wufangkou Store)[Mint] Environment: Medium-sized, orderly [Bell] Service: Quick service "Ancient Method Mala Jiaozi" is my must-try dish. The mala jiaozi is too fragrant, too soft, and too delicious 😋 If you like sweet food, you must try "Dongjiang Ink Fish Slippery Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh, the tofu is very tender, and the ink...
The taste is praised, the meat is delicious, and the service is warm and enthusiastic. It's been a long time since I last came here. The fruit juice is still as good to drink, and the ingredients are real and authentic. When I first tried the spicy beef rolls, it was the southern flavor of the soft and crispy bread crumbs that I loved!
The steamed rice and fried rice are just right in terms of texture, with a generous portion size. The signature Siyi paper-wrapped chicken wings are just as delicious as ever, and the example soup is also quite good. The processing of the bok choy is also quite... delicious. The taste is praised, the service is warm and enthusiastic, and the meat dishes are also very good.
"Ji Chang Old Store" used to be a popular presence on the internet a long time ago. It was located in a small courtyard on East Single Street, with wooden floors and walls. People had to wait a long time to eat the steamed rice bowls at the entrance, and the sand pots used for the steamed rice bowls were all cracked...
For several years, I haven't gone to eat at Jiangchang restaurant. With the rise of various small shops selling Guangdong cuisine, the customer flow has been dispersed. It's hard to find a seat when you finally go there, and the quality of the food is just as good as before.
The taste is praised, the meat is delicious, and the main dish is praised. The outside delivery is also praised.
Rice dish: This meal was slightly disappointing. Three cups of chicken: The side dishes were a bit too much, and the chicken meat was slightly lacking.
The taste that is mainly adjusted has a slight deviation, the base flavor is not salty enough, which highlights the sweetness, and everyone can think about adding sweetness and various spices to the dish.
What is the drinking method for red label whiskey? Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like to collect, some people like to eat, of course, there are also people who like to drink. Red label whiskey is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in all countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine and Spirit Competition.
Each bottle of red-labeled whiskey has its own unique flavor. However, if you don't know how to taste it, wouldn't you be wasting its rich aroma? Then, how should red-labeled whiskey be drunk?
Here's the translation from Chinese to English:  小编为大家简单介绍下。红牌威士忌喝法：  This is a simple introduction by the editor for everyone. The drinking method of red label whiskey:
Tony Nguyen's red label whiskey is made from about 35 types of Scottish whiskey, with a rich and fragrant aroma and the characteristics of traditional Scottish whiskey. The fragrance is sweet and smoky, with a hint of vanilla. The taste is fresh and clean, with a slight aroma of grass and a strong flavor of smoked barley.
This whiskey can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with your favorite drink. When the red-labeled whiskey entered the domestic market, it was designed to suit the taste of the Chinese people. Therefore, red-labeled whiskey mixed with Coca-Cola, Sprite, or New Coke, etc., has become a fashionable and long-lasting drink.
These sweet drinks not only have the ability to neutralize acidity, but they can also bring visual pleasure and add a pleasant taste to the drink. When added to the drink, they can produce a refreshing taste and change the taste of the drink. The traditional and most authentic way to drink red-labeled whiskey is with a slice of lemon, a cube of sugar (sand sugar can also be used), and a straw.
The traditional red label whiskey has a slightly sour taste, which can be neutralized by adding sugar. Lemon can also bring a refreshing aroma to the wine, of course, the sweet-sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. The above three are the best way to drink red labeled whiskey, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
If you cannot change the location of the store for me, can you consider delivering instead?
So I don't need to give him any more money, right?
The order of my colleague has already been sent and I can't seem to finish it.
What about GPS? Do you have it or not?
The bride and groom's wedding photoshoot (South Street store) has not yet been scheduled. Before the photoshoot, we had to change the time twice because our schedules were not arranged properly. The consultant, Ms. Lan Lan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to shoot. The staff of the Golden Family, including consultants, makeup artists, and photographers, were all highly praised.
That was my first time officially putting on makeup. Wow, I couldn't believe it. I thought I would never look that good. Haha. Jie Jie and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) were very patient when putting on makeup, and it looked very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Xiangzhou City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel too cold. When taking photos, the makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and accessories from time to time and would immediately help us tidy up if there was anything slightly out of place. The photographer was also very funny and seemed to be in a good mood all day while taking photos.
When taking photos, I didn't want to let the customers take too many photos because I saw many cases online, but when we took the photos, we didn't add any extra photos. We just took the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin, who took my wedding dress photos, added over a thousand extra photos to her seven-thousand-plus package. I was shocked at the time and also afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos were edited and sent to me. I looked at them and found two that I didn't like. They immediately helped me re-edit them.
Compare the photos of my little sister that were taken before, and I think our photos are really satisfying, simple and fresh, just the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xianyang Jin Fu Ren to take wedding photos!
Package price: 3999 yuan. Wife sincerely wishes that you will be happy and prosperous, with a bright future ahead of you.
How much is this set?
What conditions must the $32 satisfy in order to be used?

Your name is Zhang Ming, and this is your second week in Japan. You were walking on the street when suddenly someone was following you. You were scared and ran away as fast as you could.
The person behind you calls out, "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese dialogue) You stop your feet at the convenience store entrance. "Miss... I'm a director. I think you look very beautiful. Would you be interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very confused and afraid that this is a scam. He gave you a business card, and you found out that he was a director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The salary will definitely not be cheap." You blushed and agreed to come to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street and was very happy to invite you.
You thought there would be no loss, and you could still make money, so you signed the contract. This is a large-scale romantic reality show, divided into two parts.
In the early stage, celebrities and amateurs will interact in real life, fostering mutual understanding. Later on, they will enter the game together to overcome challenges.
Starting next week, the formal recording will begin. You don't know who your partner will be and what interesting things will happen, right?
So, can the system see the new order and how will it handle the rider?
I think I can't accept orders with a delay of more than 20 minutes, as none of them have been sent yet.
In Sabah, 3,200 newborn babies have not received their birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the lack of anti-forgery paper, and the number of affected individuals has reached 3,200 to date.
However, the head of the immigration office, Kazuo Aminu, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system. He said that when anti-forgery paper arrives next week, the missing certificates will be reissued. Aminu made the statement at a press conference in response to a net media report that the birth certificate printing problem in Sabah had lasted for over 10 months.
He said that the problem appeared two months ago, and Sarawak is also facing the same problem. "One of the reasons is that a Chinese factory that produces special anti-counterfeiting paper is delayed in delivering to our country due to the impact of the epidemic."
He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. Khalil Aminu revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
"The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the goods, and then return to Sabah to carry out the final printing immediately. It is estimated that it will take about two more working days (December 20th) to hand over to the applicants. We will notify the applicants to go to each district office to collect their application forms."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 reports so far this year.
Is it almost time from 7:00 PM onwards now?
I am referring to food.
I am currently facing #PRS\_ORG# across from me.

The newly arrived solid-state mobile hard drive cannot be recognized by the mobile computer, while the USB drive can be recognized by the computer. The machine is light and handy, with a stylish appearance.
Today I used it in the afternoon, and it was very effective at dissipating heat. I basically didn't feel any discomfort, and the running speed was very fast. It can kill 99% of users on startup. The battery is also very powerful, and it can last for 9 hours on standby. If used for 4 hours, there should be no problem. Overall, this price can buy such a high-quality machine, and I feel very happy. Other functions can be discovered later, and I will supplement them later.
The appearance is very good. In terms of performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a while.
The machine is fast, much larger than I imagined, and the rendering effect is picture after picture, I like it very much. I will wait for some time before giving a detailed review. I found the serial number of this machine in Hong Kong, and the quality seems to be OK.
The feeling is not that it's big, but rather heavy. You can't hold it with one hand, and it's actually bigger than 15.6 inches. When it's running, it's very stable and you don't feel any lag. The sound of the fan dispersing heat is loved, it has a lot of feeling, and it won't keep flipping back and forth like a game console. It's much cheaper than the official flagship store, and it even comes with a backpack. I think it's great.
The store's service is also good. They reminded me to update my BIOS and promptly opened it. It's worth it!
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation is excellent, with a basic temperature of 0 degrees. Portability: It is convenient to carry due to its light and thin design. Appearance material: The traditional design of Thinkpad is satisfactory and trustworthy, with careful examination of the entire machine exterior, all interfaces, without any signs of refurbishment or use, it is truly a brand new and beautiful machine, with the same configuration as the page.
I forgot to bring my backpack, so I immediately helped me fill a backpack for you, although it is not a standard factory backpack, but in terms of service follow-up, it is enough to prove that you are a good-hearted seller. If you have a friend who needs to buy a notebook, please come back and buy it again.

Educational News: The ratio of special talents in the 2016 middle school entrance examination in Beijing was compressed on the 21st and 22nd of January. The organization of the middle school entrance examination for special talents in Beijing was unified by the respective education committees of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of gifted students in their admission plans, and the competition among gifted students has become more intense. For example, in Dongcheng District, the proportion of gifted students in primary schools who are admitted to middle schools is generally less than 5% of the total number of students in the district's admission plan, with a planned enrollment of 380 students. The admission rate is also less than 10% of the school's planned enrollment of 380 students.
All students with sports, art, and technology talents and who have registered online are eligible to participate in the talent examination. To facilitate students' participation in the examination, the arrangement for last year's examination in Dongcheng District will be continued, with one to two examination sites set up in each school, a total of 13 examination sites.
The examination points are divided into examination zones according to the examination zone, and the examination time is divided into units of one hour to arrange the examination schedule. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points at different examination zones and take the examination according to the examination schedule. On May 23rd, the list of students who have passed the examination will be announced on the website of the district education admission and examination center, and students can query the examination results on the website.

The president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee has expressed confidence that China has the ability to successfully host the Winter Olympics during a special period. The statement was made by the president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently. He said that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Winter Olympics in Beijing and believes that China has the capability to host a successful event during a special period.
Recently, Zhi Ping, the Chinese ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, visited the Olympic Center in Sarajevo and met with the president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic. During the meeting, Kvesic spoke highly of the relationship between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina and expressed his belief that China has the ability to successfully host the Winter Olympics during special times. The Bosnian side is looking forward to the Winter Olympics in Beijing and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing the event. They hope to use this opportunity to further expand cooperation in the field of sports with China.
Jiang Ping indicated that there is a special "Olympic belt" between China and the United States. The 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing will also be held, presenting a simple, safe, and spectacular show to the world.
China and Bosnia and Herzegovina are expected to deepen cooperation in the preparation and training of athletes for winter sports events, and the Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue playing a bridging role. With the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity, the embassy hopes to promote further cultural exchanges between the two countries and make the people of both countries "move towards the future" together. The embassy also wishes for Bosnian athletes to perform well at the Beijing Winter Olympics. Prior to this, the Bosnian Olympic Committee held a ceremony to present the "Best Athlete of the Year" award, and Yi Ping was invited as a special guest to present the award to the best young athlete in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video for the Beijing Winter Olympics is played in a loop at the event site.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核�
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the coastal city range in each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government and announcing it, to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, coastal cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their administrative areas.
The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies, we can turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of controlling the spread of the epidemic and reducing the risk of epidemic spillover. This can achieve the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been many local outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic in China, all of which were imported from foreign countries through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems with the monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, the implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, the formalism of regular nucleic acid testing, the inadequate disinfection of cold chain logistics, the irregular management of centralized isolation facilities, and the insufficient scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic.
Notice requires to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in the coastal city, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implement border control measures, and focus on nine aspects such as completing the weak links in the coastal city's epidemic prevention and control work, doing scientific and precise work in epidemic prevention and control, and tightening the defense line of epidemic prevention and control at the border. The notice emphasizes that coastal cities should study and deploy epidemic prevention and control work in parallel with ensuring people's livelihood, publish and disseminate the hotline for people's livelihood guarantee, and regularly investigate and solve problems such as hidden dangers in the supply and price of basic necessities of life.
According to the notice, the term "口岸城市" refers to the open land, water, and air border cities, as well as the counties (cities, districts, banners), cities (provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities), and directly-administered cities where they are located. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, and municipality) based on the epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.
Color: As shown in the picture, the shooting color difference cannot be avoided, and the real object is the closest color. The color of the clothing will become brighter under external lighting.

In the store, products labeled as "vintage" or "antique" are non-refundable. The term "vintage" refers to products that have a retro feel and are designed with a sense of nostalgia for a bygone era. This is why people who like vintage products also appreciate their age and quality.
Therefore, girls who cannot control themselves should not say that their clothes are old-fashioned. They can only say that you are not suitable for them. There is absolutely no risk-taking ability in cautious spending, online shopping has risks, and shopping needs to be done with caution.

The truth behind the US military's 20-year addiction to bloodshed and violence, as revealed in an oil pipeline video - Xinhua Net (video source: oil pipeline)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary named "Murder Machine" was posted on the oil pipeline platform, which attracted widespread attention. The film tells the story of the United States using the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to launch the war in Afghanistan, forcing the export of American democracy through war, resulting in 20 years of poverty, bloodlust, and cruelty, and committing various crimes against humanity.
The abuse of drone strikes on civilian targets, such as hospitals and schools, has twisted human nature and led to the formation of murderous groups. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has established a "black jail" to subject "criminals" to various forms of torture and humiliation. One case after another of inhumane crimes committed by the US military in Afghanistan has sparked more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video says, the "war on terror" in the US is "getting worse and more terrifying." The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but has only brought them a country full of scars and destruction and countless killings.
Watch the video and let's expose the truth behind America's "anti-terrorism" obsession with bloodshed and violence, and pierce through the hypocrisy of American democracy!
The food delivery was late, and when it arrived, it was cold. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard to eat. It was completely inedible and the soup spilled out.

"A flight attendant confirmed a few hours ago that they would no longer be willing to wait."
Don't push people onto the starting line - when browsing books on the New China Wire, you can often feel the explosion of success books.
Today's successful self-help books often proclaim the "best practices" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do. Essentially, they skip over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it."
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - either they finish to the best of their abilities or they don't bother finishing at all; either they are 100 or they are 0; either you climb to the top of the mountain or you wait patiently at the starting line. This "best principle" is so convincing that anyone who sees it will admit that it is "absolutely correct," but unfortunately, 99% of people will be knocked down at the starting line.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you need to make a decision, turn over a new leaf, and embark on a 180-degree transformation," which is precisely the fatal weakness of many people. For those who are rigid in following the rules, adhering to the old ways, and resisting change, you must shout "you need to change" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and ridiculing oneself.
Most people would be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to take action. They either make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and bravely take the first step, only to find that it doesn't last long and they can't sustain it. The famous song "Starting from Tomorrow" by Ma Xiaogui is a classic example of this "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, causing most people to "knock on the door in awe." Perhaps "the second-best principle" is a way that can help more ordinary people achieve relative success.
The core of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "striving for small victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand hill by your house, because that's still better than staying where you are. In short, whatever you do, it's always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in entry thresholds, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one is persistent, the success probability will also increase. However, following the "second-best principle" to success may require a slightly longer journey.
In summary, the "best principle" may sound like it's waving a flag for everyone to succeed, but in reality, it only truly motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" is more effective in motivating a larger number of people and maximizing the benefits for as many people as possible.
"Do I need to reorder now?"
"电话无人接听不停延误" can be translated to "The phone keeps ringing without anyone answering."
May I ask, when will it be sent?
How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two meals, but there is an order that has been completed. I would like to ask how to contact the delivery person.
The first co-pilot just told me that there should be another co-pilot to send.
The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection in 2002, according to the latest monitoring results obtained by a reporter from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Qinghai Province.
The Qinghai Lake carp, also known as the "Tibetan carp", is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Qinghai Lake carp was severely affected by human overfishing, breeding in large numbers, and degradation of the aquatic environment, resulting in a sharp decline in its population. In 2002, the resource stock of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese Species Red List listed the naked carp from Qinghai Lake as an endangered species. Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from catching, selling, or trading naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release of fish and the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages", measures have been continuously strengthened to protect Qinghai Lake. The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased year by year through artificial breeding and release. Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province Assistant Minister Yang Lin introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 billion fish have been implemented through artificial breeding and release in Qinghai Lake carp, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources.
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the Gobi Desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the water body of Qinghai Lake, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and protect the aquatic wildlife, the comprehensive ban on fishing in the Three Rivers Source Area and the water body of Qinghai Lake has been implemented since this year, and a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system has been established.

The restaurant only gave me a bag to put my food in, and it's cold outside.
May I ask, is the food delivered in a bag? We only see one bag.
Want to know if it was an oversight or if someone took it, thanks.
It has been 1 hour already, and I still haven't sent it.
Today is the Winter Solstice, and it is customary to send gifts of food to friends and family. However, if you accidentally send the wrong gift, it can be disappointing. It is best to book a separate table for children to eat at a restaurant.
I hope that in the busy store, you can take a moment to check the quality of the products you are selling.
Is it because the foot bath basin is leaking electricity? Choosing an appropriate foot bath basin can play a good therapeutic role in foot health.

A more natural and fluent translation could be different depending on the context and purpose of the translation.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market. From over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, bathtubs with luxurious designs are available, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-related appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, which poses a certain safety risk.
"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath for his father as a birthday gift, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation on the bottom of his feet.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that was causing the sensation in his feet, but he didn't realize that he had turned off the vibration function. Even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although they refused to return the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular bathtub that has been around for a long time now has no clear and detailed industry regulations on its highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees.
However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to electrical problems, but there may be a few products that were not strictly inspected during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a disassembled bathtub.
Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards. At the same time, you can freely take an electric pen test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo opened today - Point of View - Hunan Daily Online - Xinhua Online Hunan Daily December 10, 2022 (Full-media reporter Zhang Shanyu, Hu Pianpian, Correspondent Liu Xiaoling, Photographer Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Hengzhou Red Tea Promotion Conference were held in the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of reaching a tea output of 1 trillion yuan.
The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Vice Chairman Hu Shunli and Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress Yao Hong attended the opening ceremony. Professor Liu Zhonghua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the opening ceremony: The source of Hubei's red tea is in Nanchang, and the rising of Longjing tea injects new vitality into "Five-Colored Xiang tea".
In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of a trillion-yuan Zhejiang tea industry, and forming a development pattern of "Three Zhejiangs, Four Waters, and Five Teas". The tea industry in Zhejiang has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main types of tea, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving tea farmers to increase their income.
The feng shui cycle turns, and the red tea gains strength. Provincial tea experts say that after harvesting green tea and red tea, black tea, tea farmers can earn income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens continues to rise linearly.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders awarded the fourth batch of enterprises with the right to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. New Haven was excited to embrace "The Source of Hunan Red Tea." In the New Haven Tea Museum, Fujian tea merchants fell in love with a high-mountain tea named "Spring in the Ice," and immediately placed an order.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said happily that the epidemic and other factors have had some impact on the tea market, but from the scene of the tea exhibition, the highlights are eye-catching. The new Hubei red tea has a touch of red, injecting tea culture into it, and it is popular and hot, with the Shaanxi tea industry eagerly welcoming the new spring.
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled? I don't want them anymore because I can't stop here, and he couldn't send them over.
#AMOUNT# yuan has been received, it is the missing food.

Set pricing: 1000 yuan for thanking the rabbit for its review. Originally, I was going to say that it's not suitable for the ancient style, but I didn't expect the final product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dan Dan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can make us continue to be full of energy and move forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great. I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
Regardless of whether it's about reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography, or post-production, there's no room for compromise. Makeup artists are particularly meticulous, and they will tailor your makeup to suit your style. The makeup products they use are all from top brands.
Mr. Tan is no longer needed to speak, photography is a profession in itself. The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two cute little kittens who play and accompany us.
We are working in Beijing, and all the good movie theaters in Beijing need to be booked half a year in advance. My colleagues have been to Beijing and said that the movie was just so-so. I specially searched for this workspace, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression control is not very good, and we think this is a common problem for most people. The photographer Xiaohong will take pictures and record the natural beauty of the moment. Makeup artist, photographer, post-production design, a luxurious team.
"Come out as a film, we and the people around us all praise it without end. I have already recommended it to my friends, and my friends who saw the trailer were also full of joy and excitement."
I hope this kind of workspace won't be buried, and more people will discover TA, and express their own style instead of being uniform. Thank you very much for the five-star review from Cai Xiong and Xing Liang. Both of them are very creative and have great ideas. We are a creative workshop, and we will do our best with 100% effort and 200% enthusiasm to meet the customer's requirements. Thank you for meeting and getting to know each other.
A sweet and caring assistant, as well as a lively and open-minded photographer teacher, each member of the team is incredibly nice and beautiful. It was an unforgettable experience, and the results of the shoot exceeded my expectations by a long shot. Thank you all for your hard work. It was a pleasure to meet you all, and it's nice to know you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you have placed in us is like a journey of several thousand kilometers. I am very happy to have met you all, and I hope to have the opportunity to come back to Qinhuangdao and play again in the future.
I want to know how to give money? The meal that was sent again has already been delivered.
"No waiter is currently available to take my order at the restaurant."
A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and you need to spend six months to learn.
But if you're planning to enter this industry, training is definitely a great choice, especially for those who lack self-sufficiency and need to improve. If you have a relatively strong self-sufficiency, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. Firstly, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong teaching staff.
Secondly, before choosing, investigate the training institution. It is best to investigate the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how good or bad the teaching is and how good or bad the curriculum is. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't introduced your situation to me. And the relationship between learning this and your personal situation is quite significant.
For example, your professional background, age, desired language, and even the city you want to study or work in are all related to your field of study or desired profession. If you are still a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is quite significant, usually requiring 3-6 months of concentrated training.
But if it were me saying these things, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet nowadays, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find them, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources or detailed consultations. There are also some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time cost, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teacher's explanations are also very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone specially assigned to answer them. Moreover, many training institutions now have employment agreements with companies, and they will recommend you to the company after you finish your training. This way, when you go for an interview for a job in the future, you can save a lot of trouble.
Here are some of my thoughts. Since I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction and didn't go into detail. If you have any other questions or would like to consult with me, you can contact me at any time to discuss and communicate.
I said 1 point earlier, I saw it in the App as well.
What do you call it when I haven't finished speaking, and what are you doing?
The following is the translation of the given text from Chinese to English:  Personally, I undertake various tasks such as installation, cleaning, maintenance of boilers, water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil burners, lighting fixtures, professional sewing, and home cleaning services. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. I strive to work hard for a better life, although it can be tiring at times, I will continue to persevere.
Life will not burden every effort of the person who loves it. If you like it, please pay attention to me. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is like this, others only look at the result, while I alone carry on the process and face life. We are not only strong, but also persistent. We have no choice but to continue on our path, and although the road can be retraced, it cannot be retraced.
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes delightful through sincerity. Although we may be doing the dirtiest job, we will approach each corner of the customer's house with the most serious attitude and make it spotlessly clean. Seeing the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised thumb, that moment of fatigue is all worth it, and the effort is finally rewarded!
My daily work - your requirements, my service.
"用心服务，用心清洁，留住美好。您关心的细节，丰桂家政帮你做到了“净”我所能，服务爱家。"
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  保万家洁净，树家政囗碑，服务到位，洁净到家。室内外保洁，我的日常工作。
The crystal lamp may be beautiful, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and lack luster. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. Similarly, in life, we must take care to cultivate and refine ourselves in order to succeed. We must pay attention to the details and work hard to create a beautiful and refined life.
Give me a chance, and I will definitely make you satisfied. Quality speaks for everything, because professionalism deserves to be trusted. Your recognition is my greatest encouragement! The current situation in various industries is not ideal either.
"But I always believe that as long as we have a serious attitude, persevere, and work hard, we will be better than others, at least we won't be complaining all day long!" One day's plan begins in the morning, all the beauty starts from the early morning. I hope you can start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything goes as planned. Keep a good mood all day long and have a good morning!
When I was young, happiness was something I possessed, and having it made me happy; as I grew older, happiness became a goal I sought to achieve, and achieving it made me happy; but as I matured, I discovered that happiness was actually a state of mind, and understanding it made me truly happy. By being the best version of myself and acting in accordance with my heart, I can live a life without regrets; life is but one path, and it is up to us to choose our own way; the two greatest treasures in life are a healthy body and a good mood, and we should strive to enjoy them throughout our lives.
At each stage of life, we will encounter different challenges. Many times, the obstacles that bind us are not our abilities, but our courage to face them head-on.
Since we can't avoid it, we might as well face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you are to be overwhelmed by difficulties; if you face your challenges bravely, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The curator of the China-Saudi Arabia joint exhibition held the first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition - Xinhua Net Beijing December 12th (reporter Wang Haiqing Huang Can) The first Saudi Arabia Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennial Exhibition was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah JAX Art Zone in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with 64 artists from Saudi Arabia, China, and other regions participating in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition is jointly planned by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the China UCCA Dairyards Contemporary Art Center. The director of the China UCCA Dairyards Contemporary Art Center, Tian Weiping, serves as the art director of this exhibition. According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biannual exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which reflects the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as the current situation of cultural development in Saudi society.
This year's dual-year exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters. The exhibition hall is composed of six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Touching the Stones to Cross the River," "Tradition as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Going Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, the number of works by 27 Saudi Arabian artists accounts for more than four-fifths of the total number of exhibits, including painting, installation art, and performance art in various forms. Twelve Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create art using recycled materials. For example, in "The Story Behind the Mountains Never Ends" series (2014) by Xu Bing, he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded objects.
The executive director of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakkali, expressed the hope that this year's biennale would establish an international dialogue, allowing audiences around the world to understand the vibrant cultural industry and creative community in Saudi Arabia, and strengthen interaction and exchange. Tianwei Yu said, "The goal of the biennale is dual, allowing Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global conversation and enabling Saudi audiences to engage with the contemporary art world."
According to the understanding, there will be a series of lectures during the two-year exhibition cycle, and artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and contemporary art development.
I ordered a meat-chopping knife from a restaurant and told them that the delivery person cannot send bones.

Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net Yunnan Province Kunming December 12th (reporter Lin Bixiong) In order to continuously do well in poverty alleviation job assistance and consolidate the expansion of poverty reduction achievements, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, which will assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources introduced that at present, a total of 44.83 million rural public service positions have been developed in Yunnan, which are used to employ vulnerable groups in rural areas, such as poverty-stricken laborers, and have played an important role in helping these groups achieve employment growth, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas. This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Department of Human Resources, the Rural Revitalization Office, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public service positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
In terms of position development, the new regulations are clear, and position development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "as needed, based on positions, dynamic management, and total volume control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person, one position, self-initiated public disclosure, and unified management." Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of advertisement, application, review, announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment.
In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.
Hello, the address is wrong.
Can you cancel the order and let me reorder?
Have you canceled it?
Although the right-wing has had some glorious times in history, it has not lasted long, so it is short-lived. This is because a little bit of sunshine can make it shine brightly, and a little bit of water can cause sweating; when it gains a little bit of power, it becomes arrogant and overbearing. However, in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in promoting social progress.
From the definition of truth standards at the end of the Cultural Revolution to the development of the economy, the promotion of technological advancement, and the institutionalization of governance and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of right-wing thinking should not be denied.  Thirdly, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his views and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his views on China's social issues.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and that it will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. It will also provide an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene. Fourthly, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunists who try to profit from the situation are not right-wingers, but rather troublemakers.
Let's talk more about the left. The left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of history and politics.
If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost this opportunity because the left's goal is exactly what the Communist Party has discarded! Fifthly, I recently saw some friends who were both angry at the villains and ridiculed the left's illusions. They were full of energy, but I think it's unnecessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists. It's a matter of principle, and there's no logic to it. Also, don't try to prove that we're right, and don't even think about making enemies and leftists admit it. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the villain insults you for five cents, and when the left-handed person insults you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but after they became old, they forgot their ideals, or pursued them and ended up as fanatics.
The ideal gradually approaches, and even the slaughter of the dragon youth eventually turns into an evil dragon. I feel that "left and right" generally refers to constraints and freedom, and China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic inheritance.
The right-wing libertarians in China prioritize efficiency and development, while the left-wingers strengthen regulation and place greater emphasis on fairness and safety. In general, society now desires a greater emphasis on fairness. At the same time, tensions between China and the US are escalating, and the left-wing is generally favored. It is estimated that this trend will continue for many years to come.
Although I can't understand it, just clicking the like button is enough, and I won't say anything else. The flowers are just so noble.

Today, let's take a look at some "weird searches" [奇怪的热搜]. What is the normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lifting of the Dragon's Head, Hua Li You's Price Hike, and the Xiang La La Incident. As the buzz spreads and forms a peak, then [the index decreases] (smooth curve). Finally, the buzz dissipates, and if a secondary buzz occurs, there will be a small peak again. They look exactly the same as the [network buzz evolution model] displayed on the official website of the State Internet Information Office.
What is an abnormal public opinion? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of a peak, a sawtooth, and a cliff.
The following is the translation of the text from Chinese to English:  【Isolated Peak】This refers to the situation where people act as a catalyst for heating, resulting in rapid climbing of the hot search rankings and attracting public attention.  【Sawtooth Shape】This refers to the situation where periodic heating occurs, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings.  【Cliff Edge】This refers to the situation where a collective withdrawal occurs, and the hot search performs its "function," receiving a new task and moving towards a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave exactly matches the trough of another event's heat wave, with time differences of only seconds, indicating that it must be a unified naval fleet receiving a task, marking the start of a new round of attacks.
The professionalism of black PR can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke war, which ones shift the focus, which ones influence cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones incite emotions, which ones wrap up decisions, black product accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, almost considering all factors involved in the spread of public opinion. Publicity is a scientific discipline, discarding all subjective factors such as stand and emotions, only from the objective data, black PR also has no place to hide.
Translation:  All who pass by must leave behind traces, such traces as we dig out together. Source of data: Time Machine.
Mauritius and other countries have reported the first case of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.  According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported the first cases of the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on November 10th. According to the Minister of Health, Karelle Désirée Gopal, one of the infected individuals was a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th, while the other was a local resident who had contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius. The latter tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the two infected individuals had their nucleic acid test results turn to negative, and they have now returned to their respective places of residence. The Cyprus Health Department announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.
These three people are all students. They returned to the country this month after traveling abroad. Due to their mild illnesses, they have not been hospitalized for treatment. To prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has been strengthening its epidemic prevention and control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all passengers aged 12 or above who enter China by flight will need to pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport upon arrival. The Civil Aviation Administration announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in China with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.
The Minister of Health in Malawi, Khumbize Chipanda, said on the 9th that the country has discovered 3 cases of COVID-19 infection caused by the Omicron variant for the first time. The Ministry of Health in Malawi conducted gene sequencing on 12 new COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these 3 cases of infection.

I don't think this will be of any help!
The Chinese text "收到是金钱肚订单是凤爪" can be translated to English as "Money talks."
"Good, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do you need to stay in the conversation?"
I called your staff and explained everything to them.
Your co-pilot told me the address is too far.
The text is in Chinese and it reads:  "大美360集成家装地 址：环城南路156号幸福家园12楼"  The English translation of the text is:  "Great Beauty 360 integrates home furnishings. Address: No. 156, Circle City South Road, Happy Family Garden Apartment 12th Floor."
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. When I arrived at the store, I started a series of tricks.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan. They didn't measure the actual size of the house, yet they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 7 million. They basically showed me their materials without knowing what brand they were. Their second trick is that once you hand over the deposit at the store, you'll be dragged to sign the contract (and once you've signed, you'll never be able to get your money back, unless you have enough experience and can handle their bureaucracy).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. At the time of excitement, I paid over 10,000 yuan in deposit.
He gave me a quote with many problems. The price is 7 million without including water and electricity renovation, and it doesn't include any doors or cabinets. The bathroom is also not included. These three items are the main costs of basic installation. Excluding these, their service point fees are higher than other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. At the beginning, nothing was clear and they made me sign a contract. When I went to them to ask for my money back, they acted like they had a lot of experience and had a special team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it is, it will bite the customer's problem, and they are completely innocent. Various shifting of responsibility, as well as many details, I don't want to say all of them are tears. In summary, don't choose them because my friend found their renovation of the house to be of poor quality, and they will charge you various fees in the later stage.
Pitfall, they were originally the decorative dragon heads used to deceive people, but now they have been transformed into large and beautiful ones, as if they have collapsed and been replaced by others. Therefore, everyone should avoid choosing such a pitfall decoration company for their home renovation.
In the future, everyone should carefully consider when choosing and consulting because renovation is not a small expense. If you want to ask the merchant questions, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibited from publishing various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant's recording statement for detailed information. The Qunxing Decoration and Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours. Find a decoration company and submit your review on the Qunxing Decoration and Design Channel.
This is so terrifying, if it doesn't arrive within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel if it takes more than 15 minutes.
The chicken should be cooked, but the one I received is raw, and I can't eat it.
Already 3 days without a reply... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan! The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card when I pay.
May I ask if it is possible for me to be exempted from paying the transportation fee every time and have my monthly fee collected by you after your investigation is completed?
How can I contact the delivery agent?
It's already 3 o'clock, isn't it time for me to receive compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to send the goods, but the delivery driver put it at the door, and then the people left.
The Chinese text "还送错" can be translated to English as "Sorry for the mistake."
Your delivery partner has already picked up my order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting for the delivery rider to arrive at 19:25, even though they have already received my order.
After I finish my shopping, what should I do with the other takeout orders?
Where is your co-pilot going and when will you be back?
"I am going to send a complaint. If you do not cancel, I will report it to the police."
"But my food may have safety and hygiene issues."

Thank you for helping me.
From the past to the present, I have always been opposed to any form of pollution and verbal abuse, and I cannot accept such behavior towards individuals. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of bad behavior.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing you need to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior. From the moment you start sending friend requests on Facebook and posting content with sarcasm, to the point where you try to publish my supposed home address and father's name on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude towards you.
After you, the frequency of tagging me has increased significantly, not only on Instagram, but also on Facebook, where you and your so-called friends continue to discuss some embarrassing and obscure remarks about me, such as my appearance, figure, upbringing, what kind of fruit I like to eat in bed, and whether or not I like to insert things. I... I've also had enough. How did it come to pass that I later received messages from multiple friends on your Facebook account, containing photos of you and sexually suggestive comments?
Sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my report was uploaded, you did not calm down at all, but rather became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your identity status, in our society, it is necessary to respect each other's gender. Yes, you can continue with this kind of teasing, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language, you can continue to say that you only care about and pay attention to me, and you can continue to deny that it is not your doing or continue to publish all kinds of attacking statements.
"No, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and build don't need your praise or criticism."
I don't even think there is a girl who would be willing to humiliate herself like this in exchange for fame. A friend asked me if I was okay.
I said it, you won't believe it. I think no woman can be so humiliated and still say she's okay.
Regardless of whether it is in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who have no basic morality will choose to harm any woman. I believe that justice will prevail in people's hearts.
I cut off part of the comment for everyone to evaluate your own post. No one can impersonate you, right?
I can only say that you are a civilized enemy who makes me smile.
I have reported it and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What kind of cow is this? It's not a real cow, it's just a chicken with saliva.  Note: This is a play on words in Chinese, where "牛" (niu) means "cow" and "口水" (kou sui) means "saliva." The phrase "口水鸡" (kou sui jī) is a slang term for a person who is talkative and excessively gossipy, while "生肉" (shēng ròu) means "fresh meat" and is often used to refer to someone who is new or inexperienced in a particular field.
"没办法吃" is a Chinese phrase that translates to "can't eat" or "won't eat" in English. It is often used to express that someone is unable or unwilling to eat something.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food and not leftovers?
"unacceptable" means "不可接受的" in Chinese.
The Chinese text "说是 7 点多送到为什么要重新制作" can be translated to English as "Why do you need to remake it if it's supposed to be delivered at 7:01?"
The Chinese phrase "太离谱了" can be translated to English as "It's too far-fetched."

The Yangtze River's mainstream has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua Net, Wuhan, December 11 (reporter Wang Xian). The Qingbaijiang Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was successfully put into operation on the 10th, which is the second water-based green comprehensive service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Qingbaijiang Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan was officially put into operation on the 8th.
To this point, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau deputy director, Qi Junhua, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built and put into operation 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has been well received by the majority of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the green voyage along the Yangtze River, which significantly enhances the receiving capacity of ship pollutants and the service capabilities of navigation. According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area provides comprehensive production and living services for all types of ships and crew, and is an important facility for helping seafarers solve the urgent and difficult problems they face.
This is the translation from Chinese to English:  The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this time, integrate life services, production services, and public services into one body, with green environmental protection as the main theme, and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as their special feature. They aim to provide "one-stop docking and multiple services" for ships in the port, making the work of sailors who regularly sail on the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient.
I've been waiting for you guys for a long time now. Can you please hurry up?

The joint drill "Peaceful Relief-2021" between the armed forces of China and Vietnam has successfully concluded. All participating Chinese troops have safely returned to their base in Guangxi, China, marking the successful completion of the 7-day training mission.
This joint performance focused on the topic of humanitarian medical rescue, with both Chinese and Vietnamese troops tightly adhering to the mission of guarding and rescuing the wounded, and completing joint command, on-site rescue, and mass treatment of casualties in accordance with practical standards. The exercise effectively enhanced the capabilities of both armies in providing emergency medical support. The results of the exercise were recognized by both the Chinese and Vietnamese militaries.
The chairman of the rehearsal guidance committee and the deputy chief of the logistics department of the Vietnamese People's Army, Colonel Nguyen Huong Son, said at the conclusion of the rehearsal that through this rehearsal, Vietnamese medical personnel have learned about the organization and professional activities from Chinese medical personnel, as well as recognized the medical and protective equipment of the Chinese side. The results achieved in this rehearsal proved the professional capabilities of the medical forces of both countries in medical assistance and epidemic prevention and control.
The Chinese guidance and coordination team leader and the deputy director of the Logistics Support Department of the Central Military Commission, Chen Chunming, said that this exercise was another innovative practice based on the successful joint search and rescue activity held in 2018, with significant milestone significance. During the exercise, the Chinese People's Liberation Army donated medical protective masks, medical protective clothing, and rapid nucleic acid testing equipment to the Vietnamese People's Army for health and epidemic prevention purposes.
