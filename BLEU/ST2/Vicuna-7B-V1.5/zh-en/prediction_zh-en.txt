想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。

ASSISTANT: I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a coach with a similar price first. It's not friendly, and in fact, the price often corresponds to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then expensive coaching will seem more friendly than cheap coaching, and this type of "entry-level coaching" is actually industrial waste.

ASSISTANT: They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is huge. Even with a hard ball, it's hard for top players to control it. The logic and subtext of their existence is that tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll make a cheap and nasty one that you can use twice and then give up on it. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.

ASSISTANT: Wait until you can truly distinguish between good and bad, indicating your progress, and then come back to buy my expensive ones. I'll make two times the money. It's recommended to spend a similar amount of money on a second-hand camera that's a bit better, choose between Prince or Tuellup. These two brands don't have much reputation, so good cameras don't sell for a high price. A new one for 500 or 600 is good, a second-hand one for 200.

裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。

ASSISTANT: If you wear clothes that are split into upper, middle, and lower sections, it will make you appear taller, and this is achieved by using different colors for the top, skirt, and long-sleeved shirt. This will give the impression of a slimming effect. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the standard issue for chubby girls (a point that the author feels deeply), and dark colors are also a good way to conceal your body fat. High-class and elegant black shorts are also the first choice for chubby girls.

对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: For girls who are slightly overweight, it is necessary to teach them how to dress appropriately. Do not let overweight girls wear tight short skirts. Also, do not wear tops that are too short or stuffed inside the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear a black long-sleeved t-shirt or a mesh t-shirt (with a fine grid pattern, please). Choose a soft and comfortable printed skirt, and match it with a shirt with a ruffled collar. This can effectively cover the shortcomings of overweight girls.

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。

ASSISTANT: A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23rd, protesting against three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Princeton University, and Yale University - for discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.

牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。

ASSISTANT: The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the trial. The organization's chairman, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission criteria of top US universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three top US universities has basically remained at the same level.

许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: Many studies have shown that these universities, in the so-called "holistic consideration" admission process, "systematically and persistently discriminate against Asian applicants." Zhao Yuxuan introduced that in 2014, Sanders et al.'s research showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian students were admitted at the lowest rate among all ethnic groups.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。

ASSISTANT: The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that he hoped that after submitting the lawsuit, the US Department of Education and the Justice Department would launch an investigation and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian applicants in their admissions.

ASSISTANT: The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating in admissions, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept the complaint on procedural grounds. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American organizations that participated in the complaint, there were also Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American education organizations that participated in the petition.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory building located in Shaojing Town, Yiwu City, Zhejiang Province from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Li decided to buy the factory building. In December 2020, after negotiating with the owner's family member Ms. Lin regarding the details of the purchase, Mr. Li paid a deposit of 200,000 yuan through a bank transfer on the same day.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Building Sale and Purchase Agreement" as the payee. It was stipulated in the agreement that if the buyer did not want to buy the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the seller, and if the seller did not want to sell the factory building, the deposit would be returned to the buyer. The agreement also stipulated that both parties should sign the factory building sale and purchase agreement within one week. However, due to the failure of both parties to reach an agreement on the main contract terms such as the sales range and payment methods, the signing of the factory building sale and purchase agreement was delayed.

考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Liu. After a long search, Mr. Liu finally found a suitable house, paid the deposit, and was ready to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell the house, which made Mr. Liu feel helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。

ASSISTANT: For this reason, Mr. Liu sued Mr. Lin to the Yueyang City People's Court. The court after investigation found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and it was not reasonable to blame only the defendant. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double return of deposit, and the defendant does not need to assume the breach of contract liability of returning the deposit twice.

ASSISTANT: Lawyer's Reminder: In the trading process, it is necessary to exercise caution and prudence. As the buyer, you should exercise caution and prudence when signing a contract, such as verifying the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the delivery time and location in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when fulfilling the contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。

ASSISTANT: In Sabah, 3,200 newborn babies have not received their birth certificates due to the shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Sabah National Registration Department said that since the beginning of October, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies due to the lack of anti-forgery paper, and the number of affected individuals has reached 3,200 to date.

不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。

ASSISTANT: However, the head of the immigration office, Kazuo Aminu, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have had their information recorded in the system. He said that when anti-forgery paper arrives next week, the missing certificates will be reissued. Aminu made the statement at a press conference in response to a net media report that the birth certificate printing problem in Sabah had lasted for over 10 months.

他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。

ASSISTANT: He explained that the paper used in Sabah is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. Khalil Aminu revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper has arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.

ASSISTANT: "The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next week to pick up the goods, and then return to Sabah to carry out the final printing immediately. It is estimated that it will take about two more working days (December 20th) to hand over to the applicants.

ASSISTANT: The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Office has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. By implementing differentiated management policies, we can turn one line of defense into two lines of defense, which can achieve the goal of controlling the spread of the epidemic and reducing the risk of epidemic spillover. This can achieve the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and the lowest social cost.

ASSISTANT: Notice requires to strengthen the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in the coastal city, improve the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, implement border control measures, and focus on nine aspects such as completing the weak links in the coastal city's epidemic prevention and control work, doing scientific and precise work in epidemic prevention and control, and tightening the defense line of epidemic prevention and control at the border.

绝大多数人都会在“转变”两字面前露怯，裹足不前，难下决心；又或者凭着一时的冲动痛下了“转变”之决心，并勇敢地迈出了第一步，但往往是好景不长，坚持不了多一会儿就败下阵来，难见持续性。马三立先生那段著名的《从明天开始》的相声，就是最传神地表现了这一“普遍人性”的经典。

ASSISTANT: Most people would be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate to take action. They either make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and bravely take the first step, only to find that it doesn't last long and they can't sustain it. The famous song "Starting from Tomorrow" by Ma Xiaogui is a classic example of this "universal human nature."

“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。

ASSISTANT: The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the ability limit of ordinary people, causing most people to "knock on the door in awe." Perhaps "the second-best principle" is a way that can help more ordinary people achieve relative success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。

ASSISTANT: The core of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "striving for small victories", that is, if you can't do 100, just do 1, because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, just climb the small sand hill by your house, because that's still better than staying where you are. In short, whatever you do, it's always better than doing nothing.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。

ASSISTANT: Due to the significant reduction in entry thresholds, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one is persistent, the success probability will also increase. However, following the "second-best principle" to success may require a slightly longer journey.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: In summary, the "best principle" may sound like it's waving a flag for everyone to succeed, but in reality, it only truly motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" is more effective in motivating a larger number of people and maximizing the benefits for as many people as possible.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。

ASSISTANT: The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons, an increase of more than 40 times compared to the initial protection in 2002, according to the latest monitoring results obtained by a reporter from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs in Qinghai Province.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。

ASSISTANT: The Qinghai Lake carp, also known as the "Tibetan carp", is a rare and valuable fish species endemic to Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and diversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake watershed. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Qinghai Lake carp was severely affected by human overfishing, breeding in large numbers, and degradation of the aquatic environment, resulting in a sharp decline in its population. In 2002, the resource stock of Qinghai Lake carp was only 2592 tons.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: In 2004, the Chinese Species Red List listed the naked carp from Qinghai Lake as an endangered species. Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from catching, selling, or trading naked carp and its products.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。

ASSISTANT: At the same time, through the artificial breeding and release of fish and the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake, as well as the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passages", measures have been continuously strengthened to protect Qinghai Lake. The resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake carp has increased year by year through artificial breeding and release. Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province Assistant Minister Yang Lin introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 billion fish have been implemented through artificial breeding and release in Qinghai Lake carp, contributing more than 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake carp resources.

ASSISTANT: The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is an important ecological barrier and water source in China and even Asia, and Qinghai Lake serves as a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the expansion of the Gobi Desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment of the Three Rivers Source Area and the water body of Qinghai Lake, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and protect the aquatic wildlife, the comprehensive ban on fishing in the Three Rivers Source Area and the water body of Qinghai Lake has been implemented since this year, and a "one river, one river, one lake" comprehensive ban on fishing management system has been established.

ASSISTANT: With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market. From over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, bathtubs with luxurious designs are available, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-related appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, which poses a certain safety risk.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。

ASSISTANT: A programming beginner who wants to share personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a place for training. However, if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study, because the cost of training is very high and you need to spend six months to learn.

但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

ASSISTANT: Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. Firstly, we need to look at the teaching staff of this institution. If the teaching staff is not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong teaching staff.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before choosing, investigate the training institution. It is best to investigate the students of this institution, after all, only the students of the institution know how good or bad the teaching is and how good or bad the curriculum is. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because I haven't introduced your situation to me. And the relationship between learning this and your personal situation is quite significant.

比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。

ASSISTANT: For example, your professional background, age, desired language, and even the city you want to study or work in are all related to your field of study or desired profession. If you are still a student and haven't graduated yet, or if you are a computer science graduate, then if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are actually quite good, but the cost of learning is high and the investment of time is quite significant, usually requiring 3-6 months of concentrated training.

但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

ASSISTANT: But if it were me saying these things, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet nowadays, and there are also many training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know where to find them, you can contact me through the introduction and get free resources or detailed consultations. There are also some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time cost, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without spending too much effort, and the teacher's explanations are also very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone specially assigned to answer them. Moreover, many training institutions now have employment agreements with companies, and they will recommend you to the company after you finish your training. This way, when you go for an interview for a job in the future, you can save a lot of trouble.

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。

ASSISTANT: Yunnan: Coordinate and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net Yunnan Province Kunming December 12th (reporter Lin Bixiong) In order to continuously do well in poverty alleviation job assistance and consolidate the expansion of poverty reduction achievements, Yunnan Province has recently introduced policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, which will assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。

ASSISTANT: The Yunnan Provincial Department of Human Resources introduced that at present, a total of 44.83 million rural public service positions have been developed in Yunnan, which are used to employ vulnerable groups in rural areas, such as poverty-stricken laborers, and have played an important role in helping these groups achieve employment growth, consolidate the results of poverty alleviation, and effectively improve the capacity of various public services in rural areas. This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Department of Human Resources, the Rural Revitalization Office, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of recruitment for rural public service positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

ASSISTANT: In terms of position development, the new regulations are clear, and position development should be carried out in accordance with the principles of "as needed, based on positions, dynamic management, and total volume control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person, one position, self-initiated public disclosure, and unified management." Recruitment procedures must be carried out in accordance with the steps of advertisement, application, review, announcement, hiring, pre-employment training, and job assignment.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require each department responsible for developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position holders. It is also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

ASSISTANT: Although the right-wing has had some glorious times in history, it has not lasted long, so it is short-lived. This is because a little bit of sunshine can make it shine brightly, and a little bit of water can cause sweating; when it gains a little bit of power, it becomes arrogant and overbearing. However, in reality, the right-wing has played an active role in promoting social progress.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。

ASSISTANT: From the definition of truth standards at the end of the Cultural Revolution to the development of the economy, the promotion of technological advancement, and the institutionalization of governance and the protection of human rights, the positive significance of right-wing thinking should not be denied.

Thirdly, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his views and highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his views on China's social issues.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is not necessary, and that it will inevitably lead to social unrest, damage people's livelihoods, and create chaos in political parties. It will also provide an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene. Fourthly, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Political opportunists who try to profit from the situation are not right-wingers, but rather troublemakers.

再聊聊左。左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。

ASSISTANT: Let's talk more about the left. The left, in fact, is a group of abandoned children of history and politics.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。

ASSISTANT: If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost this opportunity because the left's goal is exactly what the Communist Party has discarded! Fifthly, I recently saw some friends who were both angry at the villains and ridiculed the left's illusions. They were full of energy, but I think it's unnecessary.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

ASSISTANT: Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists. It's a matter of principle, and there's no logic to it. Also, don't try to prove that we're right, and don't even think about making enemies and leftists admit it. Why bother?
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the villain insults you for five cents, and when the left-handed person insults you for your right dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people had ideals when they were young, but after they became old, they forgot their ideals, or pursued them and ended up as fanatics.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。

ASSISTANT: The ideal gradually approaches, and even the slaughter of the dragon youth eventually turns into an evil dragon. I feel that "left and right" generally refers to constraints and freedom, and China's overall tendency should be biased towards the left due to its historical and cultural genetic inheritance.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: The right-wing libertarians in China prioritize efficiency and development, while the left-wingers strengthen regulation and place greater emphasis on fairness and safety. In general, society now desires a greater emphasis on fairness. At the same time, tensions between China and the US are escalating, and the left-wing is generally favored. It is estimated that this trend will continue for many years to come.

ASSISTANT: Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lifting of the Dragon's Head, Hua Li You's Price Hike, and the Xiang La La Incident. As the buzz spreads and forms a peak, then [the index decreases] (smooth curve). Finally, the buzz dissipates, and if a secondary buzz occurs, there will be a small peak again. They look exactly the same as the [network buzz evolution model] displayed on the official website of the State Internet Information Office.

ASSISTANT: The following is the translation of the text from Chinese to English:

【Isolated Peak】This refers to the situation where people act as a catalyst for heating, resulting in rapid climbing of the hot search rankings and attracting public attention.

【Sawtooth Shape】This refers to the situation where periodic heating occurs, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings.

【Cliff Edge】This refers to the situation where a collective withdrawal occurs, and the hot search performs its "function," receiving a new task and moving towards a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave exactly matches the trough of another event's heat wave, with time differences of only seconds, indicating that it must be a unified naval fleet receiving a task, marking the start of a new round of attacks.

黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。

ASSISTANT: The professionalism of black PR can be seen in a few spots: several hot searches at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones provoke war, which ones shift the focus, which ones influence cognition, which ones lead to wrong judgments, which ones incite emotions, which ones wrap up decisions, black product accounts are divided into batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, almost considering all factors involved in the spread of public opinion. Publicity is a scientific discipline, discarding all subjective factors such as stand and emotions, only from the objective data, black PR also has no place to hide.

我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: I went to the store for the first time just to show them my floor plan. They didn't measure the actual size of the house, yet they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 7 million. They basically showed me their materials without knowing what brand they were. Their second trick is that once you hand over the deposit at the store, you'll be dragged to sign the contract (and once you've signed, you'll never be able to get your money back, unless you have enough experience and can handle their bureaucracy).

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being cheated. At the time of excitement, I paid over 10,000 yuan in deposit.

长江干流实现水上绿色综合服务区全覆盖-新华网新华社武汉12月11日电（记者王贤）重庆市涪陵水上绿色综合服务区10日如期建成投入运营，这是继8日四川省泸州水上绿色综合服务区挂牌运营后，长江上游正式运营的第2个水上绿色综合服务区。

ASSISTANT: The Yangtze River's mainstream has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua Net, Wuhan, December 11 (reporter Wang Xian). The Qingbaijiang Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Chongqing was successfully put into operation on the 10th, which is the second water-based green comprehensive service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Qingbaijiang Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan was officially put into operation on the 8th.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

至此，水上绿色综合服务区已覆盖长江上、中、下游。交通运输部长江航务管理局副局长邱健华介绍说，此前，湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏等省份已在长江中游、下游建成运行10个水上绿色综合服务区，得到了广大船员的认可，为推进长江航运高质量发展发挥了重要作用。

ASSISTANT: To this point, the water-based green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The Ministry of Transport's Yangtze River Navigation Administration Bureau deputy director, Qi Junhua, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built and put into operation 10 water-based green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which has been well received by the majority of ship crews and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

水上绿色综合服务区全覆盖是长江绿色航运建设的又一里程碑事件，长江船舶污染物接收、航运服务能力得到显著提升。据介绍，水上绿色综合服务区是为广大船舶、船员提供全方位生产、生活服务，帮助广大船员解决“急难愁盼”问题的重要设施。

ASSISTANT: The coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the green voyage along the Yangtze River, which significantly enhances the receiving capacity of ship pollutants and the service capabilities of navigation. According to the introduction, the water-based green comprehensive service area provides comprehensive production and living services for all types of ships and crew, and is an important facility for helping seafarers solve the urgent and difficult problems they face.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此次建成运行的长江上游两处水上绿色综合服务区，集生活服务、生产服务和政务服务为一体，以绿色环保为主题，以船舶维修与船舶应急救援服务为特色，实现港内船舶“一次靠泊、多项服务 ” ， 将使得常年航行在长江的船员工作更高效、生活更便捷。

ASSISTANT: This is the translation from Chinese to English:

The two water-based green comprehensive service areas built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River this time, integrate life services, production services, and public services into one body, with green environmental protection as the main theme, and ship maintenance and emergency rescue services as their special feature. They aim to provide "one-stop docking and multiple services" for ships in the port, making the work of sailors who regularly sail on the Yangtze River more efficient and their lives more convenient.
