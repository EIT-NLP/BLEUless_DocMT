The product cost less than 20 euros. The fee corresponds to 40% of the product value.
I am a large customer of #PRS\_ORG# and therefore it is not a problem for me. I just need a number or an instruction on how to address the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€.
I find this very annoying. Must I cancel the order and place a new one for a better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I believe that it is generally not appropriate to expect children to take on a parenting role for their younger siblings. However, I also think it is beneficial for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings to some extent.
Looking briefly, helping briefly, bringing the bottle, etc. So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they are still able to take care of themselves, I don't see a problem. If your K1 spends the short time alone and it's okay for him, that's fine.
You can best estimate whether it suits your children. It is not that he should wind K2 and accompany them for hours while they fall asleep.
It is legally questionable. Perhaps the statement of the psychologist is also true.
"Because if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether that's a risk you're willing to take is, of course, up to you :)"
Please help me find the title of a book! I remember reading a crime/thriller novel a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't seem to remember the title anywhere. Maybe someone here knows something about it...
The story is about fear and how to overcome it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by drowning himself in food and going to his predator enclosure.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, gets in touch with the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety disorders. The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear of fire and ends up at this therapist's clinic.
There are more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the location of each suicide and document it, and then post the photos on the internet. Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist is running an underground therapy group where patients are given a chip that suppresses an anxiety center in the brain, and they are ultimately forced to confront their fears in the most extreme way possible.
A woman jumps out of the window, another one kills herself intentionally. This will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the clinic that had a fire. That is the basic plot, and I am pretty sure that the book was written by a French author/authoress.
If this story is known to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh no, I don't have the password for the WLAN available. I need to contact my husband.
But it can take a while. What steps should I take afterward?
Is it also possible to receive a refund for the price difference?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter unter dem Daumennagel Kind, vier Jahre, hat über die gesamte Länge Holzsplitter unter dem Daumennagel (Außenseite).
Have tried to pull him with a pincer. Very difficult to grasp.
Did not work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left. Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, which allows it to be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 Decoders are available with all common interfaces and come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker, as well as a sound capsule building kit. Like all members of the family, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder.
He masters the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, decoders automatically register at an appropriate digital central station. It controls all DCC programming modes and, thanks to RailCom®, compatible central stations can read the CV values on the main track.
For central units that can only program CVs up to 255, there are helper registers. Motorola® users can benefit from up to 28 speed steps at 255 addresses.
Three additional Motorola® addresses enable the execution of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the honorable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible centrals. The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes Märklin® braking tracks just as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC System.
The braking with DCC brake blocks or with direct current is also possible. In addition, it also works with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC-pendelzugautomatik enables automatic pendling between two railway stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on analogue direct-current and alternating-current tracks.
After my coupon cannot be extended due to a complaint that has not arrived with me, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere where customer friendliness is higher and I don't have to waste my fingers just to reach nothing!
What should I do with this number then?
Due to Omikron: Johnson plans to accelerate the booster campaign Always new Omikron cases are causing politics and science in the UK.
Until New Year's Eve, therefore, all qualifying adults in England should receive an invitation to be vaccinated. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make faster progress with the COVID-19 booster vaccinations due to the rapidly increasing numbers of the Omikron variant.
Adults in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, said Johnson in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening. So far, the target date was set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing an emergency due to the Omikron variant, so it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccine protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the vaccination level could be increased with a third vaccine dose. "Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, an additional 1,239 Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total number to 3,137. Compared to the previous day, this represents an increase of 65%. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent out a job application.
Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email. I will respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
"I have no idea how to write this email right now. Can someone please help me?"
I am a foreigner and I do not want to step on the toes of any officials. Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them are going.
Only one thing that I bought today doesn't work.
It is obvious that the chair had an invisible defect when it was sold. How can a cushion defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS\_ORG#. That works but has been around for about ca.
14 days no more. Therefore, I have always bought the last books on the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8 more, but there were none left.
Now they are available again and I would like to ask if you could add two chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content Warning: I will be writing here about domestic violence in detail.
I have to write something from my soul. I am 21 years old and I often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims cannot or do not want to help themselves, or we think we cannot help them. I am certainly aware that we cannot do everything and that it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I cannot do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation with the perpetrator far beyond sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them. I do not know what the reason is, perhaps it is fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, sometimes even close to tears, is that it is all worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they do not have to simply accept violence.
Often, I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. It will never be easier.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What is the series about "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing design: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we excited about the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster of MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim At least youngster Johannes Patrick was left.
Nothing again: For the second time within less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, she did not lay down - but rather became even more agitated given the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone was not enough to disappoint, it was rather the manner of the performance that failed to live up to expectations.
A substitute statistic expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quote amounted to just 13 percent, 4 goals (all scored by young Johannes Patrick) in 31 attempts - any more questions? John Patrick's answer was: "We weren't concentrated enough after our victory in Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, moving the ball. Quite differently, his counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted: "A great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like being in front of 10,000 people. There were only 750 spectators allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made the most of it.
Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led his team's play. "The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim.
During Patrick's team's performance, even the high performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came close to eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
Along with Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points. Fortunately, there was plenty of time left for arguing.
Already on Wednesday (7:00 PM), the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg before then.
We had earlier a different email address, but I have changed it.
Yes, I have already registered a few months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were denied.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have therefore contacted them again. We originally reported ourselves already a half year ago.
Always as if peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59. He can charm his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to perform. Actually, Max Raabe was supposed to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But nothing comes of it. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official order" to curb the spread of the Corona virus.
Other planned appearances by him during the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de). The artists plan to make up for the already postponed 2020 dates due to the pandemic from January onwards.
Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and happily since he was a young man. He studied opera singing in Berlin and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer thinkable from the current German-speaking music landscape. With the program "Good day, dear happiness," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of furniture wood in advance? It could be combined with existing furniture and so we could control whether it matches in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only sew the cover, but I can't turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing The new Federal Minister of Housing Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large apartment complexes, as it has been demanded in a referendum in Berlin.
"With expropriation, no new apartment is created, it only changes the ownership structure," Geywitz said in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing corporations, by the way, is actually the best protection against monopolistic tendencies. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission to deal with the consequences of the people's vote.
But if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz just concluded talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limit on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rental index.
I will speak with the justice minister to implement it as soon as possible. If the rental market does not improve, "we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and only realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in the payment process. Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again? Or if it will come again at all?

Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut myself on the finger. That is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky. A devastating storm system has drawn numerous tornadoes across the United States.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be mourned. The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On the night before Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe destruction in the United States and may have claimed up to 100 lives. The storms left a trail of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of Kentucky, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everywhere the tornado had swept through, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - all gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is difficult to imagine that it is even possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official numbers increase hourly.
Hello, I have just seen that Vitrine #NAME# is out of stock. That is very unfortunate.
Will it still be produced? Or has it been completely removed from the catalog?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
Until when should you report? If the delivery cannot take place in my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return, and I would like to inquire if it has been received or processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans while the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, Austrian companies have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
To make matters worse, they are on the same line as the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today demanded financial incentives for vaccination. Even the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is intended to increase willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has changed jobs over which he has complained. This does not improve his situation compared to yours.
Waiting and drinking tea. It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old place and was looking for something else. You can do that too.
And that he didn't find you attractive back then: well, he didn't find his job attractive either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation into account. That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own campaign Boron to greet!
I am currently guiding a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Dragon's Pass" and I want to seamlessly lead my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players. We are playing DSA 5.
The great bow has been made, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been thought out, and now I am here, writing the starting adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes have to transport a wagon full of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further development of the story will take place there. A group of goblins will ambush the hero a few miles from the village and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the ability to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, taking action, threatening, recognizing the danger early, which also applies to the players. Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and sabers.
Unnoticed, goblins lie in wait for the heroes in a narrow path and flank them with three bows on either side, armed with arrows, while two more use spears to stop the wagon. If the heroes lose the battle, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be unconscious and subsequently found by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf, and healed. The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his knights and helps the heroes in battle. The cart is still there, everything is super.
How appropriate is the Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the Encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The group of Goblins will play a crucial role later on, so they are not just cannon fodder.  Note: I had not anticipated so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely consider many of your ideas and now have more confidence in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again. And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Therefore, I would like to send it back anyway.
Can you then let the return labels come, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

I'm frustrated with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased over the course of the season, so I want to vent a bit in this post.
Firstly, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the race caused the schedule to be far behind schedule, the last ten minutes and the championship decision could still have been shown.
It seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else must be restricted, so Sky DE probably didn't have a choice. It's still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race until the end.
Despite a small compliment, the commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the severe accident well. Then, there was again a rule ignorance among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag in F1.
Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both Hamilton and Verstappen only made the decision to allow Verstappen to change his tires after receiving relevant radio messages about this topic. At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 at a pay-TV channel. It is not the first riddle that now becomes possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL much better, even seriously.
In addition, there are constant jokes that both appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee by the equally clueless reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter particularly causes a lot of chaos in the commentary, as he clearly does not take it seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over on Sky. In the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear from F1TV after the race, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these channels make less advertising than Sky, and that as a free TV channel. Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very scarce and full of repetitions. In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit the F1.
Ironically, RTL makes a better job of the four races they are allowed to broadcast, except for the advertising. So, at least, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.
For here: #PRS\_ORG#-pendulum lamp, brass and multicolored glass x 1.
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and has not been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and have not received a response.
The first lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, and she has never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 2019. One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric has a hole at the front part of the chair).
I request support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air pump.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us. Look at the end of the offer in the table.
Here you can compare the performance. If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire systems with them.
Does one have a large aquarium? Pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable for connecting multiple outflows. The MK series has 1, 2, or 4 outlets, depending on the model. However, fan pumps are also available in the series to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar to name. The MK series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very easy. The fan pump is connected to an exhaust duct using a 4/6 mm air hose... and it's ready to go.
The fan pump should be at the same level or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan pump is placed lower than the water level, a check valve should be inserted between them.
Simply cut the air hose and place the ventilator in between. This would prevent water from flowing backward, which would cause the water in the basin to be sucked out through the pump...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should, like other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate a processing time of 3 days on eBay, packages are packed daily and picked up daily as well. Everything runs smoothly and quickly while on the road.
We just want to take a step back so that no one is upset, just because it took a bit longer than usual. It would be so, not everyone has an understanding of all the employees who also work in the shipping business... of course, here the Corona doesn't stop either.
Please do not rate me negatively just because the delivery has been delayed, this is solely due to the parcel services. Of course, people like to complain about these services, even though we are currently saying...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally. Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Is it also possible to order the legs in a bright color?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV moderator into space The daughter of the first US American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers have embarked on a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The start and landing of the around ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the freshly decorated astronauts upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were on the journey for ten minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of Alan Shepard, who was launched as a NASA astronaut in 1961 and for whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honored guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much each of them had paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded him of the mission of her father after the short flight. He had to work hard and make everything himself during his missions.
She was simply swept along, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic.
"He would like to return to space as soon as possible," said the moderator. "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies mostly automatically. The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was braked by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: At the first one in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board himself, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second one in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was present, who became famous worldwide with his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without consideration of the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should glow in a single color permanently or cycle through its entire color palette. When faced with a color change, the light stone retains a light color for around a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color tone.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp protects itself all year round in the open air. Even in a snowy environment, its light shines particularly well - only with shortened light duration should be counted when the days become shorter.

"Perfect, that's exactly what I need :) do I need to provide anything else? You only need the tracking number in my email?"
Someone who works or studies biochemistry I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the field itself quite interesting. Also, being in the lab does not bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical course).
I have of course also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at the time I also thought that I would definitely continue studying until my doctorate and that I would find a job afterwards. However, at the moment doubts are coming to me, especially depressing me about the career prospects.
On one side (Studycheck etc.), one hears constantly about great job opportunities and the profession being highly sought after. On the other side, one hears constantly about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would be really interested to know:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
1. What have you studied/which training have you completed? 2. Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering breaking off my studies in 2022 and becoming a specialist IT technician instead.
If you have any experiences to share, please feel free to write about them :)
Extra stress before holiday and festive weekends This topic came up last week with me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax. That's why I'm posting this now.
Not only before big holidays like Christmas, there is a lot of stress in our operation. It seems that there is also a lot of stress before weekends and public holidays.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Aufstieg" in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a half-official bridge day.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend at home. So, what did last week bring?
Stress everywhere. So many emails that had to be dealt with before takeoff, tasks here and there, everything *absolutely* necessary before the long weekend.
"Because... yes, because? Because "next week then" sounds so long after so much time and that shouldn't be the case?"
Or is it because people take everything so seriously in a shortened week that they want to accomplish as much as in a normal week? Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also incredibly exhausted.
What is the purpose of this self-imposed fasting during holidays? Why do we still have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all completely independent and on top of that. My question is simply: Are we the only ones like this, the Swiss?
Is this our reformed-evangelical style? Or do you know it in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't even bought any gifts yet.
"The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer of Hit Radio FFH. She will align herself with the festival by baking and basting with her son Plätzchen.
"I love it," said Catterfeld. But before the sensible days, she still had a lot to do: "For the first time, I haven't received any gifts yet. I have to get rid of it now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moulting and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NEKTON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage. The majority of feather defects that occur in bird keeping are solely due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage. For an efficient metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during molting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein supply and/or inadequate provision of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is cold water-soluble and can be easily administered through the drinking water or through the soft food.
Thank you, I have found it. Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are it. I have received a bed from you.
However, there was a problem with one part. The central beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these feet are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on them.
What are we going to do now? I can't build the bed.
The central beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are produced incorrectly. The central beam does not fit into the intended bracket.
I also receive new ones. When will they be sent out?
No, there are no flat ones. These are, according to the assembly instructions, the correct ones in terms of shape, they were only too thin.
But that doesn't matter. The important thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
"At my place, they are not flat. Could I receive them?"
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential building fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people were slightly injured in a fire in a residential building in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, an estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation. The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not rule out the possibility of an intentional arson.
The Criminal Police (Kripo) in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But then it comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo Ugur Sahin, the CEO of Biontech, published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously expressed himself publicly on his vaccination status. Now the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has motivated him to share, said Şahin. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccination against the coronavirus.
There were false informations on social media that I allegedly was not vaccinated. Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Sahin on Friday in a post on the LinkedIn network.
"For the past few months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors. So far, I have refused because the communication should not revolve around me."
But a call in the past week has changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 illness and has been hooked up to a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family have not been vaccinated, wrote Shahin. He did not ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust." Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he has not been vaccinated. However, the video was actually created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"I am currently not allowed by law to get the vaccine myself," Sahin said at the time. There is a prioritization of vaccination in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been suspended for a long time - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer: Thousands of people without power in several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia: no power and in many cases probably also no heating.
A fire had disabled a transformer station. After a fire with severe damage to a transformer station, thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without power for around 24 hours.
Through the fire, the lights went out on Friday evening for 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communities. The supplier Westnetz reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation on Saturday until the widespread disruption was finally fully resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered support in schools by providing care places and calling for neighborhood help.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their efforts. We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring efforts," said the head of the primary technology area, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will still take some days, as the Westnetz technicians were able to temporarily put some cables back into operation.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to company statements. Electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 PM according to Westnetz has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switching station in Neunkirchen-Seelscheid. There, extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply would be restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 23:15 hours, even the last ones affected by the outage have had power. Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies have been in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood help after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It's important now for citizens to take care of their neighbors, especially older or lonely people, and to inform the local fire stations if help is needed," said Sebastian Schuster, district administrator (CDU), after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. Additionally, temporary care places were established in schools for those who could not take care of themselves or required power-dependent medical equipment or were dependent on medical care. According to official statements.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it and pay in euros? It is the daily cover #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the substructure on the tabletop. It's a custom #NAME#.
There are three versions of this text. We wanted to use table plates with a diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today, my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I cannot collapse it and thus shorten it. Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the purpose. I would appreciate a feedback.
Yes, that's really easier! Then let's do it that way!
Can you send me the return shipping label via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I did not restart the E-#PRS\_ORG#. Should I do it now?
I find such a low discount almost insulting. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic combined: Riiber wins The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to concede defeat once again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a significant lead after the ski jumping event.
Return of the order number #NUMBER# When will the money be refunded to my account?
Yes, we both have made some changes and are using version 4.5... it could be that they have already heard of the problem.
I have directly bought a book with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be working. When I try to open it, the message comes, "ups!"
This document cannot be opened. The file may be faulty. Please report it to the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now what? I have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the parts with a little soap and water, rinse with clear water, and dry them. Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup. The first stroke on the component.
Draw the brush evenly stroke by stroke. The slight overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This can create unrealistic-looking areas.
A model is not a garden fence. Start with the bright colors.
The dark colors could otherwise shine through later. Metallic tones and colors come to an end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, unpleasant metal streaks may occur when they mix with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve a faithful appearance through the use of decals or peel-off images. From national emblems on aircraft to ship names, from trim strips and license plates on automobiles: decals give the model the final polish.
Please bring the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible. Aircraft cockpits can be easier to decorate before they are installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool, such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks, is time, patience, and a steady hand when applying decals. Cut each required decal individually and arrange them as needed.
Decals are also known as water slide decals, because you moisten the back side of them with water until the carrier paper becomes dark. Then you slide the picture only a little bit from the paper and place it on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you are holding the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Note: Always check first if the image is sitting correctly before you completely peel it off the paper, so it does not stick, wrinkle or even tear.
Excessive water absorption with a household towel. Caution, not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the place where I left off. On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Can I receive this via email? Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in 3 separate packages with me.
Thank you very much! Then I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned.
Can I get it back problem-free?
Children's wish treatment with PKV / What is a "insurance case"? Hello everyone,
We were some time in child welfare treatment, now when it comes to billing with the health insurance company, it suddenly turns sideways. One after the other:  * Wir waren einige Zeit in Kinderwunschbehandlung, jetzt als es um die Abrechnung mit der PKV geht, stellt diese sich plötzlich quer. * We were some time in child welfare treatment, now when it comes to billing with the health insurance company, it suddenly turns sideways.
We had applied for the Kinderwunschbahndlung in advance at the PKV and received the promise of up to 3 attempts. The attempts were not restricted in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was accounted for with the PKV. Some time later, we tried for a second child and underwent two (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet account for these with the PKV.
We requested again the cost coverage by the PKV and were granted again 3 more attempts. After some additional attempts (we have conducted more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive ones should be covered by the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to cover 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first promise fall away. The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the terms and conditions (AGB), "The insurance case begins with the healing treatment, it ends when treatment need no longer be required." Here are some questions for the experts in the round:
* Who has the right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (there are 5 attempts to be reimbursed)? * Should the PKV have pointed out to us that with a birth the further attempts fall away?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? Infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) will not be cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can reach them best?
Okay. We won't be placing any more orders with them.
If they add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer. Feel free to pass this information on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the return was initiated and now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first. I can't really do anything about it if the wardrobe is completely destroyed when it arrives at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague has written. It is clear and distinct that the repayment was initiated, and I have not received any repayment per #PRS\_ORG# yet.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do this anymore. No, the defect has only occurred after a few months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they should not sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty of 24 months applies.
No, I am not able to obtain a different type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company as is.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products being advertised with additional hooks that we can unfortunately not find with you?
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films  What exactly is a low-budget film? There is no general definition with exact budget limits.
According to Wikipedia, a **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture that is shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
There are plenty of lists of low-budget films on the internet, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you about it? And what might not appeal to you at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully equipped two apartments with your furniture. I would like to ask for the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is this now also reliable? Thank you.
With friendly greetings, there is no telephone number; a chat where one has to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...I will give up soon because it simply does not work here. Hello.
The European Union can declare a "partial victory" in its conflict with the Belarusian regime, according to political expert Raphael Bossong. However, this victory will come at a high cost for the EU.
The costs are very high and mean massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd). The EU has not solved the conflict sustainably, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This state of suspension - Belarus is not quite small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The way people are treated at the border is not in harmony with the European Convention on Human Rights, according to Bossong.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by certain EU governments. Since the EU as a whole has not decided against it, this comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union at the same time. "It can apparently not prevail if a member state insists on doing its own thing," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border protection agency, access to its borders.
In addition, the EU pays a further price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A basic consensus on asylum policy would be impaired, as the slogan "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at crossing the border.
According to statements by Poland's Border Guard, migrants have attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus again. 55 migrants were arrested in the night from Saturday to Sunday and taken back to the border, said a spokesperson for the authorities on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly attacked by migrants with stones near the village of Czeremsza. According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months, or attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly sealed off border crossings according to press reports. The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that transport migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving. The most effective element of the EU's response, according to Bossong, was the pressure on the airlines.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination, with tough bandages and extraterritorial sanctions to operate. Minsk must also consider the domestic costs.
The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly passes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes has filed a protest after the controversial Formula 1 finale. According to Mercedes, Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an objection. The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety-Car phase, when he allegedly overtook illegally. A second appeal was filed against the classification at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed correctly. Verstappen overtook Hamilton on the last lap in the Mercedes and won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, in which the Dutch driver had overtaken the car in front of him.
I will check it. I will speak with the bank and report back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag The Europa-Park, named after the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and permanent card holders of the Sports Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day. Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains were lit up with red and white lights on this day. Foxy, Ed Euromaus, and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesligist and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it was again shown how well the partnership fits.
"Shining fans can be seen having fun together on the roller coaster, and that confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

I submitted the contact form to return an article yesterday, but I have not received any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your clumsy chat and cheaply delivered junk from China. Your mistake, which you should correct and not all from our household.
Contacted Frau #NAME#. I cannot chat with them every day.
We talked yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# would receive an email with a 60 Euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return shipping label. However, this email has not yet been received.
The package wants to be delivered to #PRS\_ORG# today. Please contact me.

Sorry, but just because he says he is not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything. It's like when a far-right politician says he has nothing against immigrants.
Neither of you will admit it, but Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should just let it be. Yes, wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the theory of evolution is simply lost. Maybe God created everything.
But once you become a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense. And with that, you are a science denier and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of vision, the magnifying glass should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically planar-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the magnifying glass practically without distortion and color aberrations even in the edge zone.
Often, lenses are marked with magnification values. However, these values only apply under specific conditions that rarely correspond to the actual usage conditions.
To make the most of your loupe, please note the information in the "Technical Data" table (see instruction manual in the packaging). Light reflections occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including eyepieces.
By using an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When used under optimal conditions - with the loupe right in front of the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations during the Christmas tree sale.
Once, a man even had to drive home alone without his partner because they couldn't agree. He plants about 2000 pieces every year for that.
During that time, the 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations. That makes the pre-Christmas time always a bit funny, he says.
And what about the discount coupon? Otherwise, I'll be gone as a customer!
At least, I received a defective delivery and now I have to pay the full price for it. Then I will evaluate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name. In German, an equivalent might be something like "Dreher," which certainly doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with fiber optic cable + Devolo DLAN/Magic  We have had a new fiber optic cable connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am currently having problems building a stable Wifi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly with a few exceptions, receiving and transmitting at 50 Mbit.
The new fiber-optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to it, receives these as well. However, the other DLan module, which sends WiFi, does not receive the full 500 Mbit anymore, but the amount received decreases the further I am from the module (so use a power outlet that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet is now even slower with the new fiber-optic connection on the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than DLan, but there were also comparable losses here. Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optic cable?
And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to rewire LAN cables in the house.
I am truly desperate, which is why I have created an extra account here. Therefore, I would be even more delighted by a response.
When it's time to change the current account Who would have thought that now would be the first rest at the current accounts, it is disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm with various tricks from their customers the fee increases of the past, the negative interest rates also continue to fall. For example, the Deutsche Bank was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the freebet and even quadrupled it for Tagesgeld accounts. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the corporate division of Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for Tagesgeld accounts.
Meanwhile, these lower freebet rates apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request. Not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers."
The Commerzbank has already gone below a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the limit of 50,000 euros at ING Deutschland. The popular direct bank DKB has reduced its interest-free periods in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have already reached a limit of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox. Even the Sparda-Bank Berlin has arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which have even been granted legal rights in the first instance before the Landgericht Berlin against this regulation.
Banks are currently discussing whether institutes should create provisions - in case the upper instances declare negative interest rates in principle as unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.
A table plate for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is that for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston has a whole beauty army. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley journey. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of their appearance.
Well, so Aniston, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, correctly read: a SINGLE chip from the bag). That the hearts of both female and male fans still fly to her equally is actually a wonder.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck with love - and is still searching for the great love. And she has removed the desire for a baby from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. This hurt her.
The people who asked had no idea what was going on with me personally, medically, why I couldn't. It was really hurtful.
Stay hopeful that success and fame will bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Räikkönen must retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it.
After a driving error and a minor tire contact, Kimi Räikkönen had to stop his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after only a few laps. It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
For his final race, his wife Minttu and their two children traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Raikkonen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 while driving a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position, and finished 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins two-man bob - Sport The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I have calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg. At first, he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, in which he moved from third place to first.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove with 0.30 seconds on Sunday to a larger lead. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third place went to Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We went for a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also scored his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after finishing second in the previous race. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he did differently, then I would also do it that way," said Lochner. Nolte wins at home - podium for Jamanka.
Laura Nolte achieved her third season win in the two-woman bob at home. After finishing only in fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to the World Cup victory with her pusher Deborah Levi on Sunday, contributing to the German triple success.
Two-man bob Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. She achieved both her Olympic qualification and her first podium finish in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki finished in third place with Leonie Fiebig. For me, it was super cool to finish on the podium for the first time in the World Cup. I am super happy that Mariama is joining me.
I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the starting point, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized, "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot of stuff around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not entirely error-free trips, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I can buy it now!!! What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay it, so I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time to do so.
And now it was said that he was expired, which made me very angry. Look at the chat, it was about the Asare seat.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently reduced :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th? There was nothing on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Was was gestern von Ihrer Kollegin abgenommen wurde, ist heute ein Problem.
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered item.
But we still want the shelf module, it's a new and undamaged one, and we don't want to cancel the entire order.
Only today, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear girls and women,
I have something I simply want to write and perhaps it will resonate with someone - or maybe not. I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't cry or goes to kindergarten, he is essentially my child.
My friend (who has been together since 6J) is sick, has a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). I visited him yesterday because I also have emotional needs and I want to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with his shower (because my hand is in a band due to a burn). He is also cold and we currently see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) which makes it difficult for me with my needs for affection and love.
My dog has just had an upset stomach, and I have cooked for him. Now he is lying in his cozy blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and stroked him. I live alone with my sister and mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have to do some homework, which we of course divide between us. But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) illness is currently set up very well, I am halfway through my therapy and I am making progress. Not perfect, but I am making progress and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (for myself), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and the day after tomorrow, I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little bit. And next week, I have an oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no space left in my head.
Also geht meine Woche so: Nur noch bis übermorgen, dann ist Wochenende. Aber danach geht das ganze ja weiter?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the holidays.
Only until the weekend. Only until...
And so it goes on forever. I believe I'm just so stressed that I need these mental references, otherwise I'd pack it all in.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't seem to do it any other way... Is it the same for you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work. Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even express it in words.
I'm not sure if I would have survived otherwise. I think it also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and there is a tablet impression. With the first delivery, the color was exactly as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!! What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, will I get another color or something?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26, #NUMBER#. Otherwise, twice.
Confirmation was not given.
It was completely different: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and for them, it is just another subject like math or geography. For me, it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always believed in something.
How do you feel about it? Perhaps you can also tell me about it from the perspective of your work or study colleagues, with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate them. There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity. What would make someone want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Culture, to preserve or something like that? I hope the question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?  I would be happy to write in English, as I understand it well. This has been going on for a very long time, and I would prefer to avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a prompt response, at latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Please help me find a movie, dear people.
I am looking for a film from my childhood (I am 24). I believe it is a film for teenagers.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern world (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it anyway in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a story ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the Empire of the Dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can continue to live. I believe that the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers will fight against each other. If this statement means anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept only on her stomach from Week 1. Fast forward: she's still alive :D
Relax. Children are capable of much more than one might think.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly toys, often go in and look, but no minute surveillance. That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress.
No pillows. Ah, and ours never had a sleeping bag, but always a blanket.
Watch your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it stand up from the belly? Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
You can infer from this that everything is in order. We have all grown up and when my husband was born, it was the norm to put the kids to sleep by laying them on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already "Stammkunde" at your store and have already purchased many articles. But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already contacted a colleague of yours yesterday regarding my wardrobe, which arrived the day before (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit into the cabinet. Please contact me as soon as possible.
The drawer is currently not usable.
To make it clear. RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
"It's just that the politics of this sender are now under everyone's sauce. Just about every format is sponsored (ok), but then they still go on a big begging tour."
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "One wants to be 'no running billboard'."
What is this now? A 0815 advertiser trying to sell his merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people. A crook who lacks empathy and tries to make a profit by renting out exploded rooms.
How should I find all of this good? Ring if it pleases you, I find it terrifying.
Please call me back, as my delivered wooden table is defective. The body of the table is broken due to the damaged delivery of the #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort during stomach pain or simply for cuddling - My little warm friend is versatile in use. Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for pleasant warm applications, as cherry kernels absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven. The soft fabric makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the children feel secure, even when they are not feeling well.
The cranberry-patterned cushion with zipper is suitable as a warm-up cushion for the following application areas: Before heating the cushion on unusual odor, stain or branding, check for its presence and dispose of it immediately if it is present.
Please remove the inner pillow from the packaging to warm it up beforehand! In the microwave at maximum 300 watts for up to 2 minutes (note from the microwave manufacturer!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it! Then lay the inner pillow back into the cover.
At the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation at the surface, which disappears with repeated applications. Always adhere to the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy inputs can lead to damage (fire and burning hazard!).
Before heating a kiss in the microwave, check with the manufacturer's instructions whether the heating of corn products is allowed. After the warm inner cushion is put back in the cover, please check the temperature of the kiss on your elbow to see if it is suitable for babies (maximum 43 °C).
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic inflammatory or feverish diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood ecchymoses, and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity. If you have existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes, or tumor diseases or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If stitches have opened up and kernels have come loose, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and make them inaccessible to children. If the product is applied to babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the baby during application should be regularly controlled to exclude overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority in the country where the user is located. The product is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in a machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone. For Ingolstadt, it's also not going well under the third coach.
Joy in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, happiness in Hannover over interim trainer Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Yesterday evening, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and approximately 3 years old) was no longer charged through my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago and it should still work. I thought that a power cord alone would be enough to operate it.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop does not start even with the power cord inserted. Therefore, I have disassembled the battery, but nothing happens here either.
Do you have any ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop on the internet?
Is there anything else broken? Thank you for your help!
I would like to book the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to the room. How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat height is...
Often on tour and still a lot of equipment? With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20-liter storage capacity can also accommodate larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored using the polished FlexFold dividers. And what you still need from everyday objects is kept well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to practical access points in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design is literally in it - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
It works with two options: conventionally through the flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection, which has already proven itself in Messenger bags. There is a metal locking hook in the closure flap, with suitable anchor bars on the front side of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are actually 4 D-rings, securely riveted, into which the locking hook can be inserted when the backpack is full. If the backpack is full, you simply take the top ring, which is empty if the backpack is not full.
In addition, the flap closure and hook are also magnetic. This allows the backpack to be closed reliably without having to insert the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail significantly increases the everyday usability of the backpack: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday objects or travel luggage with you. In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more about this below) and thus easily separate the photo equipment from the everyday objects - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access, for example, the camera equipment in the right compartment, while everyday items stay safely in the left compartment and don't get in the way. Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with that.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is also completely made of 100% recycled, waterproof nylon, the contents will stay dry even if it's raining in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I waited in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# confirmed the order for me yesterday.
Contact by the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table has been announced. So far, I have not received any message.
I request immediate processing. I am now writing with the third support employee, and with none of them did I get further than the promise that I would receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom #NAME#.
It is clear when the wardrobe could be delivered again? Keeping him is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for the help.
Wishing you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher to me, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture item and not returned it. And I couldn't have known that the past year would turn out differently than expected, and I couldn't timely redeem and clarify it.
But the damage as a customer, I do not accept.
Reducing brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who knows how to assess reliability and safety when braking even under difficult conditions. Reducing brake discs are made of cast iron and are then mechanically processed (bored and cut).
All molded discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties, which are specific to certain discs and patterns. Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that is tailored to the pressing of the disc after the properties of the original assembly.
The tuned discs ensure high comfort and braking efficiency. Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of cooling the disc, where the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and brake blocks.
The aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the Pacific coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered shining rocks in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were delimited, tents were erected, and saloons and hotels almost emerged overnight. Everyone wanted to claim their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it meant: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the west and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that other pioneers have the same idea! You must outperform your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many ways to win. You simultaneously choose your actions, have to manage your resources and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage. With these buildings and the dynamic tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their selection is revealed, and they place their pawns on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock! This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players alternate performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The Printer turns at the beginning of every round to a new location and changes the available actions as a result. This continues until the Printer has moved five times, which means that each location has been covered once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where the players have to defend Coloma from an angry bandit attack. If the players have enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the cemetery. The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I take up to the dimensions 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm for the shipping method, product shipment (games included).
At everything else, usually DPD insured and with shipment tracking (games included, wrapped in bubble wrap and packing paper). If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a box within a box for an additional fee of 2 euros, so that there are 100% no printing defects.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately. > The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate about upbringing. Former patients and those with parental authority now level serious accusations against him.
Please bear with me, the film is difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
To our parents and other responsible parties, it must never, never, never be about power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
Translation:  Ugh, I'm still shivering.
Holtschek: Countries discuss elimination of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals The health ministers of the countries plan to decide on a nationwide elimination of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We need clarity quickly from the countries whether and when the testing obligation can fall for three times vaccinated people," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to the "Bild am Sonntag". The abolition of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive to be vaccinated," said Holetschek.
German to English Translation:  Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has promised to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on Tuesday. - AFP

Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can no longer process any purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#. Advertisement: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# page on the computer is going. I have updated my account details.
What could this be about?
What you describe is referred to as *Awareness*, or sensory perceptions under full anesthesia. These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most often, it is the hearing of sounds/voices that occurs, rather than the seeing of images, and the least often, the feeling of pain. For this topic relevant: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the birth to protect the child.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the induction of anesthesia. Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me correctly describes Awareness, but u/Nitemarex, by definition, had none. I mistakenly read their comment.
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ help us not.
These are legal warranty claims. At the very least, they should take back the defective chair.
This is not only a legal obligation, but also a standard in the eCommerce area. Please check again if you at least want to take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately. In doing so, we also lose some money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to. May I ask the question again?
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The shipping company is firm #NAME#.
I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I must cancel the order because I do not know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture to the first floor.

Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He was known for his work as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. Günther Rühle died at the age of 97 on a Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older." The shattering diary of a slow farewell from the world, which theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I testify here already my life's gratitude."

Rolled Beef Tips & Tricks I received some great tips for making the perfect goulash a week ago.
There was something at Christmas that was incredibly delicious and creamy! So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve. Tomorrow I will set a beef fond for that.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I do not have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What about the books, or how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English is not as good as it used to be, but I can still manage.
The issue is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
But so far, the money has not arrived with me. Would you please check that?
Where in the Lübeck space there is still Christmas roast left For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.

We reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube stage contributes significantly to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-controllers, you can set both the desired level and the harmonic distortion of your sounds. The amplifiers of the VT+ series also offer a unique POWER LEVEL-controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "Gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that one can even make a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator, when it gets unbearably loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a box simulation so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
To the AUX port, a CD or MP3 player can be connected so that you can jam to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate microphone.
If you want to spend a little extra on a VFS5 foot switch, you can call the sounds comfortably by foot, switch the effect blocks on and off, and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects "tap." This is basically essential for live use.
With its new power packs, VOX is taking another step into the future!
Have you seen anything like that with other lamps? If so, would it be possible for you to send the lamp back to me?
Is it too low for over a dining table? Then I would like to send it back.

And the wardrobe? Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a legacy or gift certificate. Under certain circumstances, I might be able to find a buyer for the furniture.
Only €1,000 for goods that I don't need would be too much.
I have just received my delivery and would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a Premium customer status at your company?
Iran is seeing progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement. According to Iranian statements, progress is being made in the negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be discussed on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri to the news agency IRNA on Sunday. This is a "positive and important development," as there was initially no agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a nearly week-long break on Thursday.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations. A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has surpassed Saxony - the free state is now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence.
As the only federal state, the value lies above the mark of 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence on Sunday above the mark of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but remained above the value of 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill COVID-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals. There may be reporting delays on weekends.
Additionally, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is not expected until early March, it may be possible until then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and give it to the post office, that's it or? here I don't have to do anything else click/enter/fill out anything?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to request that you cover the return shipping costs yourself.
The 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, a rudeness.
It's time for changes. ###Welcome to the Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
#Why is the post here? When one looks at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, one can determine: it is not extant.
We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the reason? Mostly, it seems to be related to dissatisfaction, how things have turned out here and how we generally feel uncomfortable.
In the last few days, it has become increasingly clear that many people here are still very excited about the upcoming MBundestag. #What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is being asked whether they want to keep this project alive. The spark came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and has found, simply put, a pile of broken pieces.
After some back-and-forth, several people from the community have found each other who want to rebuild the project. However, I would also like to expressly invite everyone to participate, only then can this project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server through this link.
Goals: * How should the Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing orders must be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited? * How do we create a fair voting system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten some things, which is not too bad, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide on the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/clumsy for it and is not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed it then, when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I have a full refund. This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the daily planner #PRS\_ORG# also come in a larger size, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee that the faulty cabinet will be collected promptly. And I kindly request that this be done now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the shelf as far as possible for pickup - they must clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how that can work. #PRS\_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for the assembly? How long would I have had to obtain it or make a decision about returning it?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan? Today, I had a conversation with a colleague that I enjoy.
You yourself have lived vegetarian for a while, and you currently eat meat very rarely. I myself was a vegetarian for several years before.
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that is that I have long thought that as a vegetarian I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction arose on their side, they defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and as vegetarians, they reduced animal suffering.
Now I wonder if my answer to "plump" was appropriate? How do you respond to this question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly put into a corner and conflicts arise without one wanting it. It greets a harmonious-loving vegan (;
It is clear that this is not an exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am scheduled to return the item on the assigned date, but #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up returns at the location. Unfortunately, I cannot be present at the location due to a funeral, so this cannot be changed.
Please assign me an alternative pickup time. I will be available starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue is equipped: 45,000 Euro subsidy from the state Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a subsidy decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new equipment vehicle of the Volunteer Fire Department Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnsteiner City Hall.
The total cost of the vehicle that has been in operation since November 2020 was 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in safety.
"I'm glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here," says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein. The equipment van will be used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks both on and under water in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, one permanently counts on increasing deployments: the boom of tourist shipping on the Rhine and Moselle as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read to 10% and then the problems started. I can't open the book.
I have followed your recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did not work. I am a bit frustrated because this whole action has already cost me a lot of time and I hope now for help.
Alright, so it is. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to the whole thing here, I have also spent almost a decade in state service in a similar activity, i.e. we were also weapons carriers in the executive, furthermore, I do not want to go into it! The question of right and left always seems to me to be very oversimplified.
Generally speaking, one should say that naturally, the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone. That naturally, even in a particular uniform and weapon carrier, people on the right might be attracted to conservatism should also be clear to everyone, as these people might have a hard time dealing with reality, naturally. Also, because you have, besides the average white person, nowadays many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and also homosexuals (and I mean now not the exaggerated feminine stereotype, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you), and also on these people, I must rely, because in the end, they might save your life or set something up for you.
But even these peripheral groups also represent, according to my experience, a conservative attitude, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less abducted by excessive left-wing politics, even though this politics supposedly fights for them or means to make it right for them, they simply want to be treated normally. Back to the right, of course, the police and the armed forces are also a cross-section of society, and there you will also find extreme right-wingers, but they openly express their opinions there or even openly plan any state-threatening plans, which is medially exaggerated and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even police officers and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or even politically incorrect. It's also possible that right-wing sympathizers will meet up and engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nevertheless, such things are well combated in my opinion, and political education and enlightenment are also opposed to it! Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is also good in my opinion, that we could hardly have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered from the German side. Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out. I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer deliverable. I have previously chatted with #NAME# about it.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or is this basket also available in Germany somewhere. I always find you as a partner company.
But there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part, which are filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with a thing for a longer time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but throughout my life, I have had more trouble than I would like to keep my household clean and organized permanently. There are always phases in which everything stays lying around, and sometimes it catches up with me, and I tidy up and clean.
But it is actually never like "that someone could spontaneously drop by." My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere, but mostly the household simply loses out against work and laziness.
The kitchen is regularly cleaned because we like to cook. Now, to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We haven't had any yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupying me for a longer time. Because for me, I don't have any motivation to do it, it just doesn't bother me as much as it could, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide a greater incentive or does one remain lazy? I am looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and anatomically pre-shaped cut offers maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and enables almost unrestricted movement freedom. Pre-shaping with special, deeper stamping at the joints for improved movement freedom (at arm and knee bends)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area by the Flex System 2 was increased by more than double to further enhance comfort. Nylon stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-formations in the lower back area and in the step ensure a snug, perfect fit. The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar spine area increases flexibility around the back closure and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body. A seamless, thin (-2 mm) gasket at the face near the hat increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate headgear).
Loose, the collar-mounted zone improves sealing with a fine-adjustable width setting by a flexible, gentle adhesive closure that does not adhere to the casing or the stitches. Double cuffs with zipper closure connect an unfoldable inner cuff with a soft, cashew-shaped outer cuff made of neoprene.
For increased elasticity and durability when pulling, a 45° indentation is made at the end of the inner lining. The neckline has a long zipper closure with an Elaskin reinforcement, providing an anatomical cut with increased comfort for the overall without a hood.
Long G-Lock P back zipper (overall without hat) with metal slider and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat Patent) zippers on arms and legs
Reinforcements made of neoprene at all ends of the clasp to prevent tearing when excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlap.
Edges of outer pockets reinforced for greater load-bearing capacity Edges of inner pockets embossed for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially during deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
"Career in social work - as someone with a self-unconfident personality disorder? I have a training in the field of software development and have been unemployed for about a year now."
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been contemplating starting over and studying social work. The problem is that I have a self-unsure (or anxiously avoidant) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
That means, roughly speaking, that I have no self-esteem and am accordingly shy. I have no problem talking to people on a practical level, but it is very difficult for me to engage in casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as aloof (which I believe has improved somewhat).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete working day is really like I imagine it to be, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet. The ÄVPS is already causing problems for me (emotionally) in my job now, because it always pulls me down when there is something to criticize in my code ("again, the simplest things are messed up") and it's hard for me to ask experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how to do it by now"/"he's holding me back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm underpaid" etc.).
I will likely have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
Have you already received the sofa? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup. What do you mean by "returning please"?
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, does the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book" appear?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein contained in the food is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual amino acids, which it then uses to build its own protein molecules, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and involve a particularly high demand for the entire organism of the animal.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it may cause disruptions in the breeding process. After the short-term administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be followed by daily vitamin supplementation with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 gram NEKTON-Bio per 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food. It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A peeled teaspoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regeneration is fully completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That is really very poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged when it arrived and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws,  Hello r/LegaladviceGerman.
I have the following problem. A walnut tree must be felled on our property.
Also, a request has been made to the community. An employee writes me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the bylaws.
But in the bylaws, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree. Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't receive any message, so I still have a sofo without using it.
Could you then offer me a bequest or a gift certificate? What were they more expensive?
Yes, I believe that's correct. The question is whether I can pay in euros and have the deed delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Emergency Report: Serious Traffic Accident in Selb  A serious traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the exit ramp Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As currently reported by the police press alarm (14:03 Uhr), a car came into the oncoming lane while overtaking. There are injured people.
Okay, I understand. Thank you again that it was so easy!
First of all, happy Christmas to you!  Now, let's talk about career advice and ideas for the future.
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about. Before I go on ... briefly: I need advice and the best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a newcomer. Originally, I studied something else and worked in that area (at least a little bit anonymously, I won't mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun. Eventually, I ended up in teaching and was sure that's what I wanted - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I Google other job postings" and it has been half a year.
At the paintings before, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref, after that I can always turn around. But now I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now it is vacation, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday was my holiday. I had free time.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment. Now, even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me. Basically, it's fun and from the outside, the ref also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I am completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already. I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had the freedom to take time off when I needed it, and although the work was somewhat boring, it was appropriately compensated and I accomplished something as part of a team rather than as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back at the same place in a year's time and be just as unfulfilled as I am now. You notice that everything is a bit chaotic, but perhaps you as outsiders have some advice or ideas on how to get out of this situation that I am completely finished with and start crying at the mere thought of it.
I will not make any decisions now, as I am feeling very emotional at the moment, which is likely to lead to nothing good. But perhaps your views can help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me. I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. We are presenting a brand new modeling engine with the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, which is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This partly relies on genuine analog circuits because these capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier better than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances just flow.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them to be. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for.
All guitarists dream of the power and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During a detailed analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the final stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, the Magic lose to the Clippers. The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also highly adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable Velcro closure components, it is tailored entirely to the needs of your photo equipment and is suitable for all types of cameras - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-format DSLRs. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible setup could be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and a flash unit. Larger DSLM cameras like the various models in the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 still have room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items.
Even drone pilots find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro drone including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island since Sunday.
Previously, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa, with 84 days. No reliable data are available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dared not make any predictions as to when it might end. The indicators point towards a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said Mariano Hernández Zapata, president of the island council, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE. Damages in millions.
In the three months since the eruption began, more than 1,000 degrees Celsius hot lava has destroyed almost 2,900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1,200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
Almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land masses were formed by cooled lava with a total size of approximately 50 hectares. The banana cultivation, which is of immense importance to the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly rely, was particularly affected. The cultivation was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption and now faces an uncertain future.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and additional areas were severely affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts Christmas is at the door, and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive quality combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension. Christmas belongs to the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
Therefore, it is all the more important to become conscious of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "society contract of natural peoples" that contributed to peace, can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life within the context of this tradition. How Nicholas became the Christ Child
Strictly speaking, it were the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with the giving of gifts. Before that, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas' Day in one way or another.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women at night to spare them from sinful lives. This unconventional form of giving gave rise to the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with gifts.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of mediators between God and humans as "holy worship." For this reason, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and thereby established a new line of tradition. The focus of gift-giving shifted towards Christmas Eve as a result.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only annoys the fewest people that the custom of St. Nicholas is still as firmly a part of the pre-Christmas season as the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession. Today, one finds everything from socks in front of the door and under the Christmas tree, to desired luxury watches.
Diversity in traditions in Christian countries sources confirm a tradition of giving on the feast day of Saint Nicholas since the 13th century.
With the Reformation, the day of giving gifts shifted to Christmas Eve. However, there is a festive confusion in all Christian-influenced countries about who will bring the gifts to the children now.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who in principle is a kind of Nikolaus, to whom some unique features have been assigned over time. This includes, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the somewhat stricter Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the witch Befana who is said to have guided them to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, mythical creatures sometimes bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought considerable fame. Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for delivering the gifts.

The police shot a suspected bank robber near the King's Palace in London on Saturday.
The police announced that callers had reported a man with a weapon had gone into a bank and a bookmaker's business. The man fled according to government statements in a vehicle that was later stopped by police.
There were shots fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background. There are several messages located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I will be immediately redirected to your site.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area, or stone garden. The light is simply placed and can be anchored with two earth spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery. Maximum light duration of 10 hours.
The robust plastic delivery is usable all year round in the outdoor area. In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with colorful light.
However, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The edge-less, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic shapes fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the grass, or in the stone garden. He also makes a good impression in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries. Just set the "Light Stone" on any sunny spot during the day.
Two included earth spikes provide a secure hold when needed. The matte white plastic housing is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colorful light. The battery is already charging when sunlight falls on the housing.
"Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically as twilight sets in; in which color, that's up to you: You have six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to white for daylight. The automatic shut-off also occurs once the battery charging stand has fallen to a predetermined minimum or it has become light again.
As soon as the sun comes out again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I have already done it several times, it doesn't work.

The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been further fundamentally improved. A variable and adjustable PWM frequency of 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a super-quiet operation, especially with bell-crank motors - the typical "humming" belongs to the past.
The torque control can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs. The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic measurement of the decoder at the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A motor current, even for older motors. Please use the eBay shopping cart so that the shipping costs are correctly combined.

Hello dear women's community,  I have a problem with pills and I'm not sure what to do. I've been taking them every day for a week now, but I still haven't had my period. Is this normal? I'm worried that I might be pregnant, but I'm not sure how to tell. Can you help me?  Sincerely, [Your Name]
I hope I'm doing everything right, it's actually my first post after a year. To my problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pain during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stay, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose for myself. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
During my last approximately two-year break from 0 to 100, I suddenly got explosive acne all over my body. It was so superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of pause, nothing has really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without any dyes, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me. My gynecologist unfortunately did not take me seriously and the dermatologist's appointment has not yet been scheduled.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, the love of one's skin is such a thing.
Had terrible neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread knötchenflechte and the topic of acne. I have also tried everything in terms of nutrition during my Christian illness and have remained on a sugar-free, milk-free, and low-meat mixed diet because nothing else worked properly.
It can also be good that hormonally there is just a worm in there, but if one wants to build everywhere like I do, one prefers not to search any further, otherwise everything goes wrong.
I had already written everything about her seminar o. ä. to her colleague and now I have lost the conversation and do not know what was answered to my concern.
I must work continuously and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check, if the money were there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.

In the name of the people: laypeople sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench in the courtroom.
But their judgment depends a lot on it, even if they don't wear a robe: Lay judges decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes to jail. Two of them report in a conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht an der John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately, I cannot access the customer account. Could you please send the invoice for order number #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have the option to keep it for so long.
We would use the table as if it were offered to us, as if it were ours.
Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the translation:  "Gerne, habe bereits im November den selben Sessel in Blau bestellt und auch erhalten. Daher, weil die so schön sind jetzt, einen in Grau."
Must the shelf be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
A 110-kV earth cable will be newly built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The plan approval decision of the government of Lower Bavaria makes the way for the construction to begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk now.
The approximately 7-kilometer long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a transmission tower of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part at our company so far.
The blue Betsell number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned to #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now? A beautiful start to the week!
You can forget about it, I have already explained it several times yesterday! It is a glass commode, and all the sides are inflated, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken.
The wardrobe is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to #PRS\_ORG# regulations. This means that the wardrobe cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request was made at #PRS\_ORG#, as it probably involves a general problem.

I have been in the ref since summer, and teaching makes me happy, but I currently have big problems with time-efficient planning of my geography lessons. Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the board, the textbook, and an OHP as media.
In school, I can also copy in black and white for free (which can be nerve-wracking for geography). I currently need very long to plan my hours.
We, for example, are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and at my place, basically every hour stands for itself. Essentially, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how to build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). I am not very satisfied with most of the tasks in the book Terra.
Therefore also the work sheets. Perhaps one day a geography teacher can teach me how to work efficiently with the book.
"Würde mich echt freuen" is a German phrase that translates to "Would really please me" in English.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. While I have actually chosen a new one from #PRS\_ORG#, I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for Christmas business. In most shops, only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered can enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and regrets sales declines. A possible solution has also been prepared.
The 2G rules according to the German Retail Association (HDE) harm the important Christmas trade for retailers. With non-daily consumer goods, there would be sales losses to be mourned, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively on the remaining days of the year. Many had already written off the Christmas business.
According to Genth, what was supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often just an empty hole without any ground. Retailers with 2G access restrictions reportedly lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's going well only in the food retail trade and in the online area. The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director. "2G shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel deployment. The bandage regulation must be approved nationwide, he demanded.
After that, each customer should only be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and should have access to all businesses with the band they receive on that day. Additionally, in retail, as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested), sample control checks should be sufficient.
Even the real estate company specialized in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, spoke of a difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona levels, and the sales at about 90%.
"These numbers will now fall securely in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approvals will be obtained for the centers.
The so-called "bracelet solution" is mentioned, where "visitors, for example, have to present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a bracelet similar to those in a club hotel - can enter all shops unrestricted." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error with the frame that was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
It looks unsightly. I would like to return the mirror and have already packed it back into the box and taped it up again.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for Dual-Balance construction, based on new, flat SMD -LEDs with high power and high color rendering. For setting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is used.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and tungsten. It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitively operable.
The lamp generates a very high light current with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker. The radiation angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Also, even in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances. You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on the film set and in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for the remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery scope) for the user's storage. The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the storage buttons, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons for a longer period of time, and it will be saved. The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when the lamp is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to a specific color temperature.
Working with batteries is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. This is due to the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries. These batteries are often already in the possession of photographers and cameramen (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check if the batteries have sufficient performance before setting - it is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in both display shows (left battery compartment upper display, right battery compartment lower display). Furthermore, it is of course possible to continuously supply the headlight with power through the supplied power supply.
The construction of the flash is very simple. You have a 16mm thread for attachment, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination can be reliably set using adjustment screws on both sides. It was also ensured that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a ball joint is included in the delivery. Great news is that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So can you transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to buy without any problems?
I'm sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, die wir schmeißen wollten": Frankfurt feiert nach torreichem Comeback gegen Leverkusen  What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last time the Hesse team won twice in a row, they seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga disaster. But then the SGE turned it around, shot off their frustration over a mediocre season start within an hour and won fiercely with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have achieved today," coach Oliver Glasner celebrated at DAZN and gave a "general compliment to everyone who was there."
At first, it looked like another dampener was needed for the Frankfurt players, who were still behind their expectations despite being ranked ninth. Patrik Schick had given Leverkusen a 2-0 lead.
What then happened, even impressed the SGE trainer. "As the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am absolutely delighted with the performance we have shown and, of course, with the result. Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to return to the field for the first time since the fourth game week and his recovered muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredibly big," said the 27-year-old, beaming with excitement as he looked at the result, particularly for the spectators. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
Glasner plans to keep the focus on himself for the upcoming tasks, but feels well-positioned regarding the personnel situation. It is exceptional that all players are fit in December and in top physical condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally. Now we want to "step by step proceed and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level."
The next game in the English week is already scheduled for Wednesday, as part of the away match against Borussia Mönchengladbach (8:30 PM, Sky).
I will receive a grade for the mail that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my part. I have tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and have it redirected, but there is no chance.
Can it be sent to me directly again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is resubmitted? Unfortunately, that would mean that I wouldn't order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Dampfer for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain Germany's handball women slipped after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks.
At the end of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection suffered a heavy defeat with a score of 16:32 (8:13) in front of 800 spectators in Granollers. The team must now run against the host country Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too cautious and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we must act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished second in Group III with 8:2 points behind Denmark (10:0).
It's unfortunate that we couldn't bring the flow with us. That was a bad game that we need to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, there must be a significant improvement on the upcoming Tuesday, to keep the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007 alive. The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We must now quickly look ahead." From the front to the back not at the height.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at their best at the start of this game. Poor shots and technical errors in attack, and gaps in the defense led to a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately on the job temperature and prevented with some parades worse. The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully completed a quick counterattack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make it onto the scene - and when they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game ended prematurely at 3:10 after 20 minutes due to an early start, as well as a hard foul by Mia Zschocke on her opponent, which resulted in a red card for her. However, she will be allowed to participate in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection start to play better, and they were at least within five goals until the break. The already quiet hope for a comeback after the change was gone after seven minutes with the score at 9:19.
The Greener-trained shooters again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent who counts among the medal contenders at the end of the season. As a result, the German team could no longer muster the necessary performance boost and left the court as a clear loser.
DACH Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions in the Christmas Season As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have captured St. Nicholas Day and are using it as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas season, Advent, St. Nicholas, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it then at home with you? How about your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is the most beautiful thing for children?
The translation of the text from German to English is:  "Stepfather's shoe cleaning? Plate baking?"
Decorations for trees? Will they be playing music?
Come Santa Claus, the Christ child, or is the gift from Oma and Opa? It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone gives themselves and around Christmas, it's hard to have a beautiful family time.
Is it now a fixed tradition, or even something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Please send me a transaction number, or otherwise, what could help with the transfer confirmation... etc.
I would like to give a discount code like #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers.
Is it going well with them?
The title exists before, I am active as a vaccinator in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these will soon be completed to a large extent, it goes partly to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally oriented (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination..."). Within my area of responsibility is the information for the vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulation and no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and potentially the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants. However, in vaccination teams, we often do not have a doctor present, but only pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the vaccine preparation, who are not allowed to administer vaccinations (should not?), so that I also have to perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberg knows the solution. What please is an "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, intense thinking has been aroused in the BR television show "Wir in Bayern". However, unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained unguessed by the callers in the series.
No, it was not a "nervous man". And also none, "who everything has to go quickly".
The people heard from the TV moderator that it was completely wrong. On which the man from Amberg provided the solution and probably also caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate residents.
"The wiper", the audience learned, "is a lap with which someone wipes the oven." Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been questioned as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar Mundart word "Houdern". With which a gap in education was closed - perhaps also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have been unable to purchase books for the past two weeks. After confirmation, the following error message always appears: "oops - something went wrong - try again later."
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# with the PC connected, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - is it really as safe as they say? I've been eagerly awaiting today, because I wanted to at least a little bit train for my upcoming cycling tour next week.
Said, done and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then what always lurks in every city center (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) happened.
Glassplitter on the track. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire didn't want to continue the rest of the journey on no account.
Since I couldn't really get an extra jacket and hose due to the day of the week, I had to turn around with half-hearted mood and take the first train home. It wasn't quite as bad as it sounds, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
But now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would extremely unwillingly have this problem repeatedly.
Now it was really not that bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had driven until 14:12 on the day I picked up the bike) were still there, and he had already described them as suboptimal because he had driven many years on them. But when I think that I still need to change the tires when I've driven 80-90km, I'm not in a very good mood :D
Now I have come into conversation with an older man at the railway platform, who surprised me by asking why I did not have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unbeatable. Now it all sounds very tempting.
But are these really so indestructible? I don't want to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed later.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment. That may also be available (apparently) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you generally advise me on tires for a racing bike?
The Swallow's side seems to be my absolute favorite! Would you recommend the Durano DD to me? Thank you in advance for the help and warm greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and collided with a median island, causing him to lose control and crash into the opposite lane, as the police announced.

Hello everyone,  Finally, we can announce that we will also be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which means that there is a higher planning effort involved and explains the short-notice announcement. BUT: At least three people will be present per switch, so we will be able to stream the Oscars 2021 with at least seven beans and hopefully thousands of you will be able to follow along!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we'll give everything to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will be around 0:30 when it happens. Prepare your drinks in advance, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
