Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

ASSISTANT: Gabba的双重电力故障解释和为什么可能再次发生

Gabba的电力故障风险是不太可能在下一个板球系列比赛之前得到改善的，因为板球管理机构正在等待有关2032年奥运会在该球场进行重大升级的详细计划。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

ASSISTANT: 来源告诉《时代》和《悉尼先驱报》，墨尔本是澳大利亚唯一一个主要体育场馆，其主要电力供应不足以为全球转播车辆和设备提供电力。在第四天的比赛中，墨尔本测试的主要和备用发电机故障了约25分钟。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 这是因为领土的基本功率需要用来供应加巴的照明塔 - 其中一个在2019年的Big Bash League比赛中著名的坠落 - 以及球场本身。因此，主播们从巨大的柴油发电机那里提供主要的电力供应，并计划从备用发电机中获取备用电力。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.

ASSISTANT: 然而，在比赛的第四天，主要发电机故障与备用发电机同时失效，导致两者都下线，并且造成了近30分钟的全部或部分广播图像和DRS的损失。NEP公司，为Fox和Seven提供外部广播车和其他设施的公司，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

ASSISTANT: 除了在阿德莱德的阿德莱德球场、墨尔本的MCG、悉尼的SCG以及霍巴特的贝尔瑞夫球场之外的其他地方，这些球场将提供主要的电力供应给广播员，留下一台柴油发电机作为备用电源。这种差异在过去曾引起主办商Fox Cricket的很大担忧，而在短王杯比赛中，由于减少的制作和技术人员数量，这种差异进一步加剧了紧张局势。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: 澳大利亚板球协会收到了福克斯公司的警告，警告他们在技术上更安全地选择在其他地方举办比赛，但如果比赛仍然在凯杭举办，那么在昆士兰允许进入的骨干团队中存在“巨大风险”。

The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough. Underlining that France is entitled to around 80 more UK licenses, a group representing fishermen in the key port of Boulogne-sur-Mer and others along the northern coast threatened late on Saturday to launch protests.

"Protests should be expected ... protests that will target British imports," the local CRPMEM fishing industry group for the Hauts-de-France region said in a statement. The group said its members were "exasperated" by the news of only 23 new licenses and felt "betrayed" by the European Commission, which could launch legal action against Britain over the issue.

The CRPMEM said the protests would be "in line with blockades of ports in Brittany, Normandy and the north of France which took place on November 26." On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.

ASSISTANT: CRPMEM 表示，抗议活动将“遵循在布列塔尼、诺曼底和法国北部的港口堵塞行动，于11月26日发生的情况。”在那一天，法国渔船简单地在加来、圣马丹和欧克兰港口阻止了渡轮和其他船只，同时也派遣了车辆来破坏通往欧洲隧道铁路连接的交通。
