The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the item's value....
I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer, so it's not a problem for me. I just need a number or instructions on what I should do with the package so that it can be tracked as a return from you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago for 249€. Today it costs 179€.
I find this really frustrating, to be honest. Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I also think it's generally not appropriate to ask children to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I do think it's good for older siblings to take care of their younger siblings to some extent.
Take a quick look, help for a moment, bring the bottle, etc. In this way, they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are integrated.
As long as they are still able to be children themselves, I don't see a problem. If your K1 is able to entertain themselves for a short time and it's okay for them, that's good.
You can best judge for yourself whether it's suitable for your children. It's not as if he should be wrapped up in K2 and accompanied for hours while falling asleep.
Legally, it is probably questionable. Perhaps this is also the statement of the psychologist.
For if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you want to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book! I read a crime/thriller a few years ago and I can remember almost the entire plot, but I can't seem to remember the title. Maybe someone here can help me out...
The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and entering his enclosure with his predator cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, is drawn to the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with fear. The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There are more suicides and there is a new protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned before every suicide to go to the site and document it, and to post the photos online. At least, it ultimately turns out that this therapist runs a kind of underground therapy group where patients are implanted with a chip that suppresses a fear center in the brain, and the patients ultimately subject themselves to their fear in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death.) This confrontation with fear will be referred to as "the fight" in the book.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with fire. This is the rough plot, I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If this action is known to someone or someone even reveals the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the password for the Wi-Fi available. I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take time. What steps should I take afterwards?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Child, 4 years old, Splinter under the thumbnail of the child, four years old, extends over the entire length of the wooden splinter (outer side).
We have tried to pull it out with tweezers. It is very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and it hurt. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
No more chances. Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, making it possible to install it in almost any H0 and 0 gauge locomotives.
The LokSound 5 Decoder is offered with all common interfaces and always comes with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker with a speaker capsule kit. Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder.
He controls the data format DCC just as much as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 speed levels are as self-evident as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically report to a suitable digital central station. It supports all DCC programming modes, and with compatible central stations, the CV values on the main track can be read out.
For those who can only program the CVs of 1-255, there are auxiliary registers. Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels with 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central units. The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections just as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Also, braking with DCC decoder-controlled brake shoes or with constant voltage is possible. In addition, it also works with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC swing motion automaton allows for automatic swinging between two train stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on analog direct and alternating current railways.
After my voucher was not extended due to a complaint that did not arrive at my address, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere, where customer friendliness is prioritized and I don't have to jump through hoops to achieve nothing at all!

Due to Omikron: Johnson will push for booster vaccinations New cases of Omikron are causing politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccine offer by New Year's Eve. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to accelerate COVID-19 booster vaccinations in light of rapidly increasing Om
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow countrymen. So far, the target date had been the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing an emergency situation with the Omikron variant, so the vaccine protection must be strengthened urgently, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine. "Get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137. Compared to the previous day, this represents an increase of a substantial 65%. dpa
Is the full amount refunded from the purchase price upon collection?
I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent in an application.
Today, I received an invitation for a conversation via email. I will respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complex name. I have googled it and depending on their cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now. Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes either. Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them are good.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Obviously, the chair had an invisible defect at the time of sale. How can such a damage to the upholstery occur after 9 months otherwise?
First try it on the #PRS\_ORG#. But that has been working for about
14 days no longer. Therefore, I have always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I have bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were none left.
Now they are available again, and I would like to ask you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content Warning: I will be writing somewhat detailed information about domestic violence here.
I must simply write about something from my soul. I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence frequently due to professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them. I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I am unable to do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach them all. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear, which sometimes brings me very close to tears, is that everyone is worthy of living a life free of violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to simply accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. It will never be easier that way.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, it is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What does the series have to do with "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an awe-inspiring production: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently been released on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Giants Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim; at least the youngster Johannes Patrick let them down.
Again nothing: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back at the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our belly."
After the game, however, it did not calm down - but increased again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereby more than the bare result, the manner of the appearance was disappointing.
A substitute statistic expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was a mere 13 percent, with 4 successful shots (all by young John Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions? John Patrick provided the answer: "After our win in Tenerife, we simply weren't focused enough and didn't implement what we had trained for."
Specifically, to move the ball. His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted quite differently: "It's awesome to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It felt like before 10,000 people." There were only 750 visitors allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, but they came at their own expense.
Not only because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. "The best player I have ever trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team even the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed to deliver. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete disaster and managed to close the gap to eight points, after they had already trailed by 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points. Fortunately, there is not much time for complaining.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM) the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I have changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself a few months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again for this reason. We originally registered half a year ago.
Always peeled like an egg: Max Raabe turns 59 and manages to enchant his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good Day, dear Luck" - if he is allowed to perform. Actually, Max Raabe had planned to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it won't make a difference. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Other performances planned by the singer during the Advent season must also be canceled for now, as stated on the website of the singer, who is celebrating his 59th birthday today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de). From January, the artists then want to make up for the performances that were postponed in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and with pleasure since his youth. In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlagers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women, this is not a problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair neatly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable from the current German-speaking music scene. With the program "Good Day, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample of the furniture wood in advance? It can be used to complement existing furniture and we could check in advance whether it matches in color.
It still doesn't work, I can only sew the cover but not turn the pages.
Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing The new Federal Minister of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been demanded in a Berlin popular vote.
"With expropriation, no new apartments are created, only the ownership structure changes," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to establish an expert commission to decide how to handle the outcome of the popular vote.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rent law. The coalition agreement provides for a rent price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rent index.
I will be speaking with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible. If the rental market does not loosen up despite this, "we will be discussing further steps with our coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to order something and I realized a few days later that I forgot the last step in the payment process. Unfortunately, the product is now no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again? Or if it will come again at all?
#PRS\_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
Coupon sounds great, then I'll redeem it independently in the new order.
Thank you very much for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut my finger. That is an absolute audacity.
At least 100 people have died due to tornadoes in Kentucky. A devastating storm system has caused numerous tornadoes across the US.
In Kentucky could there be more than 100 dead to mourn. The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night from Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives. The storms left a roughly 320-kilometer-long swath of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
The governor of this place, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything is gone everywhere the tornado passed through. Houses, businesses, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees. It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He is counting alone in the state of Kentucky, with up to a hundred deaths, official numbers rising hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of Vitrine #NAME. That's very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced? Or has it been completely removed from the product line?
Is it possible to order these vitrines in another country?
Until when do you report yourself? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand, but can I now order the ceiling and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had returned an item through the contact form and asked if it had been received or processed, as I had not received any confirmation yet.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans. While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for getting vaccinated.
With this, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination. The transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - in the German model - is also intended to increase the willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched to a company where he complained about. This does not improve his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea. It has been a year.
He has clearly not stuck to his old spot and has been looking for something else. You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, it doesn't matter. He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation. That will then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help with first own Boron campaign greetings!
I am currently leading an adventure for a group of 4 friends over the Greifenpass and would like to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players. We are playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts planned, and now I am writing the opening adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet. The premise is that the heroes have to bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action should develop. A few miles from the village, a group of goblins should ambush the hero and lure them into a trap.
I would like to give the player characters the opportunity to resolve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, intimidating, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with. Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.
If the heroes fail to notice, the goblins ambush them in a ditch and flank them to the left and right, armed with bows, while two with spears stop the wagon. If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes all fall unconscious and are subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf. The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If an defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his henchmen and comes to the hero's aid in battle. The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you feel about Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the encounter too much of a starting point for the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder. EDIT: wow, I didn't expect so many responses, especially not so many great suggestions and tips.
I will certainly take many of your ideas into account and now also have more trust in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again. And put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Therefore, I would still like to return it.
Can you then have the receipts brought, so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS\_ORG#.

We did not make the chair. Suddenly, the crack was there.
I was just sitting there.
Here was the lower part, so to speak, the part with storage space damaged. Will everything then be taken away or only the storage space part?
I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post.
Firstly, the transmission was interrupted mid-way through the F2 race today, in order to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the race had caused the schedule to fall far behind plan, one could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
Apparently, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 enjoys priority, and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the race at the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was rule ignorance among the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you are allowed to change tires under a red flag.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen is allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this to Hamilton. Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known if one comments on Formula 1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first puzzle-solving, which is now allowed or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.
I don't generally like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. However, I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
In addition to this, there are constant foolishness that both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter in particular brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the out lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is sufficient directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Even these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air broadcasters. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overcome the disadvantages.
The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that transmits F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the advertisements. Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
To the here: #PRS\_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered. I have contacted the chat twice and haven't received any response yet.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she will check and send an email, and she has never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole at the front part of the chair).
I am asking for support.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filtration system using air stones.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us. Please see the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the performances in comparison. If the pumps are strong enough, one can operate entire facilities with them.
Owning a large aquarium, pumps with 2 or more outlets are suitable, so that multiple outlets can be connected. The MK series has one, two or four outlets, depending on the model. However, air pumps can also be used to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a curtain of air (available in our shop) or with decor that converts air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell, or something similar to name. The MK series has a special, sound-dampened construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple. The blower pump is connected to an outlet or similar using a 4/6 mm air hose...and you can start right away.
The fan pump should be equal to, or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between. This would prevent water from flowing backward, which would cause the water from the pool to be pumped out...
If the blower pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps of the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we specify a processing time of 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily. If everything goes well on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to bend a little, so that no one is upset, just because it took a little longer this time. It would be so, not everyone has understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry...of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not judge it poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that lies exclusively with the parcel services. Of course, one likes to curse these services, even if we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally. Don't be angry at anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that better times will come again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Can you also order the legs in light color here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and TV host into space The daughter of the first American in space, a TV host, and four other passengers have taken a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly selected astronauts back upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded
She was simply carried away, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan expressed himself enthusiastically.
He would rather like to return to space right away, said the moderator. "New Shepard" flies up to a height of 100 kilometers.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated. The capsule that was separated from the rocket during flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above the Earth, sometimes experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed again.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary between the atmosphere and space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board together with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second launch in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was also present, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of largely promoting the business of space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently shine in one color or play through its entire color palette. When the color change is activated, the light stone remains in a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light lasts all year round outdoors. In a snowy environment, its light is particularly good - only a shorter light duration can be expected when the days become shorter.

"Someone who works or studies in biochemistry. I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject itself quite interesting, and the lab doesn't bother me (I have already completed an inorganic chemistry practical)."
I have of course also already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I definitely wanted to study until I get my doctorate. However, I am currently having doubts, especially the career prospects are quite depressing.
On the one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears about great career opportunities and the profession being highly sought after, while on the other hand, one constantly hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really like to know:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
1. What have you studied/ What kind of training have you received? 2. Would you do it all again?
Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering dropping out of university in 2022 and pursuing an education as a computer scientist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them :)
Extra stress during holidays and weekends. This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it. That's why I'm adding a post about it only now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas vacation, is there a lot of stress in our company. As it seems, there is also a lot of stress before holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Assumption of Mary, which we call "Ascension" in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a semi-official bridge day.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend at home. What happened last week?
Stress everywhere. Endless emails that had to be sent out before departure, orders here and there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because? Because "next week then" after so much time doesn't sound right and shouldn't be?
Or because people seriously want to achieve as much in a shortened week as in a normal one? Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also feeling pretty exhausted.
What is this self-imprisonment due to holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent. My question is simply: Are we, the Swiss, the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way? Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her home state of Thuringia - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"The beautiful thing, even if there's no snow in Erfurt, is that you can simply go to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer from Hit Radio FFH. She will join in the fun by baking and decorating cookies with her son.
"I love it", said Catterfeld. But until the contemplative days, she still has a lot to do: "I haven't gotten any gifts yet, I need to start getting things done now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth shedding process and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NEKTON-Bio imparts a smooth and glossy plumage to the bird. The majority of feather damage occurring in bird care are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substances, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of flawless feathers. For a functioning metabolism, the daily diet must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals. The composition of NEKTON-Bio explicitly takes into account the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs and balances it out.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no further vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through drinking water or through soft food.
Thank you, I have found the function, unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are it, I have received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with one part. The middle bar is held by two feet... unfortunately, these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we going to do now? I can't build the bed.
The middle beam is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced. The middle beam does not fit into the intended holder.
I am also receiving new ones. When will they be sent out?
No, no flat ones. According to the assembly instructions, these are the right shape, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
At me, they are not flat. Could I have gotten these fitted?
Hello #NAME#, should I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage Two people were injured in a fire at a residential building in Bavaria.
In addition, a estimated damage in the six-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not suspect arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
But it comes much later And I have to pay shipping costs again
To combat fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccination photo Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly commented on his vaccination status so far. Now, the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has motivated him, Şahin shared. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz company Biontech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving an injection against the coronavirus.
There were false information on social media that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," Sahin wrote on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated to counter these false rumors." So far, I have refused because the communication should not revolve around me.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is struggling with a severe Covid-19 illness and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Shahin further. He did not ask about the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust. Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview with the Deutsche Welle circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as the Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at the time. There is prioritization in Germany for vaccination with the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted a long time ago - and according to his own statements, the CEO of Biontech has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in substation: Ten thousand people without power  In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had disabled a transformer station. In the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, thousands of people had to do without electricity for around 24 hours after a fire caused severe damage to a transformer station.
On Friday evening, a fire caused the lights to go out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally completely resolved late at night.
Firefighters and volunteers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The provider thanked the affected individuals for their patience and the helpers for their efforts. We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts, said the head of the Primary Technology department, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will still take several days, as the Westnetz technicians had to temporarily restore some cables, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire, according to the company's statements. Electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out around 7:15 pm on Friday has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to reports from Westnetz. Extensive cleaning and repair work will be required there.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 23:15 hours, even those who were previously affected by the outage have had electricity. Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies have been deployed.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It's important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially older or single people, and inform the local fire stations when help is needed," said District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, according to authorities, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who need power-dependent medical equipment or are dependent on medical care.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros? It's the #PRS\_ORG# daily cover in blue-green.
I hope you also have a beautiful day and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the undercarriage on the tabletop. It is a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations. We wanted the one with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I can't stack them and thus shorten them. Can you help me with that?
Otherwise, I would have to return it, as it is not suitable for the purpose. I would appreciate a response.
Yes, that's really easier! Then we'll do it that way!
Can you send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS\_ORG#. Should I do that now?
I find such a low discount almost shameless. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Combiner Riiber wins  The German Nordic combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted onto the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to surrender again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping into the trail.
Return of order number #NUMBER# When will the money be credited back to my account?
Yes, we have both updated to version 4.5... it could be that they have already heard of problems with it.
I directly bought a book from my #PRS\_ORG#, and it seems to be the right one. But as soon as I want to open it, I get the message, "ups!"
This document cannot be opened. The file may be defective, please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is an epub file from #PRS\_ORG#. Can you help me?
The chat connection is gone and now? I also have to work in between!
To ensure that the paint application is even and clean, you should clean the components with a little soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clean water, and dry. Before bringing the brush into contact with the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later invisible inside of the components or on a yogurt cup. The first stroke on the component
Pull the brush evenly stroke by stroke. Light overlap of the color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistically looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence. Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could otherwise shine through later. Metal tones and metallic colors come with a separate brush at the very end.
Otherwise, unattractive metal flakes may occur when they mix with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve their true appearance through decals or stickers. From national emblems on airplanes to ship names and decorative stripes on car models: the decals give the model the finishing touch.
Arrange the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible. It is easier to apply decals to an aircraft cockpit before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpicks are patience, time, and a steady hand when applying decals. Cut out each required decal individually and arrange them as needed.
Decals are also called water sliding pictures because you moisten the back of them briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark. Then you slide the picture a little bit away from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you gently pull the carrier paper sideways away. Attention: Always check first if the image is sitting correctly before completely pulling it off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book when I look for something else, then I can no longer read it and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and find my place up to where I have read. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you once.
Will I receive this by email? Also for all 3 packages?
For the lamp arrived in 3 separate packages at my place.
Ok, thank you anyway! I will buy it elsewhere as soon as the money is back.
Do I get the problem back, though?
Fertilization treatment for private health insurance / What is an "insurance event"? Hello everyone,  In the context of private health insurance, a "Versicherungsfall" or "insurance event" refers to a specific situation or occurrence that triggers coverage or compensation under the terms of the insurance policy. This can include medical treatments, hospitalizations, accidents, or other health-related incidents that are covered by the policy.  When it comes to fertility treatments, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), the definition of an "insurance event" may vary depending on the specific policy and insurance provider. Some policies may cover certain fertility treatments, while others may not. It is important to carefully review the terms and conditions of your private health insurance policy to understand what is covered and what is not.  If you are considering fertility treatments and have private health insurance, it is advisable to consult with your insurance provider to determine what, if any, coverage is available for your specific situation.
We were in fertility treatment for some time, and now, when it comes to settling with the private health insurance, they are suddenly being uncooperative. In the following order:
We had applied for fertility treatment through our statutory health insurance (PKV) in advance and received approval for three attempts. The attempts were in no way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was accounted for under the PKV. Some time later, we tried to have a second child and conducted 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not yet account for them under the PKV.
We again applied for cost coverage with the private health insurance (PKV) and were granted three more attempts. After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed, logically, we bill the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a nasty surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With the pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise fall. The second desire for a child is a new insurance event.
According to the terms and conditions, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment and ends when the need for treatment no longer exists." Here are the questions for the experts in the round:
Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (we have 5 attempts to reimburse)?  Should the PKV have informed us in the terms and conditions that with a birth, the further attempts would expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here. Thank you already for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants per email and let me know how I can best reach them again?
Alright. We won't be ordering from them anymore.
If you add the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), it is obvious that they have lost a good customer. They are welcome to forward this to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was triggered and now you're telling me that I have to send it back first. I can't do much about the fact that the commode is completely disturbed when it arrives with me.
Please see in the screenshot what my colleague has written. It is clear and explicit that the repayment was triggered and I have still not received any repayment via #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have now lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment using his account.
We will not be doing that anymore. No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they may not sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products being advertised with additional horns that we unfortunately cannot find with you?
Can you help?
Theme of the week: The best low-budget films  What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say: >A **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the internet one can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know interesting representatives of this category?
What appeals to you? And what might you not like at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I wanted to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now also reliable? Thank you very much.
There is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position... I'll give up again soon because it just doesn't work here. Hello.
"Half victory" against Belarus comes at high costs for the EU, according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
The costs would be very high and would result in massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the border between Belarus and Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd). The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, said the researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not exactly small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while. Bossong ruled that the treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is an "increasing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stance against this, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time. "It seems to be unable to assert itself when a member state insists on doing things its own way", as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow the EU border protection agency Frontex access to its border.
In addition, the EU is paying a price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong. The agreement on the asylum policy is being made more difficult because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at border crossing.
According to reports from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to cross the border from Belarus into Polish territory. A spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday that 55 migrants were apprehended and returned to the border overnight.
Polish officials were attacked near the town of Czeremsza by migrants who threw stones at them. According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in the past months or attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania reportedly closed border sections. The EU sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners are traveling to the countries of origin of the people to prevent their departure. The most effective element of the EU's reaction would be the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough measures and extraterritorial sanctions. Minsk must also take into account the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society is probably not geared towards the fact that the security apparatus regularly pushes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale, claiming that Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest. The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to an alleged violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase, when he is said to have overtaken irregularly. A second objection was lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in accordance with the rules. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the last lap of the Mercedes and won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, during which the Dutchman overtook the car in front of him.
I am checking that. I am speaking with the bank and will report back to you.
Thank you for the support
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting the SC Freiburg Fantag. The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announces, members and holders of permanent cards of the Sport-Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day. In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters shone in red and white through the jerseys on that day. Foxy, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been cooperation between the Bundesligist and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it has shown how well the partnership fits.
"Shining fans can be seen enjoying the roller coaster together, which confirms what Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack says."
Why is it €#NUMBER# and not originally 1699€?

I'm sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true. That's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
Neither of you will admit it, but Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply leave it completely alone. Yes, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Who seriously questions the evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost. As far as I'm concerned, a God may have initiated the whole thing.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense. And with that, you are an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain the optimal field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically aplanatic-achromatic designed lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and color errors up to the edge zone.
Often, magnifying glasses are marked with magnification specifications. However, these specifications only apply to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To use your loupe optimally, we kindly ask you to follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (see user manual in the packaging). Light reflections can occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses.
By applying an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. With proper use - the lens close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Fir tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees. Farmer Frank Diers has already experienced many curious situations during his fir tree sales.
Once, a man even drove home alone without his partner because they couldn't agree. He plants around 2000 pieces every year for this.
During this time, the 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations. This makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit amusing, he says.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, I'm out as a customer!
At least I received a defective delivery and now have to pay the full price for it. I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both of them have their name. In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which certainly doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with fiber optic + Devolo DLan/Magic We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble building a stable WiFi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly and received and sent 50 Mbit with only a few exceptions.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and at the DLan module connected to the FritzBox, these are also available. However, at the other DLan module, which emits the WiFi, no longer the full 500, but the more I move away from the module with the device in the house, the less I get (i.e. use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower in the first floor than before (~45 Mbit). I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DSL, but there were also similar losses. Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost with fiber optic cable through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables throughout the house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I have created an account here especially. Therefore, I would be all the more grateful for a response.
When it's time to change the current account, those who thought there would be a break in current accounts are disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to have their customers confirm the fee increases of the past once again with various tricks, the free balances for negative interest rates are also declining further. For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros for a long time.
Now she has halved and even quartered the allowance. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request. And not only for new contracts, but also for "newly agreed individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already lowered the limit to 50,000 euros before, which still applies, as does the case with ING Germany. The popular among cost-conscious customers direct bank DKB has lowered the allowances in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have already set a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers there, in which the consumer centers even won in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutes should possibly make provisions - in case the higher instances declare the negative interest rates to be fundamentally illegal and millions of euros have to be refunded to bank customers.
The tabletop for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston leads a whole beauty army and is now officially at the forefront of Hollywood.
But their life is like a journey up and down a mountain. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a stir in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
At least, that's what Aniston says, she allows herself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag). That her hearts of both male and female fans still equally fly is actually a miracle.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck - and is still looking for the great love. And has crossed off the baby wish from the list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. This hurt her.
The people who asked don't have a clue about what's going on with me medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also make one happy.
Undeserving end of a career: Räikkönen has to retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 ended up being quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the tire, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix after less than half the race distance. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, marking the end of his career in motorsport's top tier.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte triumphs in the two-man bob - Sport The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 victories is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
I have calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season, then I could make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who recorded two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg. First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and on Sunday he drove 0.30 seconds ahead with a larger lead. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he beat the Briton Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also secured his 22nd win in a row.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was traveling to Stuttgart, came in fifth this time after previously coming in second. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too," said Lochner. Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka.
At the women's event, Laura Nolte secured her third season win in the two-woman bob on her home track. After only managing fourth place in the monobob the day before, she stormed to victory in the German triple success with her brakeman Deborah Levi in the bobsleigh World Cup on Sunday.
Two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thuringia came in second with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. She not only qualified for the Olympics but also achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig. For me, it was super cool, first podium finish in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama is with me.
I am super happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the starting times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a little annoyed about the not entirely error-free rides, but said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now! What should I do?
I did not receive it and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time for it.
And now it was said that it had expired, which really annoyed me. Look in the chat, it was about the Asare armchair.
I would like to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping only starting on March 16th? Nothing was indicated on your website about such a long delivery time.
No, only when I type it in does an extra field appear with the message.
Yesterday it was taken by your colleague. Why is it a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one, not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear wonderful girls and women.
I have something I simply want to write about and maybe it will be of interest to someone... I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is basically my child 1-on-1.
My friend (since 6J together) is sick, he has burned himself 2nd degree on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn). He is also feverish, and we are currently seeing each other less frequently (1-2 times a week), which is causing me a lot of trouble with my needs for affection and love.
My dog is currently suffering from stomach ache, I have cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was there with the warm lamp and stroking him. I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is currently away for a month.
Now we also have homework assigned to us, which we naturally divide among ourselves. But cooking is especially a lot of work for me...
My PTBS illness is currently quite well under control, I am relatively well-treated and managing alright. Not great, but I'm getting by and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (personally), tomorrow at 3:00 PM I have a written test for which I haven't done anything yet, and on Tuesday of next week I have an anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a little. And the following week I have a oral exam on Tuesday, which is in my calendar but not in my head because there is no more space left.
My week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then everything continues, right?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend. Only until...
And so it goes on eternally. I believe I am simply so stressed that I need these mental guidelines, otherwise I won't be able to cope.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way... Does it also happen to you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work. Really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
Don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise. I think it also has something to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a refreshing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color and surface is scratched and there are marks on the table. In the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!! What can you offer me?
When we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The email for the cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#, otherwise twice.
It was confirmed, but not ratified.
Something completely different: I discovered back in school that many religion teachers don't believe in God and it's just another subject for them like math or geography. For me, that was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed.
How do you feel about it? Perhaps you can also tell about colleagues from work and/or studies with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate them. There is also a curriculum etc.
But wouldn't it also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity? What would motivate someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserving culture or something like that? I hope your question is not too private.
Can't it be changed or not? Please write in English, I understand it well. This has been going on for a long time, so I would refrain from it.
That's good, thank you. I expect a response shortly, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hello dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24 years old). I believe it was a movie for young people.
In the film, there are two time axes (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a plot ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm so that he can live. I believe the transition is also the grave of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If that means anything to you, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept on her stomach since week 1. Fast forward: still alive :)
Relax. Such a child can hold out much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, occasionally go in and take a look, but no continuous monitoring. That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress.
No pillows. Ah, and we always had a blanket instead of a sleeping bag.
Observe your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Can something be raised from the stomach? Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
You can deduce from this that everything is in order. We are all grown up, and when my husband was born, it was the custom to put the children to sleep on their stomachs.
Furthermore, we are already your "regular customer" and have bought many articles from you. But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It is about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet. Please contact me as soon as possible.
The wardrobe is currently not usable.
To put it bluntly, RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV as well.
It's just that the politics of this broadcaster are now completely discredited. Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then they go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a continuous billboard."
What are we now? An 0815 advertising broadcaster trying to bring its BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, they apply to everyone, except for Simon and Etienne.
They are of course allowed to continue insulting people. A Krogmann who lacks any empathy and is trying to make ash out of the rented rooms that exploded at the expense of the action.
How should one find all of this good? Great if it pleases you, I find it terrifying.
I am requesting a recall, as the wooden table that was delivered to me is defective. The body is broken due to a damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comforter for stomach ache or simply for cuddling – my little heat friend is versatile. Cherry pit pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing heat applications, as cherry pits can absorb heat very well and release it again as needed.
The removable inner cushion can be easily heated in the microwave or oven. The soft fabric makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel well.
The cherry pit pillow with cover is exclusively intended as a heat application for the following areas of application: Before warming up the pillow, check for unusual odors, stains, or burn marks, and dispose of it immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the packaging before warming it up! Warm up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the manufacturer's instructions for the microwave!).
Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly throughout the pillow by shaking it. Then place the inner pillow back in the cover.
During the initial heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated applications. Please strictly adhere to the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (risk of ignition and combustion!).
Please check before warming the pacifier in the microwave that heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions. After the warmed inner cushion has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pacifier on suitability for babies (max. 43°C) at your elbow!
Do not use the pillow with acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory complaints, fresh bruises, bleeding and open wounds, as well as in persons with reduced pain sensitivity. Please consult a doctor before use if you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, or if you are pregnant.
If any seams have opened and loose beads have come out, dispose of the product and the loose beads immediately and inaccessibly to children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the temperature of the baby should be regularly monitored during application to rule out overheating!
All serious incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authorities in the country where the user is based. The product is removable and can be washed at 30°C in a machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt to Hinserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the football Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone. For Ingolstadt, things are not going well under their third coach either.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski, and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working. I thought the power supply alone would be enough for operation.
Incorrect display, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the power adapter inserted. Therefore, I removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Perhaps you have some ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is there anything else broken? Thank you for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# brought to my room. How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat is.....
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
The 20-liter capacity is also sufficient for larger photo equipment, which can be securely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers. And everything else you need in everyday life remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to the practical access to the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series is also presented in a new look. The chic, minimalist design has it in a nutshell - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment.
This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid, which can be secured with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already proven itself with messenger bags. In the locking mechanism, there is a metal locking hook with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are 4 anchor bars, securely welded, into which the locking hook can be hooked. If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take out the top bar, and if it's rather empty, you take out a deeper one.
Flap closure and hooks are also magnetic. This way, the backpack can be reliably closed without the hook getting stuck.
The second feature distinguishes the Everyday Backpack fundamentally from other photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
Simultaneously, this clever detail greatly enhances the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you not only take your photo equipment but also everyday items or travel gear with you. In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily separate and store both - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to, for example, access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while the everyday things remain safely in the left backpack compartment and don't get in the way. Comfortable, easily adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And because the outer layer of the backpack is made completely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it rains in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# sent me an email yesterday for confirmation of the commission.
Contact from the shipping company regarding the collection of the incorrectly delivered table has been announced. So far, I have not received any messages.
I am requesting immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support staff member, with none of whom I have gotten further than the promise that I will receive an email as confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It can be seen when the wardrobe could be delivered again? Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on January 12, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the coupon, I will place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture piece and did not return it. And that last year turned out differently than expected, I could not have foreseen it and could not have redeemed and clarified it in a timely manner.
But the damage as a customer, I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver who values reliability and safety in braking, even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake discs are manufactured using casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All tuned discs are produced in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain discs and patterns. Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that focuses on the selection of the disc according to the properties of the original installation.
The brake discs manufactured in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency. Additionally created openings increase the cooling efficiency of the disc, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
Aesthetic properties of our tuned discs emphasize the character of every car by an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the town where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glittering rocks in the water at the southern junction of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked out, tents were pitched, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the land.
For many, it was said: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bust)! In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will be searching for gold, recruiting workers, rounding up horses, and building businesses. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding riverbeds and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers have the same idea! You must surpass your pioneer colleagues to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory. You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works more and more for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your board allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage. With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your own individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California gained statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then, their choice is revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a block! This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes. Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and thus changes the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, i.e. has hidden each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where players must defend Coloma from an attack by angry bandits. If the players have contributed enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery. The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I use the shipping method "Warensendung (Spiele einfoliert)" for items up to a size of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
For everything else, DPD is usually insured and comes with package tracking (tracking number is provided, packaging is wrapped in bubble wrap and packaging paper). If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a box within a box for an additional cost of 2 euros, which ensures that it arrives at 100% of no printing marks.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away. Dr. Michael Winterhoff, a well-known child psychiatrist, is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education. Former patients and legal guardians are now levelling serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is difficult to endure. And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
To parents and other responsible parties, it must never, never, never! be about gaining power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is sensible and possible in the situation.
Brrr, I'm still shaking.
Holetschek: Countries are advising on the abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals. The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing requirement for triple vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We need quick clarity from the countries, whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Health Ministers' Conference, to "Bild am Sonntag". The lifting of the 2G plus rule for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to make a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the following Tuesday. - afp
I also want to return the lamp. What is the best way to proceed?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me?
I am unable to process any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#. Error message: Oops, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# website on the computer is going. I have updated my account details.
Why is this happening?
What you describe is referred to as *awareness* under general anesthesia. This occurs with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
Most often, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain. Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as deep anesthesia is avoided to protect the child until weaning.
Previous episodes of awareness during anesthesia should be mentioned during the discussion of anesthesia. Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear all, my comment accurately describes awareness, however, u/Nitemarex did not have any by definition. I misread their comment.**
The chair is, however, defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help either.
These are legal warranty claims. The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is besides the legal obligation also a standard in the field of eCommerce. Please check again if you at least take back the defective chair.
We will then sell the second chair privately, which means we will also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email which you did not reply to. Again, the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I must cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Shall I not be called? I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on Friday.
There is still the new book on the table, fresh from the press: "An Old Man Growing Older". The shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has kept until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I already want to testify my gratitude for life here."
There are different types of pallets. One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.

Rollo Tips & Tricks I had received many great tips here last week for the perfect goulash.
There was something for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery! So thank you again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and I want to cook Rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve. Tomorrow I will make a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What happened to the books and how can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English may not be as good as it used to be, but I'll manage.
This text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been processed.
But until today, the money has not yet been received by me. Would you please check that?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the space of Lübeck, for many people goose or duck belong to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
You haven't bought any poultry yet? Time is running out.
We will reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas roast in the Lübeck area.
The "drive" of a tube amplifier stage significantly contributes to the heat and fat content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN-, and MASTER VOLUME-controller, you can on the one hand set the desired volume and on the other hand set the distortion content of your sounds. In addition, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-controller, with which you can reduce the sound level without having to adjust the "Gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that with the POWER LEVEL regulator, you can even create a performance reserve when it gets unreasonably loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal attached here is processed with a box simulation, so you can get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using a headphone or direct recording.
To the AUX input, a CD or MP3 player can be connected, so you can jam along to your favorite songs. There is also a tuner function on board, so you don't need a separate tuner.
Who wants to additionally treat themselves to a VFS5 foot controller, can also comfortably call up the sounds with their feet, switch the effect blocks on and off, and tap the tempo of the compatible effects. For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But I have seen this with others. Is it then possible for you to send the lamp back?
Because it's too low for over a dining table? So I would like to return it.
Can you help me further?
And what about the commode? Will we receive another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it's not possible, I would be satisfied with a legacy or voucher as well. Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods that I don't need, spending over 1,000 euros is a bit too much.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
That is not a satisfactory answer, and the wait time was not worth it. Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreement  According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in negotiations on reviving the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are about to agree on the agenda items to be discussed, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna. This is a "positive and important development" because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. On Thursday, the Vienna talks to revive the agreement were resumed after a brief interruption of almost a week.
At the negotiations, negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating. There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state now has highest coronavirus incidence Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had the coronavirus incidence above the mark of 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had consistently shown the highest incidence rate nationwide, the value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased but was still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported in one day.
200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated with intensive medical care on Sunday in hospitals. There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
Furthermore, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is scheduled for the beginning of March, it may be possible by then.
I must print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right? Do I not need to click or enter anything else?
I want to avoid exactly that, which is why I am writing to you. I would like to kindly request that you allow me to cover the cost of the return shipping.
An 8-euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, an outrage.
It's time for changes  Greetings, German Bundestag, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall at the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
Why is the post here? If one looks at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, one can conclude: it is not existent.
We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for a few months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what was the problem? For the most part, this is likely due to dissatisfaction with how certain things have gone and how we generally stand.
In the last few days, there has been a growing impression that many people here still have a strong desire for the German Bundestag. #What we need to change
At this point, the community around the MBundestag is being asked which ones they want to keep alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days has become aware of this project and has found, to put it simply, a pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have found the desire to rebuild the project. However, I would like to explicitly call on everyone to participate again, only in this way can this project have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server through this link.
Goals: * How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
What existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed? How should we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How should new members be recruited? * How do we create a fair election system?
I am quite sure that I have forgotten some things, but that's not too bad, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the time and inclination, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that is still to be delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different hanging from you.
I put it together and then noticed it when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I get a full refund. This is also quite sad as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I still have a question: does the daily pillow #PRS\_ORG# come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
#PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective cabinet will be picked up promptly. I kindly request that this be arranged now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the cabinet as much as possible for pickup. They must clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how this can work. #PRS\_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pickup appointment.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time do I have to obtain it or decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan? Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like.
You yourself have lived vegetarian for a while, currently you also rarely eat meat. I myself was a vegetarian for several years before that.
To the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And that I thought for a long time that I would support animal welfare as a vegetarian, but eventually reflected and understood that I ultimately support animal cruelty by doing so.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that resentment arose on their side, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, animal suffering was reduced.
Now I ask myself if my answer was too simplistic? How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without one intending it. Greetings from a vegan who loves harmony (;
This does not constitute an exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am on the assigned date, on which #PRS\_ORG# does not pick up my return in person. Since I cannot be present in person due to a funeral, unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup date. Starting from 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be available again continuously.
Lahnsteiner Dam for water rescue equipped: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state  Recently, the Rheinland-Pfalz interior minister, Roger Lewentz, handed over a subsidy of 45,000 euros in the Lahnsteiner town hall for the new water rescue equipment of the volunteer fire department Lahnstein to mayor Peter Labonte.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in safety.
I am glad that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this matter," says Lahnstein's mayor, Peter Labonte. The device will be used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, they are permanently prepared for increasing deployments: the boom in hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a recreational river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book.
I have followed her recommendations, but synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app has not worked. I am a bit frustrated because the whole process has taken me a lot of time and I am now hoping for help.
Alright, then that's what I'll do. I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS\_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking an interest in this whole matter. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, that is, we were also armed executives. I don't want to go into this any further! I find the question of right and left to be very oversimplified.
Generally, one should say that state servants tend to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone. It should also be clear to everyone that people in uniform and armed with weapons may be attracted to the right of conservatism, and that these people may have difficulty dealing with the lived reality. It is also clear that besides the average white person, there are now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and homosexuals (and by this I don't mean the overly feminine stereotype of gay men, because there are fewer of these in the executive branch), and to these people I can and must rely, because in doubt, they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience represent a conservative stance, i.e. they are proud of Germany and feel less at ease with overly left-wing politics, even if this politics seems to be for them or thinks it has to do something for them, they simply want to be treated normally. Back to the right, of course, the police and the military are also a cross-section of society, where one will also find extreme right-wingers, but they are allowed to openly express their opinion there or even openly hatch state-threatening plans, which is completely exaggerated in the media and also annoys me.
Of course, it happens that even policemen and soldiers, who were often deployed abroad, begin to generalize due to negative experiences and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. It also happens that right-wing sympathizers meet from time to time who engage in lively intellectual exchange.
Nevertheless, this is effectively combated in my opinion and also countered with political education and enlightenment! Germany is so heavily entangled internationally, and in my opinion, that's good because we couldn't afford to have genuine racists and Nazis in our ranks.
Yes, what I don't understand, I have also ordered the other basket on the German side. Why should this come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out. I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It is still about my order, which is no longer deliverable. I had previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany or is this basket available in Germany somewhere else? I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the top edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow, and there is a small scratch on the mirror itself.
Is it normal for a child? Hello, I (w32) have been busy with something for a longer period of time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, with very little free time), but I have always struggled to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis. There are always phases where everything is left lying around, and occasionally I get the urge to clean and tidy up.
But it's actually never like "someone could just drop by for a visit spontaneously". My husband (unfortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere but usually the household just loses out to work and lack of motivation.
The kitchen is cleaned most regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We haven't gotten one yet, but we're working on it and this question has been occupying me for a while. Because for me, it doesn't provide any motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as long as no visitors come and things like fresh clothing are available and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child provide a greater motivation or do you remain sloppy? I look forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers maximum comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-shaping with special, deeper engraving at the joints for improved mobility (in arm and knee bending).
For the Focea Comfort 4, the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase comfort. Seamless stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaped areas in the lower back and thighs provide a close-fitting, perfect seat. The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and securing equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body. Seamless, thin (-2mm) insulation on the face at the hood increases comfort, insulation, and durability (separate hood).
The soft, collar-located zone improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment using a flexible, gentle hook-and-loop fastener that does not adhere to the coating or stitching. Double-cuffs with zippers at the arm and ankle joints connect a removable inner cuff with a soft, coated neoprene outer cuff.
45° Curl at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and durability when pulling on. Long zipper at the nape with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P Back-rip zipper (Overall without hood) with metal slider and integrated Water Dam System for improved sealing (Beuchat patent) zippers on arms and legs.
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the ripping fasteners to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels are bonded with outer and inner overlapping.
Beveled edges on the outer cuffs for greater durability Rounded edges on the inner cuffs for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to secure the computer in its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder? I have completed an education in software development and have been on leave for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am becoming more and more aware that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now. The problem: I have a self-doubting (avoidant) personality disorder (AVPS).
This means roughly that I have no self-esteem and am therefore shy. I have no problem talking to people on a factual level, but it is very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe I have improved in this regard).
Can I become a social worker like that? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete work routine is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find anything about it on the internet. The ÄVPS is already causing problems (for me, emotionally) in my job, because it brings me down every time there's something wrong with my code ("I've messed up the simplest things again") and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should already know how to do this"/"I'm holding them back with my dumb questions"/"they must think I'm really underprivileged" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at this point.
But you have already returned the sofa, right? Because there was no confirmation for that.
I am waiting for a pickup appointment. What do you mean by "return"?
When I download a book from #PRS\_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS\_ORG# authorizes this book, but there are problems" appears.
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken with the feed (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds up its own protein substances from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high strain on the animal's overall organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disturbances in the breeding process. After the short-term use of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement) should be resumed.

1 gram of NEKTON-Bio should be added to 250 ml of water or 100 grams of soft food. It is recommended to only prepare as much water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
A marked measuring spoon (enclosed) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In cases of severe feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given at the beginning, until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is fully completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sun exposure, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That's really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and I attached pictures. Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community member contradicting the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman
I have the following problem. A walnut tree on our property needs to be felled.
A felling application has also been submitted to the community. An employee has informed me that felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
In the bylaws, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree. Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I can rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
I thank you for your answers
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message, well, I still have a sofa that's unused.
Could you offer me a discount or a voucher? What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that's possible. The question is, can I pay in euros and have the cover shipped to Germany? Can you check on that?
Urgent message: Serious traffic accident on the St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg has occurred recently.

Ah okay, I understand. Alright, then thank you very much again that it was so easy!
Advice and ideas for further professional life Merry Christmas to you!
My Christmas is unfortunately only moderately good, because my dear head is currently dismantling everything that can be dismantled. Before I now dig up... briefly: I need advice, and best from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a career changer. Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I do not mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me. At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that it was the right choice, even though the framework conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job postings" and it has only been half a year.
Before I start painting, I always decide to continue and at least finish the undercoat. After that, I can still change my mind. But right now, I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now there are vacations, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but my weekend was also my weekend and my leisure time was my leisure time. Then I had free time.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now even the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me. Overall, it's fun and from an external perspective, the Ref runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I'm wondering how much stress my body can handle before it completely shuts down - if it's not doing that already. I'm wondering if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions here - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work a bit boring, I was appropriately paid and worked together as a team, not as a lone fighter like it's most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back at the same place in a year's time feeling dissatisfied as I do now. You know, everything is somehow confusing, but perhaps as outsiders you have ideas or suggestions on how I can get out of this situation, which I am completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions at the moment, as I am currently quite emotional, which is likely to lead to nothing good. But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me. I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, among other things, through the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and Amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers maintain an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is based partly on real analog circuits, because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances seem to bubble up.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and distort historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which again led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. The new VT+ Valvetronix series, ranging from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for here.
All guitarists dream of the warmth and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage is what primarily determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit with a 12AX7 tube in every VT+ amplifier embodies the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers. The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it wasn't enough for a win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost on Saturday 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placed and foldable hook-and-loop fasteners, it adapts entirely to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for every type of camera - from mirrorless cameras of all sizes to full-frame DSLR cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash. Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fujifilm X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store all kinds of accessories. And if you have a small mirrorless camera (Olympus MFT cameras, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and photography-related items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: longest in history In just under three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still unnamed volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists dare not make any predictions about when it might end. The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV station RTVE. Damages in the millions.
In the barely three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This is equivalent to almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land masses were formed by cooled lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares. The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island, was particularly affected, from which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly live, and which was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and further areas were heavily affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts Christmas is at the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something tempting about them. Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a peace-promoting "social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition. How Nicholas became the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated the Christmas holidays closely with gift-giving. Prior to that, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in some way.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw gold into the windows of three women in one night to save them from a life of sin. From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German tradition of filling children's shoes with gifts originated.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the idea of intermediaries between God and humans as "saint worship". For this reason, they distance themselves from the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition. The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such detail questions so strictly, it only irritates a few that the custom of St. Nicholas is similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period. Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree and at the door in boots.
The diversity of traditions in Christian countries provides evidence of a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who now brings gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who is essentially a kind of Nicholas, has been assigned some characteristics over time. These include, for example, his white beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the chimney to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas. In Spain, it is the Three Wise Men who give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the Christ Child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought some fame. Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the handover of gifts.

Police shoot dead suspected bank robber near King's Palace In the vicinity of Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot dead by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had alerted them to a man who was said to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon. According to authorities, the man fled in a vehicle, which was later stopped by officers.
There were shots fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not operate on the basis of a terrorist background. In the vicinity of the Kensington Palace, there are several embassies located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I will be redirected to your page immediately.
The decorative lamp harmoniously fits into any bed, garden area, or stone garden. The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery. Maximum brightness of 10 hours.
* The robust plastic execution is applicable all year round in the outdoor area. In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that glow colorfully from the inside.
"Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in a total of six different color tones). The rounded, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the rock garden. He also does well in neighborhoods with larger pebbles and boulders, where he manages to assert himself due to his size.
You can save big on preliminary work: "Smart Stone" does not require wiring or batteries as a solar light. Simply place the "Light Stone" on any sunlit spot during the day.
Two supplied stakes provide a firm grip when needed. The matte white plastic cover itself is robust and weather-resistant.
His solar module discreetly hides "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light. The battery charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
As twilight sets in, "Smart Stone" starts to light up autonomously; in which color, you decide: You have a choice of six attractive light colors, in addition to daylight white. It eventually shuts off automatically when the battery charge reaches a predetermined minimum or when it gets lighter outside.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts from the beginning the next day.
I have already done that several times, but it doesn't work.
Regrettably, I would have liked to place another order with you, but if the discount is not credited to me, I will not place any more orders out of principle. If you decide otherwise, please let me know.
Otherwise, then today would be the last contact. Then please send me the number for the sideboard.
In the lockdown, hardware stores were closed anyway...
The motor control of the LokSound 5 has been fundamentally improved again. A variable, adjustable PWM frequency from 10kHz to 50kHz ensures a particularly quiet operation, especially with bell armature motors - the typical "buzzing" belongs to the past.
The load regulation can now be adapted to difficult cases with up to 10 CVs. The unique "Autotune" function allows for automatic tuning of the decoder to the motor.
The LokSound 5 Decoder provides up to 1.5A of motor current, enough power for older motors. Please use the Ebay shopping cart so that the shipping costs are calculated correctly.

Pill problem  Hello dear female population,
I hope I'm doing everything right, this is actually my first post after a year on Reddit. To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pains and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) before my period.
I would like to keep this as it is now, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had an approximately two-year break and suddenly, explosively, I got acne from 0 to 100 and it was everywhere. So far so superficial, but it bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel well.
In the two years of the break, everything has never really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this happening again.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and silicone-free, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me. Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, the dear skin is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis before puberty, then a period of rest, then widespread knotty skin and acne. I have also tried everything in terms of nutrition during my Christian illness and ended up sticking to a sugar, milk, and meat-free mixed diet because nothing else worked so well.
It can also be good that the worm is simply hormonally present, but when one, as I do, wants to avoid searching everywhere, one would rather not look for what else might be going wrong.
I had already written everything to her colleague (seminar, etc.) and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered regarding my matter.
I always have to work and answer the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What should I check if the money was there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
but he is generally available in large quantities since he is available in black in large sizes

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments in everyday clothing on the judge's bench in the courtroom.
But much depends on their judgment, even if they don't wear robes: jurors, together with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone goes to prison. Two of them report in a conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of a total of 125 lay judges at the District Court on John-F.-Kennedy-Street.
Hello, unfortunately I am unable to access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have the means to store it for so long.
We would use the table as offered by them as if it were ours.
Sure, I'd be happy to help. Here's the translation:  "Gerne, I had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful now, I would like to order one in gray."
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
110 kV underground cable to be built new in 2022. The permission for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The decision on the planning approval by the government of Lower Bavaria clears the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk now.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the transformer substation Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected near the Edermanning village near Reut to a mast of the overhead line.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially at our place so far.
The blue Betssell number: #PRS\_ORG# with the order number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the process will continue? A beautiful start to the week!
You can forget that, I have already explained it several times yesterday! This is a glass commode, and all the sides are burst, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is damaged.
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS\_ORG# regulations. This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Subject: Lesson Planning (EK) Hello dear colleagues,  I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you today to discuss the topic of lesson planning. As you know, effective lesson planning is crucial for the success of our students. It helps us to ensure that our lessons are well-structured, engaging, and meet the needs of our students.  I would like to share with you some tips and strategies for effective lesson planning. Firstly, it is important to have a clear understanding of the learning objectives for each lesson. This will help us to focus on the key concepts and skills that we want our students to learn.  Secondly, it is important to consider the needs and abilities of our students when planning our lessons. This includes taking into account their prior knowledge, interests, and learning styles. By doing so, we can create lessons that are tailored to the needs of our students and that will help them to achieve their full potential.  Thirdly, it is important to include a variety of teaching methods and activities in our lessons. This will help to keep our students engaged and motivated, and will also help to c
I have been teaching at the Ref since the summer, and teaching is fun for me. However, I currently have major problems with time-efficiently planning my geography lessons. Unfortunately, my school is not technically well-equipped, so I basically only have the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media to use.
At school, I can also only copy s/w for free (which is annoying for geography). I currently need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself. In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I always start with the learning goal in mind (what do I want to achieve) when planning and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We have the book Terra and I am rather dissatisfied with most of the exercises in the book.
Therefore also the exercise sheets. Maybe a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really enjoy it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. I have actually already decided to go for a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
The trade fears the 2G regulation for the Christmas business. In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or have recovered may enter.
The trade considers this to be unnecessary and laments revenue declines. It also has a possible solution at the ready.
The 2G regulations are ruining the important Christmas business for the retail sector, according to the German Retail Association (HDE). Umsatzeinbrüche (decline in sales) are to be regretted, criticized HDE's CEO, Stefan Genth, for businesses with articles of non-daily needs.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1,100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies look negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many have already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth. Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis sales in the past week.
It's going well only in the food retail trade and in the online sector. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO. "2G shopping doesn't advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a lot of personnel effort. He demanded that the bandage regulation be nationally approved.
After that, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would be granted access to all businesses with the received voucher on that day. Additionally, random checks should be sufficient in retail, as they already are in public transport for the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested).
Even the real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop, which specializes in shopping centers, spoke of difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were recently at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent.
These numbers will now fall securely in the middle of such an important Christmas business, said CEO Wilhelm Wellner of "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a hotel club, can enter all stores unimpeded." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and there is also a defect on the frame, which was attempted to be concealed with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly. I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged it and sealed it back up.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high power and high color reproduction. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Utilize the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp produces a very high luminous flux with soft light of high quality, completely free of flicker. The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large surfaces at relatively short distances, is excellent.
By the way, also in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances. You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
At the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot for NP-F batteries (not included in the delivery) User memory The memory has up to three settings for brightness and color temperature.
To execute the settings for individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time. The memory controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality, as it is possible to operate it with cost-effective NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before use whether the batteries have enough power - it has a built-in battery tester. For each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display windows (the left battery in the upper display, the right on the lower display). In addition, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the flashlight with current via the included power supply.
The construction of the flashlight is very simple. You have a 16mm threaded sleeve for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably set using sensors on both sides. Attention was paid to the fact that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy use.
Additionally, a knee joint is included in the scope of delivery. It's great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Shame, I got it as a gift and it's too small 🙁
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a spectacular comeback against Leverkusen.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row without a win in Hesse seemed to be on their way to the next league defeat. But then the SGE turned it around, got rid of the frustration of a mediocre start to the season within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have done today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and praised each individual involved with a "general compliment."
It initially looked like another setback for Frankfurt, who were still trailing behind expectations in ninth place. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2-0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach. "How the players then came back and put on a fantastic performance," said Glasner further.
I am insanely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result. Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game day and overcoming his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I think our mentality is incredible", said the 27-year-old with a glance at the result, especially for the viewers. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he is also well-prepared in terms of the personnel situation. It is extraordinary that we have all the players fit in December, that all the players are physically in top condition.
It is top-notch work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle. Now, we want to "take things step by step and remain humble" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up, on Wednesday as part of the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30, Sky) scheduled.
I received the email that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# and have it redirected, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is cancelled? Unfortunately, that would mean that I won't be able to order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Mufflers for the women's handball team before the quarterfinals against Spain  Germany's women's handball team is sneaking off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the main round of the World Cup, the German national team suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face host Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too nervous and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we need to act differently. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished Group III of the main round with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danes (10:0).
It's a shame that we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game that we all played, and we have to delete it," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, there must be a clear improvement against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup on the coming Tuesday, to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007. The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was midfielder Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," midfielder Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We have to look forward quickly now." Not up to par from front to back.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the top of their game from the start. Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after just seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades. The first goal for the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this, however. Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly make an appearance - and when they did, they mostly failed due to the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Scandinavian team's goal.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since midfielder Mia Zschocke was sent off early due to a hard foul on her opponent. However, she is allowed to participate in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the German national team start to play better and at least come within five goals of the lead by halftime. The already faint hope of a comeback after the break was gone after just seven minutes when the score was 9:19.
Once again, the Greens' protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who counts among the medal contenders at the final, to win. As a result, the German team was unable to recover and went down as a clear loser on the court.
ROOF-Advent calendar Day 6: Family traditions during the Christmas season As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have secured the St. Nicholas Day and use this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions during the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas Day, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it back then at your place? How was it with your\*r partner\*in?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is most beautiful for the children?
Boot cleaning? Cookie baking?
Decorating trees? Playing music?
Does Santa Claus come, the Christ Child or is the gift from Grandma and Grandpa? It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone makes an effort to have a beautiful family celebration around Christmas.
Whether these are now established traditions, or even something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help with the confirmation of the transfer... etc.
I would like to redeem a discount code, as with #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers.
Does that work for you?
The title already exists, I am working as a vaccination doctor in mobile vaccination teams, in which (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these will soon be largely completed, it will then go on to some extent to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without any time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided that they are not personal in nature (e.g. "I am taking medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination?"). Within my area of responsibility, this includes providing information about the vaccination, determining eligibility for vaccination (a person has a right to vaccination according to the Corona vaccination ordinance and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and in case of allergic reactions, emergency care (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical staff. However, in vaccination teams, we often don't have anyone there, but rather (thankfully, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for preparing the vaccine, who cannot (are not allowed to?) perform vaccinations, so I also have to carry out most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution. What is a "Huidlerer"?
This dialect speech, sent in by someone from Amberg, has caused heated thinking in the BR television program "We in Bavaria". But unlike on many previous days, the term "Host mi?" remained unmentioned by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And also not one "for whom everything must go quickly".
What the people heard from the TV moderator was completely wrong. The man from Amberg provided the solution and thus probably also caused surprise for many people in the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidlerer", the audience learned, "is a cloth with which someone wipes the oven". Dialect researcher Anthony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typically Upper Palatine term, somehow derived from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern". Thus, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for two weeks now. After the confirmation, I always get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# device, connected it to the computer, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing helped.
Tire choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of motivation to prepare for my upcoming bike tour, at least a little training.
Said, done, and I rode off on my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were really nice - but then what lurks in every city (this time: thank you, Krefeld!) happened.
Glass shards on the track. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the track in any way.
Since I couldn't get a replacement tire and tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around half-heartedly and take the first train back home. It wasn't technically all that bad, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change again before the bike ride.
Now I am faced with a question and I hope you can help me. Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would extremely dislike to encounter this problem repeatedly.
Now it wasn't really bad, since the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man, who on the day I picked up the bike had ridden 120km by 12pm) and who had already referred to them as suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years. But when I think that I still have to change the tire after 80-90km of riding, then I think I'm really in a bad mood :D
Now I have struck up a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be indestructible. Of course, it all sounds very tempting now.
But are they really indestructible? I have little desire to now spend 40€/tire, only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I am asking myself: I believe I currently have 25x622 on my racing bike. There are also (apparently?) wider options available in the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you recommend a different type of tire for a racing bike in general?
The Swallow page seems to be more suitable for my absolute beginner! Would you rather recommend the Durano DD? Thank you in advance for your help and best regards!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured  The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten when his car collided with a traffic island for unknown reasons and then veered onto the opposite lane, according to police.
There was a head-on collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old. As a result, the 53-year-old's car was thrown against a tree, trapping the man inside.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old passenger were seriously injured in the accident and were taken to nearby hospitals.

Hello everyone,  Finally, we can announce that we will be organizing the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to well-known reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement. BUT: At least three people will be present per shift, so we will be streaming the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow us!
We do our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we'll do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30. Start cooling your drinks, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
