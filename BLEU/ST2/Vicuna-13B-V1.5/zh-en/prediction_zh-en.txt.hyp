Is there a way to punish him to prevent such an incident from happening again?
Can you help me ask whether the restaurant will be ready soon?
Please arrange for a reply as soon as possible, thank you.

This is a very meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate. It is one of the important skill certificates, besides the driver's license, that I hold.
Please disseminate the following information: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken in the event of a sudden accident, i.e., pre-hospital emergency treatment before the arrival of the ambulance. As we all know, it takes some time for the ambulance to arrive after an accident occurs, and it is precisely during this time that the situation is most critical.
This is the time when emergency care is needed. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or stop breathing, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is so important to have someone nearby who knows first aid! When someone nearby collapses, we can use professional knowledge to rescue them instead of standing there helplessly, doing nothing. This feeling of helplessness is too frightening.
In China, we have official data of three hundred thousand people dying from accidents every year, and the most dangerous one is heart attack. In the United States, on average, 15% can be saved.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 78% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%. This was the first reaction of the founder Lu Le.
If someone has a heart attack and stops breathing, with no heartbeat, performing CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) and chest compressions is the only way to potentially save their life.
I have found that few people currently have the awareness to learn first aid, but when an emergency arises, it will be too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly when faced with sudden situations. It may even save someone's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I wanted to achieve before turning 25, and adding the first aid certification to my goal list was a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certifications that I'm interested in. I'm planning to take a scuba diving certification. I saw on Xiaohongshu that there's also a scuba diving first aid certification. It seems like you need to have a first aid certification to take the scuba diving certification, so actually, the first aid certification is quite useful!
I ordered #NUMBER# where a 13-yuan shrimp dumpling is just one!?

Because I saw that the code was valid when I input it before.

Chongqing to Pilot "Modern Apprentice System" in Vocational Schools - Xinhua News Agency  According to information obtained by a reporter from the Chongqing Municipal Education Commission, starting from this year, Chongqing will pilot the "Modern Apprentice System" talent cultivation mode in 60 vocational schools. Students who receive pilot training will have the status of apprentices and will be pre-registered as unit employees of the pilot enterprises upon enrollment.
The municipal education committee requires that the recruitment and employment procedures for vocational schools be standardized, clarifying the dual identity of students as both vocational school students and potential employees of enterprises. According to the principle of mutual selection, a tripartite agreement should be signed by the students, schools, and enterprises. For students who have not reached the age of 18 but are over 16, a four-party agreement must be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific job position, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the student's on-the-job training. The pilot schools are encouraged to adopt modern student-centered forms and collaborate with enterprises to conduct pre-job and transfer training for employees.
The pilot school aims to reform the talent cultivation mode. The school and enterprises jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, position standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Take the cultivation of the curriculum as a pilot period, the internship time of students in enterprises is determined according to the talent cultivation plan, and the peak internship generally lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, the enterprise-based management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different professions, one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students master the skills required for each rotational post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 municipal-level intermediate vocational student modern apprenticeship pilot sites in three batches, with about 50 people in each pilot site, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) to be trained. According to the principle of piloting first and then promoting, the pilot sites are gradually expanded to the whole city. We explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated talent cultivation between schools and enterprises, in order to effectively improve students' job skills, increase their employment rate and improve their employment quality.

South African doctor: Although the transmission power of Omicron is strong, most cases are mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although its transmission speed is faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the South African province of Gauteng has reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. Dr. Unben Pillay, the head of the organization, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them have required hospitalization.
Pei Li said, "They can control the disease at home and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to fall seriously ill from COVID-19.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta variant, the patients he treated for COVID-19 had "breathing difficulties and low blood oxygen levels. Many of them needed to be hospitalized within a few days."
Two weeks after the first report of the omicron variant of COVID-19 in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although it will take a few weeks to collect enough data, the observations and early evidence provided by the doctors offer some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, among the COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in recent weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe cases in the previous wave. The average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, while the death rate among early cases in South Africa reached 20%. The director of the African Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, citing data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, said, "Currently, almost all the signs indicate that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "Currently, we are still in the early stage, and we need to obtain data from the later stage. Generally, hospitalizations and deaths occur later, and we have only been in this wave of the pandemic for two weeks."
Meanwhile, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while also testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods. Although Delta is still the main strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, Omnicron cases are now appearing in over 30 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, increased by 400% in the first week of December. Tests showed that over 90% of the cases were of the Omicron variant.

Yang Huaidong announced the spirit of the 6th plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress by drawing inspiration from the century-long struggle of the party.
On December 10th, the Hunan Daily reported (by a journalist from all media outlets, Gong Beiwei) according to the unified arrangement of the Provincial Committee, on the morning of December 10th, the Provincial Committee Standing Committee member and Provincial Committee Propaganda Department Director Yang Haodong visited Ma Lan Mountain Video Cultural Park for an interactive lecture, to deeply study and implement the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, to study and implement the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping for Hunan, and to study and implement the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress. Yang Haodong explained the core principles and practical requirements of the conference from three aspects: ideal beliefs and initial missions, self-revolution and youth party, and party leadership and party theory, combining his own insights and experiences, explaining the essence and requirements of the conference in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the whole conference and the important speech and important instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the important speech in Hunan, and to learn and integrate the spirit of the provincial party congress. It is necessary to strengthen the awareness of defending "two establishments" and fulfilling "two maintenances" in thought, politics, and action, and to move forward steadfastly along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping. During the interactive exchange session, representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprises, and youth discussed the relationship between the three historical resolutions, the decisive significance of "two establishments," how cultural enterprises should grasp direction, and how new-era youth can draw strength from the 100-year history of the party. Yang Hao East answered with simple language and vivid examples, and he encouraged young party members to draw progressive power from the 100-year history of the party's struggle, to closely unite around the central party, and to unswervingly follow the party, using youth to fulfill responsibilities and take on responsibilities.

Because the delivery time displayed is faster by 30 minutes than the actual delivery time, thank you.
Yes, he has already changed drivers and has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has been saying "processing" for several hours.
I have taken the photo and uploaded it to you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why it keeps delaying the delivery time.
It turns out that I didn't call for #NUMBER# after all.
If I don't eat, I will definitely complain.
You can't send it, why didn't you tell me earlier? You've been making me wait for so long.
No, I haven't received the call. Please notify him to send it to our company again.
I don't want to wait any longer for #NUMBER# minutes.
A meal has been waiting for one and a half hours, but it has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order, why can't I cancel it?
Hello, the live chicken delivered by the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it. So, I want to find a relatively affordable practice racket first. However, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to the friendliness. If you can't distinguish between the two, it's normal for the more expensive racket to be more friendly, and such "entry-level rackets" are actually industrial waste.
They are very weak. When the ball hits the racket, it vibrates a lot, and the hard ball can't withstand it. Even professionals find it difficult to control it. The logic and hidden agenda behind their existence is - tennis is so difficult, you can't learn it, and you won't buy expensive ones, so we'll sell you cheap ones that are easy to break, and you'll stop playing after two tries. That way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel bad about it.
When you can really tell the difference between good and bad, it means you have made progress. Come back to me then to buy my expensive ones, and I'll make twice the money. I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a slightly used racket, choose Prince or Dunlop, these two brands are not popular enough, so the good rackets won't sell for a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 is fine, and a used one for 200 is a great deal, isn't it enjoyable to have the experience of using a racket worth a thousand yuan for only 200 yuan?
The text can be translated to English as follows:  "It's quite friendly to newcomers, but once you pass the newcomer stage, it's tough. However, most people, especially women, can't get past the newcomer stage."
May I ask for your help in following up on the order as the delivery time has been repeatedly delayed?
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a translation for this text as it is not clear what it means or what language it is written in. Could you please provide more context or clarify the language?
That is to say, I already have credit, right?
Next, do I need to place another order? Can I ignore the previous one?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but there were many things missing in the food that was delivered, and the chicken was also raw.

In the next three years, Jiangxi will train 10,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for rural primary schools - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Nanchang May 22nd (Reporter Chen Yuxuan) According to a report from the Jiangxi Provincial Education Department, in order to strengthen the shortage of teachers in these subjects and achieve balanced development of compulsory education in rural areas, starting from 2016, Jiangxi Province has planned to train 1,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for each rural primary school in the province over a period of three years, with a total of 10,000 teachers.
According to understanding, the training objects are primary school teachers in rural areas of Jiangxi Province who are 45 years old or younger and have a foundation or talent in music, art, and physical education. They can serve as teachers for other subjects in addition to music, art, and physical education. Through training, they can master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music, art, and physical education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, grasp modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus cultural ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of music, art, and physical education teachers who are proficient in multiple subjects to alleviate the problem of shortage of music, art, and physical education teachers in rural areas.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi plans to provide training for 100 counties (cities, districts) in primary school music, art, and physical education, with a total of 300 trainees. The training aims to comprehensively enhance their demonstration and leadership abilities in teaching, research activity design and organization, instructional skills, and the ability to build online research workshops. This will play a role in teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes, we can't wait for another 20 minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.
I have found the buyer of the wrong order, but my tire is missing.
Hello, when will the ordered food be delivered?
Your delivery rider's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and his name is #NAME#.
May I ask for a reasonable explanation, but your driver has some issues. Please handle it well.
Can you please check if it's still on the way? If it can be delivered, that would be the best OK. If it's really not available, then return the money for the order.
Actually, there are many requirements for clothing matching for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls who are overweight, the length of the skirt should not be too short or too long, and it should be around the knee, just covering the fat on the thighs.
A skirt that is too short will expose the fat on the legs, while one that is too long will give the impression of being short and fat.
If you separate the top, middle, and bottom into three sections when wearing clothes, it will seem like you have naturally grown taller. Using different colors for the top, skirt, and long socks can create a slimming effect. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are the signature of chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. The noble and elegant black short skirt is also the first choice of chubby girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially black shorts, can make you appear slimmer. If you have chubby legs, avoid wearing socks and shoes that draw too much attention.
The more popular you become, the better. Don't make your color too vivid, lest people get the impression that you have fat legs and feet when they pay attention to them.
For slightly chubby girls, it's important to share tips on how to dress well. Chubby girls should not wear tight mini skirts, and tops should not be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which can make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, black tights or grid tights (the kind with finer grids) should be worn. Choose a soft and printed flared skirt and pair it with a blouse with a ruffled collar. This can cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls quite well.
Of course, when a chubby girl wears a short skirt, she should also be particular about it. Fat girls wearing short skirts should choose tops that match the color of the skirt, which can effectively enhance the height of the chubby figure.
Wearing a mini skirt with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the hottest summer style! If you are an MM with a fuller upper body but slim legs, I recommend choosing a short dress with a glamorous feel.
This text can be translated into English as follows:  Not only can it cover your belly skin, but it can also showcase your advantages. An A-line skirt looks slimming and is more suitable for girls who are on the heavier side. When choosing a top, it's best to go for something form-fitting to create a layered look that accentuates your slimness.
Simple white T-shirt paired with a short skirt, even plus-size girls can try. Girls with a bit of extra weight can also exude fashion sense.
As long as you can master the rules of clothing matching, even the chubby girls will become the focus of everyone's attention. After changing in clothing matching, it's also important to exercise more in life and strive to break free from the label of chubby girls as soon as possible 😄

Heat dissipation effect: good Lightweight: convenient Appearance material: satisfactory Hongmi has always had a high cost-performance ratio. The new machine is very good.
The performance is stable, with four exhaust vents for heat dissipation without any issues. It's worth recommending this ASUS ROG Strix Gaming laptop as it's quite good in terms of build quality and materials, and the brand is reliable.
In terms of the price of the HP Pavilion Gaming Dragon, it is still not considered expensive. Personally, I think the HP Pavilion Gaming Dragon is really good. The gaming effects are comfortable, and it can play most games smoothly. My chicken eating game has a stable high frame rate, and it is very smooth. LOL and CSGO are not a problem at all, and most 3A games can be played smoothly.
Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is quite good, the fan is quite powerful, the work is quite quiet, and the game effect is quite good. The appearance material: The appearance is quite cool, the game itself is a wind display effect. Display effect: The screen is quite clear, playing games at 1080p is enough.
Buying a laptop feels really great, it's mainly used for design work and has a high cost-performance ratio. It's lighter than I imagined and looks better too. The red on my butt is a beautiful color of wine, not too flashy, and the overall quality exceeds my expectations by a lot. It's a good buy and suitable for girls too. Two years ago, I started using HP laptops, and after using it for two years, the cost-performance ratio is still high, but the quality is too hard!
I also recommend all my friends around me to buy this product! I have already purchased three machines from this series.
The appearance is beautiful and the configuration is also very good for buying for an external relative. I originally planned to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he was in a hurry, so I had to buy it early. As a result, I missed the big bank activity, which is a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics are also quite fast. Let's come back and evaluate it after a while. It's a new, high-performance gaming laptop with a very high cost-performance ratio. The design style is very good. It has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display effect: bought 3D rendering software for the child, the software is installed, the child said it can be used without problem, this computer is suitable for 3D design work. Bought for the son, he said it's good.
The computer is quite good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, even if you don't understand, it's good to ask, and the recommendation to buy is not bad. The game's graphics are really top-notch.
An order of shrimp dumplings only has one? Why does the copy have 6?
I am not going to be the delivery person.
This 1 hour no one has contacted me, this is basically online fraud, you think I'm calling you for the first time to order takeout?
After the investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order, and that's why the order was successful. How many days ago was that?
From 7 pm to now 9:30 am, it has not been delivered yet. It is necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Claiming to be the loudest exhaust in the New District, this time our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4! With a starting price of nearly two million yuan, an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, and four-wheel drive, why is it called the LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? The little editor doesn't know either, according to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0 to 100km/h. That means by the time the little editor's Myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h, huh.
The low car body, the imposing scissor door, the large air intakes scattered around the car body, and the glass-covered 6.5 V12 engine that leaves nothing to be desired, perfectly interpret the style of Lamborghini. As for the description of the car model, there is no need to say too much, you can Google it yourself, and the editor has prepared some explanations that may not be given by Google!
Too much attention is being paid, where everyone is looking, I feel very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's a bit exciting) 1km of fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all).
Practice getting on and off the car, otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing (because you won't be able to get out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud, and you will be deafened when you get off the car (but it's still very exciting).
The car is too big to fit in a regular parking spot, and I'm afraid of getting scratched by the wall when the neighbor's car door opens. It's a bit lonely on the road because there's no competition (I'm talking about myself, not the car owner, haha).
Please don't misunderstand, the hypercar in this video is not for sale, sorry! If you want to shoot a video for your car, please feel free to contact us!
More car information that you don't know is in The Car Guide / People's Automotive Encyclopedia, involving a car accident worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are cars that most car enthusiasts are familiar with. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of a Porsche 911 is also in the six-figure range! Recently, in just a few minutes, a Porsche 911 worth hundreds of thousands of dollars and a Bugatti Chiron worth millions were involved in an accident abroad!
Based on the results, you are right!
I ordered a package and two things were delivered incorrectly.
The order wants to pay the service fee to the courier.

To promote the improvement of entrepreneurship and innovation abilities among college students, the Guangxi Education and Human Resources departments have collaborated to establish entrepreneurship platforms, build more off-campus practical teaching bases, university science parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases, to provide external support for college student entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases for undergraduate schools should exceed 30,000 square meters, and for vocational schools, it should exceed 20,000 square meters.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship courses, and prioritizes supporting outstanding students in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to transfer to related majors. University teachers must go to industrial enterprises for on-the-job training for at least two months every two years to improve their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Education Bureau of the Autonomous Region requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the university student innovation and entrepreneurship training program, striving to ensure that every student participates in a innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their time in school. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.

The full-vision wedding photography base (Hebei store) does not currently have any branch wedding fashion avant-garde makeup artists, and the photography techniques and angles are also top-notch. The photography results are very good.
The seller has a very good reputation and the service attitude is also very good. The makeup is very exquisite and the team service is also very good. This trip is very happy and the team is very professional. The seller's service attitude is very good and I will introduce it to my friends. I am very satisfied.
Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist for giving me a unique wedding dress photo. Thank you to all the staff who helped take the wedding dress photos today, I look forward to seeing the finished product.
Taking wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for the photographer who runs and jumps around. The makeup artist was very thoughtful and designed a makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer had a humorous and lively shooting style, and it was worth praising.
Thank you, my photographer and makeup artist, for making me look so beautiful that I can see it in my lifetime. Praise the bride, her eyes are beautiful, her appearance is generous and well-proportioned, at a glance she is a virtuous wife and mother, and in the future she will be frugal and take care of her family.

The wedding dress photos are so beautiful, blowing up the photographer and makeup artist, you are really super super professional. Thank you sister Mu for your patience to accompany and meticulous guidance, I like the photos taken a lot~
Seeing the wedding photo, I suddenly didn't recognize myself. As long as the photographer is good, you can also have wedding photos that can rival those of celebrities.
The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and makeup artist are both aesthetic. Fortunately, I met them. After seeing my wedding photos, I found out that I was also a "trickster".
More than 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, accusing three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - of discriminating against Asian American applicants during the admissions process. The complaint was filed by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission requirements of top American universities has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in the three top American universities has basically remained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and continuously discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the so-called "holistic review" admissions process. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the admission rate of Asian-Americans was the lowest among all ethnic groups when compared to the number of applicants.
Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions.
They also hope that universities that have been complained against will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asians. So far, the three universities that have been complained against have not responded.
The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint with Harvard University alleging discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education declined to accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to American Chinese organizations, the groups participating in the appeal include American Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani, and other ethnic education organizations.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory located in Yushan Town, Yongjia County, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated with the owner's family member, Lin, on the details of purchasing the factory and transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank as a deposit on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the buyer on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Agreement" which stated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week." However, due to disagreements on key contract terms such as the scope of the sale and payment methods, the property sale contract was not signed.
Considering that both parties failed to reach an agreement on the contract content, a few days later, Mr. Lin returned the deposit of 200,000 yuan to Mr. Lu. The house that was carefully selected, the deposit was paid, and the down payment was also ready, just waiting to sign the contract, but the seller did not sell, which made Mr. Lu helpless and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin at the Yongjia City People's Court. After the trial, the court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it was not appropriate to blame only the defendant. It should be reasonably inferred that the negotiation failed, and therefore, the case should not apply the penalty of double the deposit for breach of contract. The defendant does not need to bear the liability of double the return of the deposit for breach of contract.
After the first instance judgment, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the second instance court upheld the original judgment.
[Lawyer's Reminder] It is necessary to exercise caution in the transaction process. As the buyer, you should fulfill your duty of care when signing the contract, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is currently occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties during the performance of the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he might send the wrong address.

Taste praise, meat is good, service is enthusiastic, it's been a long time since I came to Dayu. The fruit picking is still so delicious & authentic, and the ingredients are abundant. The first time I tried the pork belly bun, it was my favorite soft and floury southern flavor!
The porridge is cooked to the right degree, with a generous portion size. The signature stainless steel chicken wings are as delicious as ever, and the soup is also quite good. The flavor of the oregano is handled well... Overall, the taste is great, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
The text reads:  "Ri Chang Lao Diàn - Many years ago, it was also a web celebrity, located in the East Single Building, with wooden floors. You had to wait a long time to eat the braised rice dishes at the entrance, and the pot in which the braised rice was cooked had cracked..."
It has been several years since I last ate at Day Chang. The rise of various small restaurants serving Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow. It's rare to see a seat available when you arrive, but the quality of the food is as good as ever, just like before.
Taste praise, meat is good, main dish praise Daychang takeout.
Rice meal: The dish this time was a bit disappointing. Three-cup chicken: The vegetables were a bit too much, and the chicken was a bit too little.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the saltiness is not strong enough, which highlights the sweetness, everyone can add some sweetness and various spices to the dish...
What is the translation of the following text from Chinese to English?  红牌威士忌喝法是什么？每个人的爱好不同，有人喜欢收藏，有人喜欢美食，当然也有人喜欢品酒，红牌威士忌是目前各个国家最畅销的苏格兰威士忌之一，而且红牌威士忌曾获国际洋酒大赛金奖。
Every bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to savor it, won't you be wasting its aroma and flavor? So, how do you drink red label whiskey?
Here's a simple introduction to the red card whiskey drinking method:
The Glenfiddich 15-year-old single malt scotch whisky is made from a blend of about 35 different Scotch whiskies. It has a rich and fragrant aroma with traditional characteristics of Scotch whisky, and a fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. On the palate, it is rich and refreshing with a hint of grassy and smoky flavors.
This liquor can be directly added with ice to drink, or mixed with your favorite beverage to enjoy. Upon the entry of Johnnie Walker whisky into China, to cater to the taste of the locals, the combination of Johnnie Walker whisky + Coca-Cola or Sprite or other bubbly drinks has become a timeless fashion trend.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize the sour taste, can also bring visual pleasure to people and play a role in diluting the alcohol flavor and changing the taste when added to the drink. Red whiskey + slice of lemon + sugar (sugar can also be replaced with sand sugar) is the most authentic and traditional way of drinking.
The authentic red wine has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize the sourness, and lemon can bring a refreshing fragrance to the wine. Of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. The above three are the best ways to drink red wine, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
If you cannot change my store location, can I have it delivered instead?
So I don't need to give you more money, right?
The colleague's order has been delivered, but it can't be completed.
What about GPS? Is it there or not?
Mrs. Jin's wedding photography (Nanjie store) has not yet had branch photography due to our time not being arranged properly. We changed the time twice, and consultant Lanlan was very patient in helping us arrange the time.
Later, I chose a weekend with good weather to shoot. The staff of Jin Furen were all amazing, whether it was the consultant, makeup artist, or photographer.
That was my first time doing makeup formally, wow ~ I can't believe it, I will also become that beautiful one day, haha. Xiao Jie and another sister (sorry, I forget her name) did my makeup super patiently, and the makeup looked very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in the Bay City, fortunately, the weather was very good that day and we didn't feel too cold during the photo shoot. The makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothes, accessories, and immediately help us tidy up if there was anything not quite right. The photographer was also very humorous and we all felt very happy after a day of taking photos.
When choosing photos, because we had seen many cases online, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos. But when we were choosing photos, there was absolutely no intention of adding photos. We just took the 24 photos that came with the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my cousin, who got married around the same time, had a wedding photo package that cost over 7,000 yuan and added over 1,000 yuan worth of photos. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many). The photos are ready today, and Lanlan sent them to me. I looked at them and found two that I didn't think were very good. They immediately helped me re-edit them.
Take out the photos that my sister took before and compare them with ours. I am really satisfied with our photos, they are simple and fresh, which is the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xunhan Jinfuren to take wedding dress photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan Thank you for your sincere wishes, may you be happy and fulfilled. The road ahead is like a brocade!
How much is this set?
What conditions must be met in order to use $32?
That's fine, you don't need to return the money.
Your driver says he can't find the place.
But I don't understand the English he is speaking.
Shall I return the curry base to you?
I only received half of it, there are six boxes that I haven't seen and haven't been sent.
The company is working overtime, and we haven't had lunch yet. We wanted to order takeout, but our order was canceled.
Your name is Zheng Meng, and this is your second week in Japan. You are walking on the street, suddenly you find someone following you. You are scared and start running faster, eventually taking off.
That person behind you called out, "Miss! Wait a minute!" (full Japanese dialogue) You stopped at the entrance of the convenience store. "Miss... I'm a director. You look very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very suspicious and afraid that this is a scam. He gives you a business card, and you discover that he is really a director from a large entertainment company in Japan.
"If you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The fee is definitely not to be missed." You were stuttering and agreed to come to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street at a glance and hoped you could come.
You think about no loss and can still make money, so you signed the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts.
In the early stage, celebrities and ordinary people will live together in real life to cultivate mutual understanding. In the later stage, they will enter the game together to conquer challenges.
Next week will start the official recording, you don't know who your partner will be or what interesting things will happen.
So, how will the system handle the driver for the new order?
I think I cannot accept an order that takes more than 20 minutes to deliver.
Sabah's 3,200 newborns without birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (Kota Kinabalu, 11th) The Sabah National Registration Department said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper being used up, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborns since early October, resulting in a total of 3,200 affected individuals.
However, the director of the agency, Kamaruzaman, assured that the records of all babies who have applied for birth certificates have been recorded in the system, and the anti-counterfeit paper will be replenished as soon as it arrives next week. He made an explanation at a press conference in response to a news report by a media outlet that had reported on the issue of the printing of birth certificates in Sabah for 10 months.
He said that the problem arose two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same issue. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory producing custom anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, resulting in a delay in delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from that used in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from the inventory of other states. Kiru Aminucius revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work.
"The bureau will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to place an order next Thursday, and immediately proceed to the final stage of printing in Sabah. It is estimated that it will take 2 working days (December 20th) to deliver to the applicant's hand. "We will notify the applicant to collect the admission paper at various branch offices."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 admission papers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock in the morning until now, isn't it almost time?
I am referring to food.
I am waiting across from #PRS\_ORG# again.
Okay, thank you, the restaurant says it's ready.
So I placed a new order using accumulated points, thank you.

The appearance is very good. As for the performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a while.
The machine is fast, bigger than imagined, and the rendering effect is mediocre. I like it, and I will evaluate it again after a while. The serial number of the machine searched in Hong Kong should be of good quality.
I don't think it's big, it's heavy. Actually, it's not easy to hold with one hand. It's slightly larger than 15.6 inches, but it runs very stable, and I don't feel any lag. I love the sound of the fan for cooling. It feels good, and it's not like a gaming laptop that constantly spins. It's much cheaper than the official flagship store, and it even comes with a backpack.

In terms of weight, it has a certain sense of quality, after all, heavier things feel better. Heat dissipation effect: I tried it at the beginning, and I will evaluate it later.

The usage is very smooth, I will evaluate it after using it for a while.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: I firmly believe that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during a special period - Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua News Agency, Sarajevo, December 11 (reporter Zhang Jing) The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics during a special period.
Recently, China's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo. During the meeting, Kvesic actively praised the relationship between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina and stated that he had a deep impression of China's excellent organization during his visit to China during the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008. He believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period. Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing participation. Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to use this as an opportunity to expand sports exchanges and cooperation with China.
Ke Ping stated that China and South Korea have a special "Olympic ribbon". The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains, presenting a simple, safe, and splendid event to the world.
We look forward to deepening exchanges and cooperation between the two countries in areas such as winter sports event preparation and athlete training. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue playing a bridging role and, with the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity, to promote the continuous deepening of people-to-people exchanges between the two countries, allowing the people of the two countries to "move forward together" and wishing Bosnia and Herzegovina's athletes good results in Beijing. Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete Awards Ceremony," at which Tiandi served as a special guest and presented awards to Bosnia and Herzegovina's best young athletes.
The promotional video of the Beijing Winter Olympics is looped for playback at the event venue.

The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism has issued a notice requiring strengthened epidemic prevention and control at ports of entry. The notice stipulates that individuals leaving land border ports of entry (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) must present proof of a negative nucleic acid test within 48 hours. Arriving travelers to land border ports of entry must undergo at least one nucleic acid test after their arrival.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of announcing the scope of port cities in each province, district, and municipality to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice proposes that qualified port cities can study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
According to the person in charge of the National Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, for some port cities, cross-border trade is a major economic pillar, with frequent exchanges between the two sides of the border. By implementing a differentiated management policy with two lines of defense instead of one, it is hoped to achieve pre-border control, compress the risk of epidemic spread, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported through ports of entry in cities. The aforementioned notice pointed out that this exposed some problems, such as delayed epidemic monitoring and early warning in some areas, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formalization of regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of the entire cold chain, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise epidemic emergency handling.
The notice requires efforts to be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control mechanism in border cities, strengthening the monitoring and early warning system for epidemics, and implementing border control measures. The notice emphasizes that efforts should be made to fill the gaps in epidemic prevention and control in border cities, without any relaxation, and to do the work of epidemic prevention and control in a scientific and precise manner, to strengthen the external prevention and control line. The notice stresses that the epidemic prevention and control work in border cities should be coordinated with the work of ensuring people's livelihoods, and that hotlines for people's livelihoods should be published and made accessible, with regular investigation of potential risks in areas such as the supply and price of basic necessities of life.
According to the notice, the cities at the ports of entry include those with open land, water, and air ports, as well as the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (prefectures, cities, leagues) where they are located, and the directly administered cities. The specific scope will be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on the need for epidemic prevention and control and announced in a timely manner.

Exposing the truth of the US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhua News Agency (video source: Bilibili)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the Bilibili platform sparked widespread attention. The film tells the story of how the United States launched the Afghan war under the pretext of "counter-terrorism" and forcibly exported American-style democracy through war, resulting in 20 years of poverty, violence, and a culture of killing innocent people, committing various anti-human crimes.
Abusing drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, distorts humanity and forms a killing group. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black sites" to subject "suspects" to various forms of torture and humiliation. One atrocity after another has aroused more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video said, the US "war on terror" is becoming more and more terrifying. The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan, but only brought a country full of wounds and countless killings and destructions.
Let's watch the video together to uncover the truth about the United States using the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to engage in bloody slaughter, and to expose the hypocrisy of American-style democracy!
The food delivery was late, and the food had cooled down. After it cooled down, it became dry and hard, and it was completely impossible to eat, and the soup also spilled out.
Cancel immediately! The things that he #PRS\_ORG# sent over have definitely cooled down, and I haven't taken them yet!
#NAME# said you didn't send anyone to call us.
If you don't refund me, I will report you to the police.
I have used #PRS\_ORG# multiple times before, but today's experience was the worst. I cannot accept it at all.
Sure, but please remind the restaurant and the delivery rider as well.
Avoid happening again in the future.
I want to know the exact delivery time, but it keeps getting delayed.
I don't know when I can cancel the order and get a refund for the deposit.
How do I pay the service fee to the driver?
About an hour ago, it was confirmed that one of the riders refused to wait any longer.
Don't intimidate people at the starting line. When browsing bookstores, one can often sense the popularity of books related to success.
The so-called "success books" of today often praise the "best principle" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" first, and then tell you what you need to do. This skips over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it".
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done with great enthusiasm until they are the best, or they are done quickly without doing anything; either they are 100, or they are 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just wait in place. This "best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it is "completely correct," but 99% of people are intimidated before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a decision to suffer, remake yourself, and undergo a 180-degree great turnaround," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who adhere to the status quo, follow the old ways, and refuse to change, you should shout "you must transform" in their ears, which is undoubtedly self-deception and playing the fool.
Most people will feel timid and hesitant in front of the word "transformation," finding it difficult to make a decision; or they may make a hasty decision to undergo "transformation" with a momentary impulse, but often the good times don't last, and they can't persevere for long, resulting in a lack of sustainability. Mr. Ma Sanzhi's famous monologue "Starting from Tomorrow" best illustrates this "universal human nature" classic in a vivid way.
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the barrier to entry is too high. It often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, leaving the vast majority feeling frustrated and disappointed. Perhaps, the "good enough principle" is a more feasible path for ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core principle of "次好原则" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, even if you can't do 100, doing 1 is still good: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dunes in front of your home is also fine, because that is still better than staying in the same place. Overall, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the lowering of the threshold, it has become possible for ordinary people to persevere, and as long as one perseveres, the chances of success will increase. However, the path to success following the "second-best principle" is slightly longer.
In summary, the "best principle" claims to promote the success of everyone on the surface, but in reality, it can only effectively motivate a few. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
The phone is constantly unanswered, causing delays.
May I ask when you will send it, as it hasn't been sent yet?
How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He is two meals short of delivery, but there is an order that has been completed. I want to ask how to contact the delivery rider.
The first driver just told me that there should be another driver coming.
The naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 710 tons this year, according to the latest monitoring results obtained by journalists from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department. The total reserve of naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake has reached 108.5 thousand tons, which is more than 40 times the amount in 2002 when protection measures were first implemented.
The naked carp in Qinghai Lake is also known as the "Yan fish". It is a valuable fish species unique to Qinghai Lake and plays a crucial role in maintaining the safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain in the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, the naked carp was severely affected by human activities such as large-scale fishing, deteriorating breeding environments, and other factors, leading to a sharp decline in their numbers. By 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake had decreased to only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake, prohibiting any units, groups, and individuals from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, as well as banning the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through measures such as artificial breeding and release and the cleaning of the main river channels of the inflowing rivers into Qinghai Lake and the design of scientific and reasonable "fish passageways," the storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's naked carp resources has continued to increase annually. The deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 billion naked carp have been released into Qinghai Lake through artificial breeding and release, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve is an important ecological barrier and water source recharge area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the expansion of the western desert towards the east. To protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the Qinghai Lake water body, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in the key water areas of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

Taking a foot bath with tingling feet, is it due to electric leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good therapeutic and health-preserving effect on the feet. Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hopes to be of help to friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market. From bathtubs priced at over a hundred yuan to those priced at thousands of yuan, there is a wide range of choices for consumers. According to related data, the sales of health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are booming compared to traditional household appliances. However, bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, which poses certain safety risks.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, right?" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a bathtub for his father's birthday gift, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking in it.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a pen and was surprised to find that the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conductive.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was still quite good, even though the bathtub was returned. However, Mr. Li still felt uneasy because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular bathtub in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety.
However, generally speaking, a bathtub is unlikely to have an electrical problem, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular bathtub.
"Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards. You can easily test it with a pen."

However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed an excellent choice, especially for those who lack self-discipline. Training is even better for them. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to learn on your own, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. Firstly, we should look at the strength of the institution's faculty. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, then there is no meaning to this training institution, of course, some newly-established training institutions may not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before selecting a training institution, it is best to inquire about the institution's graduates. After all, only the institution's graduates know how good or bad the courses taught by the institution are. Hello, in fact, I don't know how to answer your question because you have not introduced your own situation. Learning this thing is closely related to one's personal situation.
For example, factors such as profession, age, and the language you want to learn may be related to the industry you want to study or work in. If you are a student who has not yet graduated, or if you have graduated from a computer major, I personally suggest self-study if time permits. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are many offline and online training institutions that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
But if it's the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources on the internet now, or you can also go to Bilibili for a lot of training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through the introduction to obtain free resources, or you can consult me in detail. In addition, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively by combining videos.
If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of learning money and time cost, I suggest going to a training institution to learn. This way, learning doesn't have to be very tiring, and the teachers explain in detail. If you have any questions, there are people specially assigned to answer them. Moreover, in terms of learning planning or supervision, it is also helpful. In addition, many training institutions now sign employment contracts and have internal referral quotas. After studying, they can recommend you to a company, which can save you a lot of trouble in the job interview stage.
Above are my views, as mentioned earlier, due to not knowing your situation, I only gave a general introduction and did not go into detail. If you have any other questions you would like to consult on, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion at any time.
I said I would be there at 1 point, and I saw it in the app.
What do you mean I haven't finished speaking, what are you doing?
I undertake various tasks such as installation, cleaning, and maintenance of wall-mounted heaters, water purifiers, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stovetops, smoke detectors, lighting fixtures, and glass cleaning. I would like to thank those who have silently given me a thumbs up for my professional sewing and housekeeping services. Life is tough, but we must continue to strive for a better life.
Life won't disappoint those who make every effort. If you like, just follow me. I'm grateful for those who silently gave me likes. Life is like this, others only see the results, while we go through the process alone. When facing life, we have no choice but to be strong and continue. We can look back on the road we've traveled, but we can't go back and retrace our steps.
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes exquisite through dedication. Although we may be doing the dirtiest job, we approach it with the most serious attitude, cleaning every corner of the customer's home until they are satisfied and give us a thumbs up. At that moment, all the hard work is worth it, and the investment will eventually pay off!
My daily work - your requirements, my service.
Heartfelt service, heartfelt cleaning, preserve the beauty. The details you care about, Fenggui Home Services make it "clean" for you, serving with love.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English:  "保万家洁净，树家政囗碑，服务到位，洁净到家。室内外保洁，我的日常工作"  Keep every household clean and tidy, plant the seeds of family governance, provide services on time, and keep things clean at home. Cleaning both indoors and outdoors is my daily work.
The crystal lamp is magnificent, but if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. Similarly, in life, one must put in effort and care to achieve success, and pay attention to the details to create exquisiteness. We take this seriously.
Give me a chance, I guarantee you will be satisfied. Quality speaks for itself because professionalism is worthy of trust, and your recognition is my greatest motivation! In today's various industries, it's not easy to do a good job!
But I always believe that as long as I have a sincere attitude, persevere, and work hard, I will be better than others, at least I will be better than those who just complain and sit around. A day's plan starts in the morning, and all the beauty begins from the morning. I hope you start a new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction. May you maintain a good mood all day long. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed; as we grew older, happiness became a goal to be achieved; and as we matured, we realized that happiness was a state of mind, and when we understood this, we were happy. To be the truest, kindest version of ourselves and follow our hearts, we will have no regrets in life. There is only one path in life, and we must walk our own. The two treasures of life are a healthy body and a good mood, and we should live happily and brightly until old age.
At every stage of life, you will encounter different challenges. Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but your courage to face them positively.
Since it cannot be avoided, it's better to face it head-on. The more you fear, the more difficult it will be to overcome; but if you confront the challenge and rise to meet it, the problem will eventually be resolved.
The curator of the Central Academy of Fine Arts collaborated with the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Culture to hold the first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Riyadh, December 12 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Guan) The first Saudi Arabian Contemporary Art Biennale - Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale was officially opened to the public on the 11th at the Diriyah JAX Art Center in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh, with a total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participating in the exhibition.
This biannual exhibition is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China. The director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, Tian Fei Yu, serves as the artistic director. According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial exhibition is "Touching the Stone to Cross the River", which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, and also reflects the current state of cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters and spans six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Borderline Thinking," "Towards the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "On the Spirit of Art." Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists account for more than 40% of the total number of works, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art. The works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create with recycled materials, such as Xue Huan in the "Behind the Story Series: Qi Shan's Endless Picture" (2014), who reconstructed a classic landscape painting using waste materials.
The chief executive of the Diriyah Biennale Foundation, Bakri, stated that he hopes this year's biennale can establish international dialogue and give global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural industry and creative community, and enhance interaction and communication. Tan Feiyu said, "The goal of the biennale is dual. On the one hand, it aims to let Saudi contemporary art participate in the global dialogue, and on the other hand, it aims to let Saudi audiences immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to understanding, a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biannual exhibition. Artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and contemporary art development.
I ordered from the axe and cleaver restaurant, and they told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver bones.
May I ask for clarification as to why the bones can be called to the restaurant for separate delivery?
However, the system is not very convenient. You have to use another room.

Yunnan: Standardize and Regulate the Management of Public Welfare Posts in Rural Areas-Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bifeng) To continue to do a good job in employment assistance for poverty-stricken populations and consolidate and expand the achievements of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the standardization and regulation of the management of public welfare posts in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed a total of 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the employment of poverty-stricken laborers and other disadvantaged rural groups, which play an important role in helping poverty-stricken people achieve employment income, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various fields. The new regulations were jointly issued by the Yunnan Civil Affairs, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly standardized the object range, financial management, position development, and position management of recruiting personnel for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of position development, the new regulations clearly stipulate that it should be based on the principles of "as needed, position-based, dynamic management, and quota control" as well as "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" and "one person, one post, voluntary publicity, and unified management." The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the departments mainly responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for the subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the departments in charge of rural public welfare positions to purchase commercial accident insurance for the personnel in those positions. It also requires relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.

Although the rightists had a period of time when they were full of vigor and vitality in history, it was not long-lasting. It was because they received a little bit of sunshine, they shone brightly; they drank a little bit of water, they sweated. As soon as they had a little bit of ambition, they looked towards Shu; as soon as they were struck, they fell to the ground. However, when it comes to the truth, the rightists played a positive role in the process of social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to the definition of truth standards, the development of the economy, the improvement of science and technology, and the promotion of institutionalization and human rights protection, the rightists have played a positive role that should not be denied. Three, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I pay attention to what he says and respect him as a person. Because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social problems seriously.
But I oppose his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic political situation where all kinds of political groups are mixed together in the mud. This then provides an opportunity for foreign powers to intervene. To change or improve China, we need patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who engage in political opportunism and try to take advantage of the situation are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left again. The left, in fact, is a group of orphans of history and politics.
If we say that the right has positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some of the right's views and analyze their thoughts when necessary. But the left has lost its way because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away! Recently, I have seen some friends mocking the counter-revolutionaries and criticizing the left, and they are full of energy. I think it's not necessary at all.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists, it's a lost cause. Don't try to prove that we are right, and don't even think about trying to get traitors and leftists to acknowledge it. What's the point?
I tell my friends: When the bandit curses you for five mace, and when the leftist curses you for being a rightist, it just proves that the middle path we are taking is correct! Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget them as they grow older, or pursue their ideals but end up becoming obsessed.
As we move closer to our ideals, we may even become evil dragons in the end. I think "left" and "right" generally refer to restraint and freedom, and due to China's historical and cultural genetics, China as a whole should lean towards the left.
While the right wing in China values freedom, efficiency, and development, the left wing emphasizes regulation, fairness, and safety. Currently, society as a whole tends to prioritize fairness, and with the competition between China and the US, a left-leaning stance is more certain to continue for many years to come.
Although I can't understand it, a like is enough, it doesn't matter what it says, it's all about the aesthetics.
I can't wait any longer, I have to place an order at 19:06, it's been 2 hours already 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange" hot searches. What is normal public opinion?
At random, select three hot topics: February 2nd's "two dragons lifting their heads," Hulu's price increase, and the "goods going up in price" incident. The public opinion spreads and forms a peak, and then the index drops (with a smooth curve) and eventually dissipates. If secondary public opinion is generated, small peaks may reappear. They look different from the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" previously displayed on the website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is abnormal public opinion? By randomly selecting six hot searches from the same event, they present a "lonely peak", "sawtooth", and "cliff" pattern.
The following text has been translated from Chinese to English:  【Peak shape】 refers to artificial heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; 【Sawtooth shape】 refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search rankings; 【Cliff shape】 refers to collective withdrawal, where the hot search topic has fulfilled its "function" and moves on to a new task or battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's popularity is exactly the trough of another event's popularity, with only a few seconds between them. This must be a unified army of water army receiving a new task and launching a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of black PR is evident: dozens of hot searches appear on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popularization, which ones lead the trend, which ones shift attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones stir emotions, and which ones influence decision-making. Black PR accounts are deployed in batches and fine-tuned at different nodes, almost taking into account all the elements of public opinion dissemination and diffusion. Public opinion is a science, casting aside personal positions and emotions, and only from objective data, black PR will be nowhere to hide.

Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi recently reported the first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the new coronavirus. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, the three countries jointly announced the news.
Mauritius reported two cases of Omicron variant infections for the first time on the 10th. According to the Minister of Health, Kailesh Kumar Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th. The other infected individual is a local resident of Mauritius who came into contact with someone who had recently returned from South Africa and tested positive for the virus on November 30th.
After receiving isolation and treatment in a hospital, the two infected individuals' nucleic acid test results have both turned negative. They have now returned to their respective places of residence. The Cyprus Department of Health announced on the 10th that the country has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of COVID-19.
These three people are all students who returned from overseas travel at the beginning of the month. Since they are all asymptomatic, they have not been hospitalized for treatment. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the government has continuously increased its prevention and control efforts.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all passengers aged 12 or above who enter the country by plane will be required to undergo nucleic acid testing at their own expense upon arrival at the airport. The Health Commission also announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in the country with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Khumbize Kunkhunda said on the 9th that the country has detected 3 cases of omicron variant infections for the first time. The country's health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these 3 cases of infection.

The Chinese text translates to:  "The order with the money belly is a phoenix claw."  Note: The phrase "money belly" is a slang term in Chinese that refers to someone who is greedy for money. The phrase "phoenix claw" is a term used to describe something that is of high quality or exceptional.
Sure, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do you want me to keep it in the conversation?
I called your staff and explained to them.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
Da Mei 360 Integrated Home Decoration Address: Wan Cheng Nan Lu 156 Hao Xing Fu Jia Yuan 12 Floor
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I decided to come and see with a budget of 70,000 yuan for basic renovation. However, once I arrived at the store, a series of scams began.
I went to the store for the first time and only showed them my house plan. They did not go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, but they didn't know what brand the materials were. Their second trick is that once you go to the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (and once you pay this money, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to them today, they can give you how much discount. This is a big trap, and I became a living example of being cheated. When I was impulsive, I paid more than a thousand yuan deposit.
He gave me a quote with many problems. The 70,000 yuan did not include water and electricity renovation, nor did it include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, which are the basic costs. In addition, their service charge was higher than that of other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. From the beginning, they didn't explain anything clearly and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for my money back, they appeared to be very experienced, with a dedicated team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it happens, biting to death is the customer's problem, and they are completely blameless. There are all sorts of shifting of responsibility, as well as many details, and it's not worth going into them all; it's all tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend found that the house they renovated was of poor quality, and they charged all sorts of fees in the end.
Father pit, they are just the decorative heads of the original swindlers, now changed to become big and beautiful, as if they have gone bankrupt and changed to something else. So everyone should not choose such pitiful decoration companies.
After this, when everyone is choosing, you can Baidu to see these consultations because decoration is not cheap. If you want to ask the merchant questions, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of merchant reviews. For more details, please see the merchant registration statement. The general public has rated the decoration design channel in Chongqing to provide you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, business hours, etc. If you want to find a decoration company, just go to the general public reviews.
So terrifying, please cancel the order if it takes less than 30 minutes!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if 15 minutes or less could be canceled.
The fried chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it.
I haven't received a response for 3 days... Because your system is unable to recognize my credit card, I am unable to join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly subscription plan! What's even stranger is that I use the same credit card every time I make a payment.
Can you exempt me from the transportation fee for now and collect my monthly fee after your investigation is completed? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's already almost 3 o'clock, isn't it time for me to receive compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to deliver the package, but the courier just left it at the door and then left.
I'm sorry, but I need more context to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide more information about the text you would like me to translate?
Your courier has already taken my order #NUMBER# for delivery, but they are still telling me to wait. The courier received my order at 19:25, but they refuse to leave.
May I translate the text from Chinese to English for you?  "我去买完，是否要其他的外卖怎么办"  Translation:  "After I finish my purchase, how should I handle any other deliveries?"
Where has your driver gone, do you still have to wait?
I am going to send the package, if you don't cancel it, I will report it.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept the behavior of attacking people's character. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eradicate this kind of scoundrel.
If we don't consider political parties and factions, the first thing that needs to be resisted is this uncivilized behavior. From the time you sent me a Facebook friend request and posted mocking posts, to when you tried to publish what you called my hometown and father's name on social media, I have already adopted a non-responsive attitude.
After you left, you became even more persistent in tagging me, not only maintaining the frequency of six meals a day, but also continuing to discuss some ambiguous and derogatory remarks about me with your so-called friends on Facebook, such as comments about my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and other things like whether I have strawberries in bed or not. I...can't take it anymore. Later, I received multiple friend requests from your Facebook account with a photo of you and sexually harassing comments.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After I reported the news, you showed no restraint and became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your identity and status. In our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary. Yes, you can continue to use sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to claim that you are only concerned and caring about me. You can even deny that it's not harassment and continue to publish all attacking statements.
No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and figure don't need your commentary.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate her so much just to become famous. My friend asked me, "Is it okay?"
I said it, but you wouldn't believe me. I think no girl would say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Regardless of whether it's in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even basic morality would choose to use this method to harm any woman. I believe that justice resides in the hearts of people.
I cut some of the comments and left them for everyone to evaluate the post you sent. Shouldn't anyone be able to impersonate you anymore?
I can only say that you are the enemy of civilization and will laugh at heart.
I have reported and attached a picture, but have not received a reply.
What kind of cow, if you don't point it out, it's just a chicken with water in its mouth, fresh meat.

"智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit Opens - Rolling News - Hunan Daily - Voice of China Online Hunan Daily December 10th (Full Media Reporter Zhou Bingxun) On the 9th, the "智汇潇湘" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Changsha.
The standing committee member of the provincial party committee and the director of the Organization Department of the provincial party committee, Wang Cheng, attended the inauguration ceremony and delivered a speech. Wang Cheng pointed out that holding the talent conference is an important measure to implement the central government's talent work conference and the spirit of the 12th provincial party congress, which demonstrates the province's attachment to talent, pursuit of talent, and sincere use of talent.

Here, the home appliances are quite complete, with many brands and well-known ones. During the Double Twelve shopping festival, I went to the "Hansdun" water purifier store to see the water purifiers. The store was having an activity, and the prices were quite advantageous.
There are a total of 11 floors in this place, from the 2nd floor to the 9th floor. Both the 1st and 2nd floors are for parking, and parking is free during the day. There are very few restaurants and shops around, and the taste of the restaurants is average.
This elevator is also speechless, like a big disease, from floor 2 to floor 1, going back and forth, I keep pressing this floor, from the emergency exit to the first floor, it's also speechless, directly leading to a furniture store. The furniture store is closed, and the emergency exit can't be accessed from there! Yet the place still needs to be improved, with many areas still undeveloped.
Address: No.555, High-speed Railway North Road, Shibakou District. The location is convenient with a large parking lot, and parking is free during the day.

The Yangtze River's mainstream has achieved full coverage of water-based green comprehensive service areas - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Wuhan December 11th (Reporter Wang Xian) Chongqing City, Wushan Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area was officially put into operation on the 10th, which is the second water-based green comprehensive service area to officially operate on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River after the Luzhou Water-based Green Comprehensive Service Area in Sichuan Province was officially put into operation on the 8th.
At this point, the waterway green comprehensive service area has covered the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The director of the Transportation Ministry's Yangtze River Navigation Management Bureau, Qiu Jianhua, introduced that previously, provinces such as Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu had established and put into operation 10 waterway green comprehensive service areas in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which have been widely recognized by sailors and played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River shipping.
The full coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the green navigation on the Yangtze River, which significantly improves the reception of ship pollutants and the capability of navigation services. According to introduction, the green comprehensive service area on the water is an important facility to provide all-round production and living services for the vast number of ships and crews, and to help the majority of seafarers solve the "difficulties and worries" problem.
This time, two water-based green comprehensive service areas have been built and put into operation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They integrate life services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the highlight. They realize the "one-stop docking, multiple services" for ships in the port, which will make the sailors who have been navigating on the Yangtze River for many years work more efficiently and live more conveniently.
