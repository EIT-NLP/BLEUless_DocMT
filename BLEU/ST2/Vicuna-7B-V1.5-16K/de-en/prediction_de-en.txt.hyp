The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee corresponds to 40% of the item's value.
I am #PRS\_ORG# large customer and therefore it is no problem for me. I just need a number or instruction on how to package the item so that it can be tracked as a return by you.
I have ordered the #PRS\_ORG# for a few days ago... for 249€. Today it costs 179€.
I find that very annoying to be honest. Do I have to cancel the order and reorder at a better price, or is there another way to get a refund?
I generally agree that children should not be expected to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I also think it's good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to some extent.
Looking briefly, helping briefly, bringing the bottle, etc. So they learn responsibility, help in the family, and are involved.
As long as they can still take care of themselves, I don't see a problem. If your K1 is okay with being alone for a short time, that's fine.
You can best measure whether it fits for your children. It is not the case that he should wind K2 and accompany them for hours while falling asleep.
In terms of law, it is probably questionable. Perhaps that is why the psychologist's statement is also questionable.
If something were to happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether that's a risk you're willing to take is, of course, up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book! I remember reading a crime/thriller a few years ago, and although I can still remember almost the entire plot, I can't seem to remember the title. Maybe someone here knows...
The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by drowning himself with food and going to his raptors' enclosure.
The case will be taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, discovers that the therapist he treats has a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety. The commissioner has a niece who also suffers from anxiety (about fire) and ends up at this therapist's clinic.
There is an increase in suicides and there is a new protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of a suicide and document it and post the photos on the internet. Ultimately, it is revealed that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where patients have a chip implanted in their brain that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients are ultimately forced to confront their fears to the extreme.
A woman jumps out of a window and another one intentionally goes to her death. This is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there is a big showdown at the clinic that had something to do with fire. That is roughly the plot, and I am pretty sure that the book was written by a French author/authoress.
If this story is familiar to someone or if someone can even tell me the title of the book, I would be very pleased.
Oh well, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available. I have to contact my husband first.
But that can take a while. What steps should I take afterward?
Is it also possible to get the price difference refunded?
Kind, 4 j., Splitter unter dem Daumennagel Kind, 4 years old, has wood splinters under the thumb nail (outside).
Have tried to remove him with tweezers. Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and caused harm. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left. Tomorrow I'll go to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm, which allows it to be installed in almost any locomotive of the track widths H0 and 0.
LokSound 5 Decoder are offered with all common interfaces and come with a 11x15mm large "Sugar Cube" loudspeaker with sound capsule assembly. Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multi-protocol decoder.
He masters the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix® and M4. In the DCC format, 14 to 128 steps are just as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thank RailComPlus®, decoders automatically register at an appropriate digital central station. It controls all DCC programming modes and thanks to RailCom®, suitable central stations can read CV values on the main line.
For Central Processing Units (CPUs) that can only program CVs for 1-255, there are helper registers. Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 steps at 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola addresses enable the triggering of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also makes it possible to reprogram the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx-compatible central stations. The LokSound 5 decoder recognizes Märklin® brake tracks just as well as ZIMO® HLU brake commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
The braking system with DCC brake blocks or with alternating current is also possible. In addition, it also works with a Selectrix® brake diode.
An ABC-pendulum automation allows automatic pendulation between two train stations. The LokSound 5 decoder can be used on analogue direct and alternating current railways.

Due to Omikron: Johnson will accelerate the vaccination rollout New Omikron cases are causing concern in politics and science in the UK.
Adults in England should therefore receive a qualifying vaccination offer for the New Year. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson aims to progress with COVID-19 booster vaccinations faster than previously planned due to rapidly rising Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second vaccination, said Johnson on Sunday evening in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens. So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate the vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing an emergency situation due to the Omikron variant, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccine protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the vaccination level could be increased with a third dose. "Let's boost now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omikron cases were registered in the UK, bringing the total to 3137. This is an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. dpa

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent out a job application.
Today, I received an invitation to a conversation via email. I will respond to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on where the person has a cultural background, it can be either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email. Could someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any bureaucrat's toes. Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books on them. 4 of them are going.
The only thing I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the cushion had a hidden defect at the time of sale. How could such a cushion defect occur after 9 months otherwise?
First tried on the #PRS\_ORG#. That works, but only since about.
4 days not anymore. Therefore, I have always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS\_ORG# but wanted to buy 8. However, there were none left.
Now they are available again, and I would like you to please add 2 chairs to the order and bill me for it.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content warning: I will be writing about domestic violence in detail here.
I have to write something about the soul. I (21) am often in contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A theme that really bothers me and unfortunately occurs far too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them. I am well aware that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a private conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving their familiar social environment, fear of taking away the children from that.
As I always want to make clear to everyone, it is sometimes very close to tears, but all of them are worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they do not have to endure violence.
Often, I wish I could help in any case... I know I can't. It will never be easier.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so unbelievably important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What use is the series to "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, an amazing design: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim At least, youngster Johannes Patrick was left.
Nothing again: For the second time within barely three months, the giants in Crailsheim have lost - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: "We still have some anger in our stomachs."
After the game, however, she did not relax but rather intensified due to the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone would have been disappointing, it was the manner of the performance that was particularly disappointing.
Let's say a statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The triple quote was only 13 percent, 4 goals (all from young Johannes Patrick) at a total of 31 attempts - any more questions? John Patrick's answer was: "We weren't concentrated enough after our victory at Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained."
Specifically, moving the ball. His counterpart Sebastian Gleim reacted quite differently: "What a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
It felt like it was in front of 10,000 people. However, on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their own expense.
Not only because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and led his team. "The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, the high performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed throughout the line. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total disaster and came within eight points after being behind 39:59.
Alongside Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored 12 points. Fortunately, there was no time for bickering.
Already on Wednesday (7 PM), the giants will receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, followed by a game in Ludwigsburg with a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered several months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and therefore contacted them again. We originally reported to them about half a year ago.
Just as peeled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59. He can captivate his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on tour with the program "Good morning, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear. Actually, Max Raabe should have celebrated his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
However, nothing comes of it. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "on official order" to suppress the Corona virus.
Other planned performances during the Advent season will also have to be postponed, as it says on the website of the singer, who turns 59 today, and his musicians (<http://www.palast-orchester.de>). From January, the artists will then make up for the already postponed concerts from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalian Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing much and gladly since his youth. In Berlin, he studied operatic singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with fellow students.
Since then, the Baron has established himself with his repertoire of schlager and chanson in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been frequently awarded with prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For Women It's Not a Problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with neatly combed blonde hair and paying attention to etiquette, Max Raabe from the current German-speaking music scene cannot be ignored. With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to get a small sample piece of the furniture wood in advance? It could be used to complement the existing furniture and we could check if it matches in terms of color beforehand.
It still doesn't work. I can only shuffle the cover sheet but not flip the pages.
Federal Minister Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing The new Federal Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations as demanded in a popular vote in Berlin.
According to Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday), "with expropriation, no new apartment is created, only the ownership structure changes." My goal is to provide tenants with security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years.
A colorful mix, such as private rentals, cooperatives, or housing companies, is actually the best protection against monopolization. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to set up an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not calm down, Geywitz did not rule out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rent brake until 2029, a limit on landlord increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rent cap.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as soon as possible. If the rental market does not relax despite this, "we will discuss further steps with the coalition partners," emphasized the SPD politician.

If the lamp is shipped in March, how long does the shipping itself take?
I have already cut myself on my finger. That is absolute rudeness.
At least 100 dead due to tornadoes in Kentucky. A devastating storm system has drawn numerous tornadoes across the USA.
Aline in Kentucky could have more than 100 dead to mourn. The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
On the night of Friday to Saturday, several tornadoes caused severe damage in the United States and possibly up to 100 fatalities. The storms left a trail of destruction about 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Its governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had passed through, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is difficult to imagine that this is even possible.
He calculates only in the state of Kentucky with up to 100 dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out. That is very unfortunate.
Is it still being produced? Or has it been completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this window in another country?
Until when do you want to report? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand, I can only order the cover now and have it shipped to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had returned an article via the contact form or submitted a return request and wanted to inquire if it had arrived or was being processed, as I have not yet received a confirmation.
Companies are paying vaccination bonuses and changing advertising slogans. While the federal government is rejecting proposals for a vaccination bonus, Austrian companies have taken the initiative and are offering their employees money bonuses for getting vaccinated.
By doing so, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and Economic Chamber, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination. Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - following the German model - is intended to increase willingness to get vaccinated against Corona.
He has switched companies, but that doesn't make his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea. It's been a year.
He has obviously not attached himself to his old position and has sought something else. That's okay too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, that's okay. He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please take the cancellation please. That would then be legally relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Help at first own campaign Boron for greetings!
I am currently guiding a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Griffin's Pass" and I want to lead my heroes seamlessly into a player-written campaign. We are playing DSA 5.
The big book is done, the villains and their motivations have been written, the individual acts have been devised, and now I am in the process of writing the starting adventure and stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes have to transport a wagonload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Sea.
The further development of the plot will take place there. A group of goblins will approach the hero a few miles from the village and lure him into a trap.
I want to give the player characters the opportunity to solve the confrontation in various ways: convincing, acting, threatening, recognizing the danger early on, whatever comes to the players' minds. Group strength: 8 ordinary goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.
Unnoticed, the goblins are waiting for the heroes in a narrow alley and are armed with bows on both sides of the wagon, while two with spears are stopping the wagon. If the battle comes and the heroes lose, I have two solutions.
1. The heroes will all be unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village mayor, a half-elf. Of course, the cart is gone.
1. If an unavoidable defeat is imminent, this half-elf intervenes with two of his knights and helps the heroes in battle. The cart is still there, everything is fine. 2. If an unavoidable defeat is unavoidable, this half-elf intervenes with two of his knights and comes to the aid of the heroes in battle. The cart is still there, everything is fine.
How do you justify using Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the Encounter too much of an entry point into the adventure?
The group Goblins will later play a crucial role, so they are not just cannon fodder.
I will certainly take note of many of your ideas and now also have more trust in my narratives.
I have taken the lamp apart again. And again, I have put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Therefore, I would like to send it back anyway.

I am bored with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has decreased so much that I need to vent a bit in this post.
First of all, the broadcast was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the start accident put the schedule far behind schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision!
It seems that for legal reasons, Formula 1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it's still stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race.
Nonetheless, a small compliment: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule misunderstanding among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag in F1.
Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both parties only came to the decision that Verstappen could change his tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton. At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that Verstappen had this option.
I am of the opinion that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on the F1 at a pay-TV channel. It is also not the first riddle that is now possible or prescribed according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the theme of rules.
Generally, Roos' artificial commenting style does not appeal to me, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. However, I genuinely find Heiko Wasser from RTL better.
There are constant idiocies that simply look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. Especially the latter causes a lot of chaos in the comment section, as he clearly does not take this seriously.
Not only does advertising take over at Sky, but Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV by listening without commentary after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these channels show less advertising during training than Sky, and as free TV channels. Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very sparse and full of repetitions. In general, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit the F1.
Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are allowed to broadcast, excluding advertising. So, the grand F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would be interested in your opinion.

Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and hasn't been delivered yet. I have contacted the chat twice and nothing has happened.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the second lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12, 2019. One of them has already shown a defect (the fabric has a hole at the front of the chair).
Please provide support.
Fan pumps are excellent for supplementing an aquarium with oxygen. It is also possible to operate a filter system using an air lift.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us. Look at the end of the offer in the table.
You can compare the performance there. If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate entire facilities with them.
If you have a large aquarium, it is recommended to use pumps with 2 or more outlets so that multiple air stones can be connected. The MK-series has 1, 2, or 4 outlets, depending on the model, but turbine pumps also offer the option to set an accent in the aquarium, for example, with a air curtain (find it in our shop) or with a decoration that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasure chest, shell or similar to name. The MK-series has a special, sound-insulated construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple. The blower pump is connected via an air hose 4/6 mm to a throttle valve or the like, and it can start right away.
The blower pump should be, or higher than the water level, and mounted externally. If the blower pump is lower than the water level, a check valve should be placed between them.
Simply cut through the airlock and place the vent in between. This would prevent water from flowing backward, so that if water were to flow out of the pool through the pump, it would not flow back into the airlock.
If the fan blower is installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture like other air pumps. The MK series pumps are pure powerhouses that consume little energy.
Even though we state the processing time as 3 days on eBay, packages are packed daily and picked up daily as well. Everything is running smoothly and very quickly.
We just want to take a step back so that no one gets upset, just because it took a little longer. It would be like, not everyone understands that all employees also work in logistics...of course, Corona doesn't stop here either.
Please don't rate me negatively just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the parcel services. Of course, people complain about these services, even though we are currently saying...they have it pretty tough.
This is also regionally very different. Don't be mean to anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Is it also possible to order the legs in a lighter color?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut daughter and moderator into space The daughter of the first US-American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers have embarked on a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The launch and landing of the around ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-decorated astronauts upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers one after the other climbed out and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds on their way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 Nasa astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company, while the other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space travel engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much they had paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley reminded herself of the mission of her father after the short flight. He had to work hard and make everything himself during his missions.
She was simply flown in, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan was enthusiastic.
He would like to return to space again, said the moderator. "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated. The capsule detached from the rocket during the flight reached an altitude of around 100 kilometers above the Earth, briefly experiencing weightlessness, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed.
The International Aviation Federation and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth to be the boundary of space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned spaceflight of Blue Origin: on the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, together with his brother Mark, a 82-year-old former US pilot, and a 18-year-old Dutchman.
At the second event in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous worldwide for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was present, as well as the former Nasa engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of driving the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without consideration for the climate.
By pressing a button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should permanently glow in a color or cycle through its entire color palette. When a color change is selected, the light stone maintains a light color for around one minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" lamp is weatherproof and can be used outdoors all year round. Even in snowy environments, its light shines particularly well - only a shorter lighting duration should be expected when the days become shorter.
Please pay attention in the winter only to the fact that no snow should impair the function of the solar module. The "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the current Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if necessary.

Someone who works or studies biochemistry I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject itself quite exciting, and in the laboratory, it doesn't bother me either (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I have also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, but at that time I also thought that I would definitely study until the doctorate and become. However, at the moment, doubts are coming to me, especially depressing me are the career prospects.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears great career prospects and the profession being highly sought after, on the other hand, one always hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would be really interested in:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
1. What have you studied/which training have you completed? 2. Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers! I am currently very unsure and am considering abandoning my studies in 2022 and pursuing a career as a computer specialist instead.
If you have any experiences, please share them as well :)
Extra stress during vacation and holiday weekends. This topic came up last week with me.
I have to use my long weekend now to relax. Therefore, here is a post about it.
Not only during major holidays, such as Christmas, is there a lot of stress in our operation. It seems that there is also a lot of stress on weekends and holidays.
It was like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which in Switzerland is called "Auffahrt". On Friday, most people and businesses take a half-day off, which is semi-officially recognized.
Last week, there was also a long 4-day weekend at home. So, what did last week consist of?
Stress everywhere. Too many emails that absolutely have to be dealt with before departure, order here, order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
If... yes, because "next week then" sounds so much time has passed and that shouldn't be the case?
Or is it because people want to accomplish so much in a shortened week as they would in a normal one? Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also quite annoyed.
What is the purpose of this self-isolation during holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?
The stress did not come from above, the colleagues were all very independent and self-sufficient. My question is simply: Are we like this, the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-evangelical style? Or do you know it in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but has not yet bought any gifts.
The beauty, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest, said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH. She will agree with the festival by baking and basting with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld. But before the sensible days, she still had some things to take care of: "For the first time, I don't have any gifts, I have to finally get things done."
NECTON-Bio supports a smooth flow of moult and feather regrowth. NECTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 µg Biotin/kg.
NETON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny plumage. The majority of feather damage that occurs in bird keeping is exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the feathers consist of protein-rich substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a flawless plumage. For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or unbalanced protein supply and/or inadequate provision of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feed is explicitly considered and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily administered through the drinking water or through the soft food.
Thank you, I found it but it still doesn't work unfortunately.
"a die F-Teile sind es, ich habe ein Bett von euch erhalten."
Unfortunately, there were problems with one part. The middle bar is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now? I can't build the bed.
The center beam is held by two feet, unfortunately these are faulty. The center beam does not fit into the intended holder.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided seems to be incomplete. Could you please provide me with the complete text or specify what you would like me to translate?
There are no flat ones. Those are the correct ones according to the assembly instructions, they were just too narrow.
But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
For me, they are not flat. Could I have received these?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential house fire with two lightly injured and significant damage Two people were lightly injured in a fire at a residential house in Upper Bavaria.
Furthermore, a estimated damage in the six-figure euro range has been incurred, as the police reported on Sunday. The fire probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital on Sunday with mild smoke inhalation. The exact cause of the fire was not initially known, but the police did not assume it was intentional.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But then it comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To refute fake news - Biontech CEO publishes vaccine photo Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
BioNTech CEO Uğur Şahin had not previously commented publicly on his vaccination status. Now, the entrepreneur has published a photo showing his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has motivated him to share this with us, said Şahin. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In social media, there were false informations that I allegedly was not vaccinated. Actually, my wife and I have received 3 doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
For several months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself being vaccinated in order to counteract false rumors. So far, I have declined because the communication should not revolve around me.
However, a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family have not been vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask for the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust. Fear can be difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
In the internet, there is a circulating interview with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clearly stated.
"At the moment, it is legally not allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin at that time. There is a prioritization in the vaccination of the vaccine in Germany.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly received the vaccine three times according to his own statements.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases probably also no heating.
A transformer station had caused a blackout. After a fire with severe damage in a transformer station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-Kreis in North Rhine-Westphalia had to go without electricity for around 24 hours.
On Friday evening at 41,000 affected residents and inhabitants in several communities, the lights went out due to a fire. Westnetz, the supplier, reported that numerous emergency generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was fully resolved late in the evening on Saturday.
Firefighters and helpers and helpers of the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered places of supervision in schools and called for neighborly aid.
The supplier apologized to the affected individuals for their patience and to the helpers for their effort. We are very aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions.
We also express our gratitude to the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their untiring effort, said the head of the department of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a message on Saturday evening. The repair of the damage will still take a few days, as Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily put some cables back into operation, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company statements. Electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 pm according to Westnetz's information has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear in the transformer station Neunkirchen-Seelscheid. There, extensive cleaning and repair work is required.
Parallel to that, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply has been restored.
Since Saturday 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again. Another 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid have been gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 23:15 hours, even the last affected individuals had power. Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies have been in action.
The authorities had called for neighborhood aid after setting up a backup power supply for important buildings on Saturday. They also urged citizens to take care of their elderly or lonely neighbors and to inform the local fire stations if help is needed, according to Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, according to government statements, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not care for themselves or who needed power-dependent medical equipment or medical care.
Good day! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it and pay in euros? It's the daily cover #PRS\_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you are also having a nice day and stay healthy ♡
I can't mount the underframe on the tabletop. It's a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions of it. We wanted to use table plates with a diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have a diameter of 15cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# came, but I cannot inlay it and thus shorten it. Can you help me further?
Otherwise, I would have to send them back, as they are not suitable for the intended purpose. I would be delighted to receive feedback.
That is really simpler! Then let's do it!
Could you please send me the return shipping label via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat.
Before purchasing, I did not restart the E#PRS\_ORG#. Should I do that now?
I find such a small font almost insulting. We are not satisfied with that.
Nordic combination: Riiber wins The German Nordic combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have sprinted to the podium at the World Cup in Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give in again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a big lead after the ski jumping event.
Translation:  Return of the order number #NUMBER# When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Both of us have updated it and are using version 4.5... it's possible that they may have heard of the problem before.
I directly bought a book with my #PRS\_ORG\_, it seems to be on it as well. When I try to open it, the message comes up, "ups!"
This document could not be opened. The file may be faulty. Please report it to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is a #PRS\_ORG# epub file. Can you help me further?
"Chat connection is gone and now? I have to work in between!"
In order for the paint to be applied evenly and cleanly, you should clean the parts with soap and water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse them with clear water, and dry them thoroughly. Before you use the brush for the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside of the parts or on a yogurt cup. The first stroke on the part  번역결과   후에 더 이상 보이지 않는 부품의 내부 또는 요거트 컵에서 할 수 있습니다. 부품의 첫 번째 글자
Apply the brush evenly stroke by stroke. The slight overlap of the color layers later ensures a uniform surface.
Avoid quick back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistic-looking areas.
In a model, there is no garden fence. Start with the bright colors.
The dark colors could otherwise shine later. Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
Previously, unpleasant metal streaks could occur when they mixed with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve a realistic appearance through decals or peel-off images. From national emblems on aircraft to ship names, ornamental stripes and license plates on model cars: decals give the model its final polish.
Bring the decals in the correct order while the parts are still accessible. An aircraft cockpit can be decal-ed or easier to apply before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as a knife, tweezers, and toothpick are when applying decals, patience and a steady hand. Cut each required decal individually and arrange them properly.
Decals are also called water-shedding decals because you moisten their reverse side with water until the carrier paper becomes dark due to the moisture. Then you stick the picture only a little bit from the paper and place it on the appropriate spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Note: Always check first if the image is sitting correctly before completely peeling it off the paper, so it doesn't stick, wrinkle or even tear.
Absorb excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years old.
I can only open a book briefly when I look for something else, then I can no longer read the book and have to log out and log back in and reload the book and search for the page where I left off. On Saturday, I already communicated with you.
Can I get this through email? Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came in three separate packages at my place.
Ok, despite many thanks! Then I'll buy elsewhere as soon as the money is returned.
Can I get rid of the problem?
Childbirth treatment with health insurance / What is a "insurance case"?  Hello everyone,  Translation:  Childbirth treatment with health insurance / What is a "insurance case"?  Hello everyone,
We were for some time in the treatment of children's wishes, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly stands in the way. The following:  Translation:  We were for some time in the treatment of children's wishes, now when it comes to billing with the PKV, this suddenly stands in the way. The following:
We had applied for the in-vitro fertilization procedure in advance at the PKV and received the commitment for up to three attempts. The attempts were not in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.) limited.
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was counted towards the PKV. A few months later, we tried to have a second child, but underwent 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, which were not yet counted towards the PKV.
We requested again the cost coverage by the PKV and were granted three more attempts. After a few more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed upon, logically the most expensive ones are counted with the PKV) we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received a bad surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV only wants to replace 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining two attempts of the first offer fall away. The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to AGB, "The insurance event begins with the treatment, it ends when treatment is no longer necessary." The questions for the experts in the round here:
Who has the right, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (we are entitled to 5 attempts)? * Would the PKV have had to point out to us in the contract that with a birth the further attempts fall?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance risk? Infertility (due to blocked fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts here could give their opinion. Thank you very much for your help!
Can you please send me the three variants via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
Okay. We won't be ordering from them anymore.
If they add up the transactions of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer. They can certainly pass this on to their manager.
That is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been initiated, but now you're telling me that I have to send the thing back first. I can't really do anything about it since the wardrobe was completely destroyed when it arrived at my place.
Please see the screenshot that my colleague has written. It is clear and distinct that the repayment was initiated, and I have not yet received a repayment per #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend has also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
Now we won't be doing that anymore. No, the defect only occurred after a few months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they are not allowed to sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless of that, the warranty is valid for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to provide a different type of packaging. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG# products. Are these products promoted with additional hooks that we cannot find with you?
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films.  What a low-budget film exactly is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
According to Wikipedia, a **low-budget film** or **low-budget movie** is a motion picture that is shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the internet, there are plenty of lists of low-budget films, such as on Letterboxd.com. Are there any interesting representatives of this category that you know?
What appeals to you about it? And what don't you like about it, perhaps?
As a very good customer of yours, I have already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is this now reliable? Thank you.
With friendly greetings There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes in the waiting position...I'll try again soon because it just doesn't work here. Hello
"Half Victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs, however, are very high and represent significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus-Poland and Lithuania border, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd). Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, explained the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP) to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
This state of suspension - Belarus does not give up entirely, but the EU feels like the winner - probably goes on for a while longer. The way of dealing with people at the border is not in harmony with the European Convention on Human Rights, judged Bossong.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole does not take a stance against it, this is at the expense of basic rights.
This development weakens the cohesion within the Union. "She can apparently not prevail if a member state insists on doing things its own way," as currently Poland, which even prevents the EU border protection agency Frontex from accessing the border.
In addition, the EU imposes another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, according to Bossong: A principle agreement on asylum policy would be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at crossing the border.
According to statements by Poland's border guard, migrants have attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus again. 55 migrants were detained overnight on Sunday and taken back to the border, a spokesperson for the authorities said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly thrown with stones by migrants near the village of Czeremsza. According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border guard registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have blocked border crossings. The EU has sanctioned Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
Furthermore, EU commissioners travel to countries of origin to prevent departures. The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on airlines, according to Bossong.
The EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures. Minsk must also consider internal political costs.
The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly checks thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale. Max Verstappen is said to have committed two rule violations during the race according to Mercedes' opinion.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal. The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
The protest refers to a supposed violation by Max Verstappen in the Red Bull during the last Safety Car phase, when he allegedly made an illegal overtake. A second appeal was filed against the result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed correctly. Verstappen overtook Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and won his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety Car phase, in which the Dutch driver in front of him had been overtaken.
I am checking it. I will speak with the bank and contact you again.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park hosts SC-Freiburg-Fantag. The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As the park announced, members and permanent cardholders of the Sports Club from the Breisgau, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on this day. Additionally, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster rides were illuminated with red and white stripes on this day. Foxle, Ed Euromaus and many red and white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
Already since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesliga club and the Freizeitpark in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. The first SC Freiburg Fantag at the Europa-Park once again showed how well the partnership fits.
Shining fans to see having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it, says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is it €#NUMBER# instead of originally 1699€?

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean anything. That's like when an AfD supporter says they have nothing against foreigners.
They will both deny it. But Kollegah constantly reproduces some kind of anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it be. Yes, then you are just as little taken seriously as Kollegah.
If someone seriously questions the fundamental principles of evolution, they are simply lost. Of course, God may have created everything.
But as soon as you become a creationist, you must believe that the Earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just a bunch of nonsense. And with that, you become a science denier and are not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal viewing field, the microscope should be brought as close to the eye as possible. The specifically apochromatic-achromatic designed lens system allows for practically distortion- and color-free use of the microscope up to the edge of the field of view.
Often, loupes are marked with magnification indications. However, these indications only apply to precisely defined conditions, which rarely correspond to the usage conditions.
In order to make the most of your loupe, we kindly ask you to take note of the information in the "Technical Data" table (see instruction manual in the packaging). Light reflections can occur on the surfaces of all optical devices, including at the insertion points.
By applying an anti-reflection coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When used optimally - with a loupe right in front of the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Christmas tree sale in Schönwolde: In the community of Krembz, women are looking for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers, and he has already experienced many curious situations during the Christmas tree sale.
Once a man even drove home without his partner because they couldn't agree. Every year, he plants around 2,000 of them for that.
Meanwhile, the 56-year-old has experienced many strange situations. That makes the pre-Christmas period always a bit funny, he says.
And what about the coupon? Otherwise, I'll be gone as a customer!
At least, I have received a defective delivery and now I have paid the full price for it. Then I will rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions about which dish is better here, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have therefore their name. In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Turner," which certainly doesn't sound as appetizing.
Problems with Glass Fiber + Devolo DLAN/Magic  We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks now.
Unfortunately, I am now having problems building a stable WiFi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which worked flawlessly with a few exceptions and received and transmitted 50 Mbit.
The new glass fiber connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also receive these. However, the other DLan module, which sends WiFi, no longer receives the full 500 Mbit, but the amount decreases the further I move away from the module (so use a power outlet that is located 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the Internet with the new fiber optic connection is now even slower on the first floor (~45 Mbit) than before. I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was certainly better than DLan, but here there were also similarly large losses. Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is lost over the power line with fiber optic cable?
And is LAN really the solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to run LAN cables in the house.
I am on the verge of despair, which is why I created an extra account here. Therefore, I would be overjoyed by a response.
When it's time to switch bank accounts, who would have thought that there would be peace at the giro accounts, but one is initially disappointed.
While many banks took advantage of the autumn to confirm the fee increases of the past to their customers with various tricks, the negative interest rates also continue to fall. For example, the Deutsche Bank was previously considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has halved the credit limit and even lowered the interest rate for savings accounts. In the first step, the limit was only reduced for customers of the corporate subsidiary Postbank - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
However, in the meantime, these lower thresholds apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed upon request. Not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the limit at ING Germany. The popular direct bank DKB has lowered the free amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At least: More than 100 banks have reached a credit limit of 25,000 euros or less according to figures from the internet portal Verivox by now. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also arrived at 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers, which have been granted legal rights by the first instance court in Berlin against this regulation.
Now, in banks, it is being discussed whether institutes should possibly create reserves - in case the upper authorities declare the negative interest rates in principle as unlawful and many millions have to be refunded to bank customers.
The table plate for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army. She is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
However, their life is like a mountain and valley journey. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. An entire army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of their appearance.
At least, Aniston, allow yourself a chip a day (yes, read correctly: a SINGLE chip from the bag). That your hearts still fly equally to both male and female fans is actually a miracle.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck - and is still looking for love. And she has crossed the baby wish off the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. That hurt her.
The people who asked don't have a clue what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful.
Stay hopeful that success and fame also bring happiness.
Unworthy End of a Career: Räikkönen Must Retire Kimi Räikkönen's retirement from Formula 1 was quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn took off his gloves and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That was it.
After a driving error and a minor collision, Raikkonen had to retire from the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix not even halfway through the race. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ended his career in the top class of motorsports.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children had traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Raikkonen's greatest achievement was winning the World Championship in 2007 while driving a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started 18 times from pole position and came 103 times on the podium. dpa
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in two-man bob - Sport The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 achievements is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
I have calculated that I would need to win nine and a half races per season in order to make it to Cortina 2026, said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who scored two victories in two days at the races in Winterberg. First, he repelled the attack of Johannes Lochner by five hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and pulled out a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the Brit Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We went for a greater risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after finishing second in the previous race. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach landed in eighth place after finishing fourth in the first race.
"If I only knew what he does differently, then I would also do it that way," said Lochner. Nolte with home victory - Podium for Jamanka
Laura Nolte scored her third season win in the two-man bob on her home track. After only reaching fourth place in the monobob the day before, she raced to a World Cup victory with Deborah Levi as her pusher on Sunday.
Two-time bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringia finished in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. She not only qualified for the Olympics, but also achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden resident Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig in third place. For me, it was super cool to finish on the podium in the World Cup, and I'm super happy that Mariama is joining me.
I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential, but the start times today were okay, said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, but there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not completely error-free trips, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the blanket already in my shopping cart and I could buy it now! What should I do?
I just didn't receive it and therefore couldn't pay it, which is why I finally asked about it. Due to Corona, I had other problems last year and never had the time for it.
And now it was said that it was over what really annoyed me. Take a look at the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I want to return it and then order it again because it's currently on sale.
Therefore, the shipping will only start on March 16th? There was nothing about such a long delivery time on your website.
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
Yesterday, it was taken from you by your colleague. Why is that a problem today?
I have also sent you pictures of the wrongly delivered items.
But we still want the shelf module, even a new undamaged one, and not the entire order canceled.
Only today, only this week, only until XY... Hello lovely ladies and girls and women,
I have something I just want to write, and maybe it will resonate with someone else as well... I am 24, have kPTBS, a full-time student, and dog mom - apart from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to kindergarten, he is essentially my child.
My friend (together since 6J) is sick, has a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel that we cuddle a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with the shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to a burn). He is also cold and we see each other less frequently (1-2 times a week) due to my needs for affection and love.
My dog puppy just has diarrhea, I just cooked for him and now he is relaxing in his cozy bed after I washed him with a warm lamp and stroked him. I live alone with my sister and mother, and my mother is away for a month.
Now the homework is also coming to us, which we of course divide. But even cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is currently well-established, I am almost well-treated and I am on the right track. Not well, but I am on the right track and almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot from me (which is a lot for me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I haven't prepared anything yet, and the day after tomorrow I have an Anatomy class for which I should at least prepare a bit. And next week, I have an oral exam on Wednesday, and what comes after that is in my calendar and not in my head because there's no room left.
My week is going like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But then it all continues?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the vacation.
Only until the weekend. Only until...
And so it goes on forever. I believe I'm just so stressed that I need these mental points of reference, otherwise I'll lose it.
Somehow, I feel guilty and "chaotic," but I can't seem to do anything about it... How about you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work. Truly infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived otherwise. I think that partly has to do with the mental load of women and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you at least a relaxing evening, the week is almost over!
I received my order today, unfortunately the whole color and surface is scratched and there is a table leg impression. With the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very excited!! What can you offer me?
If we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?
The cancellation email was sent on 26.12#NUMBER#. In total, it was sent twice.
However, it was not confirmed.
Mal was komplett anderes: I discovered in school that many religion teachers do not believe in God and it is for them just another subject like math or geography. For me it was always something strange, perhaps also because I was raised Christian and I always somehow believed.
How do you feel about it? Perhaps you can also tell me about it from the perspective of work or study colleagues with different postures.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is reasonable to separate them. It also provides a curriculum, etc.
But it would also be strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity. What would motivate someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Preserving culture or something like that? I hope your question isn't too personal.
Can it not be changed or not? Please write in English as I understand it well. This has been going on for a long time, and I would rather avoid it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a prompt response, at the latest by the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hallo dear people,  Please translate the following text from German to English:  Filmsuche Hilfe bitte Hallo liebe Leute,  Translation:  Film search help please Hallo dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24). I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, there is modernity (the real world).
For another thing, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely sure). Since I can't describe it anyway, there is a young woman.
And in the realm of the dead, there is a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers in Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a story ensues.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to survive, as I understand it. I believe the transition is also the tomb of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If that means anything to you, I am grateful for any response.
Our little one has slept only on the stomach from week 1. Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax. A child holds much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything around you is in order, no cuddly toys, go out and look more often, but no minute surveillance. That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress.
No pillows. Oh, and we never had pillows, but always a blanket.
Observe your child while it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Can it be positioned upright from the bottom? Or is it lying face down directly on the mattress?
Daran kannst du ableiten, ob alles in Ordnung ist. Wir sind auch alle groß geworden und als mein Mann zur Welt gekommen ist, war es zb Gang und gäbe, dass man die Kids auf den Bauch legt zum Schlafen.
Furthermore, we are already "Stammkunde" (regular customer) with you and have already bought many articles. But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written to a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received any feedback yet. It's about my wardrobe, which arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer does not fit in the cabinet. Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is not currently in use.
Let me clarify. RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held. And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's simply the case that this station's politics are currently under everyone's nose. Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then they still go on a big begging tour.
It was said that one is an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: We want to be "no running billboard".
What is it now? A 0815 advertiser trying to sell his merchandise to the elite fans.
And then we have Marah's Do's and Don'ts, of course, which apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, the people can continue to be insulted. A crook who lacks empathy and tries to make a mess of the rented premises at the expense of the action.
How do you find all of this? Great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
Please provide a callback, as my delivered wooden table is defective and has a broken corpus due to the damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
If as a comfort for an upset stomach or simply for snuggling - My little warm friend is versatilely usable. Cherry kernel pillows are a traditional home remedy for pleasant warmth applications, as cherry kernels absorb heat very well and can release it in a controlled manner.
The removable inner cover can be easily warmed up in the microwave or oven. The soft upholstery makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they are not feeling well.
The cushion with a connection is exclusively intended as a heat-insulating layer for the following application areas: Before heating the cushion on untypical odor, stains or branding, check for their presence and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cover for heating before inserting it into the microwave! Microwave at maximum 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (following the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!)
Distribute the heat evenly by shaking the quilt immediately after taking it out of the oven! Then put the inner quilt back in the cover.
At the first heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears after repeated applications. Always follow the recommended heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy inputs can lead to damage (fire and burning hazard!).
Check whether it is allowed to heat corn products in the microwave according to the manufacturer's usage instructions before heating the Kissen in the microwave. Once the heated inner cushion is placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the Kissen on your arm's elbow for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C).
Do not use the pillow for acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory disorders, fresh hematomas, blood ecchymoses and open wounds as well as for persons with reduced pain sensitivity. If you have existing skin, heart, venous, diabetes or tumor diseases or are pregnant, please consult a doctor before use.
If seams have opened and kernels have come loose, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and make them inaccessible to children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year of age, the baby's temperature should be regularly checked during application to avoid overheating!
All incidents related to the product that have occurred should be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority of the state in which the user is residing. The product is removable and can be washed at 30 °C in a machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after the second round - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf. Darmstadt 98 is allowed to dream of returning to the Bundesliga.
Meanwhile, Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone. For Ingolstadt, it's also not going well under the third coach.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed start under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead? Last night, my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) wouldn't charge through the power cord.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still work. I thought a power supply alone was sufficient to operate it.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop doesn't start even with the power cord plugged in. Therefore, I disassembled the battery, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas? I've ordered a new battery, but why can't I use my laptop in Wi-Fi mode?
Is there anything else broken? Thank you for your help!
I would like to have the delivery of #PRS\_ORG# brought into the room. How can I book that?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seat height is...
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? With the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design, no problem!
The 20 liter storage capacity can also handle larger photo accessories without any problems, as they can be safely stored using the padded FlexFold dividers. And whatever everyday objects you need, they will remain well-organized and separable from the photo equipment, thanks to practical approaches in the individually configurable interior space.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design has become a catchphrase - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack while still providing quick access to photo equipment.
It works with two options: conventionally through the flap, which can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, a highly thought-out solution for effective protection that has proven itself in Messenger bags. The locking flap has a metal locking lever with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has considered different "fill levels": there are actually 4 D-rings, securely riveted, into which the closure hook can be inserted. If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top ring, is it more empty, take a lower one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic. So the backpack can be reliably closed without having to insert the hook.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other backpacks, such as photo backpacks: In addition to the flap closure, there is also a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional backpacks with top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail greatly increases the everyday practicality of the backpack: If you not only take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage. In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus easily separate the two from each other - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while everyday items stay safely on the left side of the backpack and don't get in the way. Comfortable, uncomplicated adjustable straps help with that.
And the outer shell of the backpack is completely made of 100% recyclable, waterproof Nylon, so the contents will stay dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I was waiting in vain for the email from their support. #NAME# confirmed the assignment to me yesterday.
Announcement of contact from the shipping company for the collection of the wrongly delivered table. So far, I have not received any message.
Please proceed with immediate processing. I am now writing to the third support employee, and with none of them have I progressed beyond the promise to receive an email confirmation.
It concerns the return of the wrongly delivered custom order #NAME#.
It is unbearable to wait for the delivery of the wardrobe. Keeping it is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a pleasant evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on 12.1.21.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged furniture and not sent it back. And I couldn't have anticipated that the past year turned out differently than expected and couldn't properly settle and clear it up in a timely manner.
However, the damage I have suffered as a customer, I do not accept.

Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news spread quickly and caused the so-called "California Gold Rush" from '49 onwards. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma into one of the fastest-growing and flourishing cities in the country.
Areas were delimited, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels arose almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many, it was "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer searching for wealth in the West and trying to make a name for yourself.
You will be searching for gold, hiring workers, gathering horses, and building companies. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river courses and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers also have the same idea! You must outperform your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory. You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly works for you (known as "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, obtain additional actions, or apply rules in your favor. With these buildings and the dynamic tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma is played over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), and 1850 (the year in which California achieved official statehood). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their choice is revealed and they place their pawns on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a lock! This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up tents, searching for rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning gunfighters. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The roulette dealer turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions. This continues until the roulette dealer has moved five times, covering each location once and the year ends.
There is a shootout in which the players have to defend Coloma from a rampaging gang of bandits. If the players have enough revolver heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the cemetery. The game ends after the third shooting, then the final score is determined.
The player with the most victory points wins! With free shipping, I accept packages up to 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm in size, and the shipping method is a Warensendung (games included).
At everything else, DPD usually guarantees delivery with shipment tracking (games included, wrapped in bubble wrap and packed in cardboard). If you are a collector, I can also send the item in a cardboard box for an additional fee of 2 euros, which ensures that there are no pressure points on the item.
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Mediathek CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, power abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I have watched it immediately. > The children's psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a popular guest in talk shows and holds lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on education. Former patients and caregivers are now making serious accusations against him.
Please pay attention to the fact that the film is difficult to bear. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
It must never, never, never be about power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child space for its development and to create a framework for the child as big as it is reasonable and possible in the given situation.
Ugh, I'm still shivering.
Holetschek: Countries discuss removal of testing requirement for triple-vaccinated The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide removal of the testing requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We need quick clarity on whether and when vaccinated people can be exempt from testing three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag". The removal of 2G plus for triple vaccinated people is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive," said Holetschek.
German to English Translation:  Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to propose, "that he will make a suggestion to the Health Ministers Conference on Tuesday." - AFP
I also want to send the lamp back. How should I proceed best?
Hello, I really like the #PRS\_ORG# chair, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can't complete any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG#. Error message: Oh no, an error has occurred.
Shopping on the #PRS\_ORG# website via computer is possible. I have updated my account details.
Why might this be the case?
As you describe it, it is referred to as *Awareness*, which refers to sensory perceptions under full anesthesia. These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
The most common experience is hearing sounds/voices, rarely seeing images, and the least often feeling pain. Relevant for this topic: Caesarean sections are operations that are associated with an increased rate of awareness, as one avoids a very deep anesthesia until the birth of the child to protect the child.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the narcolepsy consultation. Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), come with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex has no awareness by definition. I have misread their comment.
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ help us not at all.
These are legal warranty claims. At the very least, they should take back the defective chair.
That is besides the legal obligation also a standard in eCommerce. Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We will sell the second chair privately. Then we will also lose some money.
I have already sent you an email that you have not replied to. Again, the question.
In the order and on the invoice, it is stated that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The carrier is Company #NAME#.
I am currently there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door - due to #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
Why wouldn't I be contacted? I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He became known as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on a Friday.
There lies the new book on the table, freshly printed: "An old man becomes older". The shattering diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle led until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I bear witness here already my life's gratitude."
There are different types of palettes. One of the most common ones are European palettes, standardized wooden palettes that are mainly used as load carriers in the European region.

Rolled Meat Tips & Tricks I received some great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
At Christmas, it was incredibly delicious and buttery! So thank you again for that :)
Now I have come to the taste and I want to cook rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I will set a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, but only a large pot.
How is everything going? What about the books? How can I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English is not as good anymore, but I'll manage.
The text is about a refund of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the refund had been made.
However, the money has not yet arrived with me. Could you please check that?
Where in Lübeck there is still Christmas roast beef available For many people, goose or duck belongs to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Have you not yet purchased any poultry? Time is running out.
We will tell you where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the heat and oil content of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN-, and MASTER VOLUME-regulators, you can set the desired level and at the same time adjust the distortion of your sounds. Furthermore, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "Gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that one can even create a performance reserve with the POWER LEVEL regulator, even when it gets unbearably loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in any situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. The signal here is processed with a box simulation so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression even when using headphones or when recording directly.
To the AUX input, a CD or MP3 player can be connected so that you can listen to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board - you therefore do not need a separate volume control.
If someone spends additional money on a VFS5 footswitch, they can comfortably call up sounds using their foot, toggle the effects blocks on and off, and adjust the tempo of the accordingly compatible effects "tap". For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
However, I have seen it differently with others. Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
Because it is too low for a dining table? So I would like to send it back then.
Can you help me further?
And the wardrobe? Can we get an update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you already sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a discount or voucher. Under certain circumstances, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
Only over 1,000 euros for things I don't need, that's a bit much.
I just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG# Spiegel (door) mirror on the intended hook.
That is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status with you?
Iran is seeing progress in negotiations over the nuclear agreement. According to Iranian sources, progress is being made in the negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
Both sides are close to agreeing on the topics that should be on the agenda, said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna. This is a "positive and important development," as there was initially no agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement should prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. On Thursday, negotiations to revive the agreement were resumed after a brief interruption of almost a week.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations. A US delegation is also present in Vienna, but they are only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia has overtaken Saxony - the Free State is now a federal state with the highest Corona incidence. Thuringia has now overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest Corona incidence in Germany.
As the only federal state, the value is above 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had a Corona incidence above 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had always shown the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but was still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to an infection were reported within a day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill COVID-19 patients were intensively treated in hospitals. On weekends, there can be reporting delays.
Furthermore, the health authorities have been overwhelmed for weeks and are barely able to keep up with the registration of new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery is not until early March, it may be possible by then.
I have to print it and stick it on the package and hand it in at the post office, is that it or not? Here, I don't have to click/enter/fill anything else, right?
Exactly what I want to avoid, that's why I'm writing to you. I would like to request that the return shipping be billed to me.
8 euro return shipping fee is, in my opinion, an insult.
It's time for changes.  Welcome to the meeting, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the post office here for? If one looks at the activity in the past months of the MBundestag, it can be established: it does not exist.
We have come to a winter standstill and have extended the summer hole for several months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what's the issue? It seems to mostly be related to dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong and we're generally struggling.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here are really looking forward to the MBundestag. #What we need to change
At this point, the community around the Bundestag is being asked who wants to keep this alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who has become aware of this project in recent days and found a pile of broken pieces.
After some back-and-forth communication, several people from the community have come forward who want to rebuild the project. However, I would also like to explicitly call upon everyone to participate, only in this way can the project continue to exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server by clicking on this link.
Goals:  * How should the Bundestag function in the future?
Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed? How will we appear to the outside world in the future?
* How can new members be recruited? * How do we create a fair voting system?
I am fairly sure that I have forgotten some things, which is not bad, we have the Discord at the end. If you have the desire and time, come to the Discord, work together and let us democratically decide about the future.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you that has not yet been delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different hanging system from you.
I put it together and noticed it then when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it.
I hope this is returned and I receive a full refund. This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is darker than expected.
I have a question: does the daily schedule #PRS\_ORG# also come in larger sizes, such as 240/240 for example?
PRS\_ORG must be able to guarantee that the faulty wardrobe will be collected promptly. And I kindly ask you to arrange this now.
I don't have an appropriate packaging, but I will disassemble the shelf as much as possible for pickup. They need to clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how this will work. #PRS\_ORG# can always contact me by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time would I need to assemble it or decide on returning it?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? Today, I had a conversation with a colleague whom I would like to like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, eats current
When asked if I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. And the truth is, I used to think that as a vegetarian I would be supporting animal welfare, but eventually I reflected and understood that I was ultimately supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. In that moment, I had the impression that dissatisfaction was rising on their side, they then defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and as vegetarians, they could reduce animal suffering.
I am wondering if my answer to "plump" was correct? How do you answer this question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan one is quickly pushed into a corner and conflicts arise without one wanting it. It greets a harmonious-loving vegan woman (;
It is not a unique exception under § 312d BGB. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I am the assigned date on which #PRS\_ORG# is supposed to collect my return not in person. Unfortunately, I cannot be present in person because of a funeral, so this cannot be changed either.
Can you please assign me an alternative pickup time? As of 01.02.#NUMBER#, I will be consistently available again.
The Lahnstein defense for water rescue is prepared: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state Recently, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of the Interior, Roger Lewentz, handed over a subsidy decision in the amount of 45,000 euros for the new equipment vehicle of the voluntary fire brigade Lahnstein at Mayor Peter Labonte in the Lahnstein town hall.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, was 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in safety.
I'm glad that the country of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us here", says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein. The diving vehicle is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
They fulfill tasks on and under water in water and ice rescue, as well as in technical assistance. In Lahnstein, permanent increases are expected: the boom of hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started. I can't open the book.
Despite following their recommendations, synchronizing, removing, and reloading the app did NOT work. I am quite frustrated because this whole process has already cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Okay, then. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS\_ORG# for June.
Can I enter a date in the order process?

Thank you first of all for standing up to this whole thing, I have also spent almost a decade in a similar job in the civil service, i.e. we were also armed guards in the executive branch, let's not go into further details. I always find the question of right and left oversimplified.
Generally, one should say that naturally the civil servant comes from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone. Of course, it is also clear that uniformed and armed people on the right might naturally attract conservative people, but it should also be clear that these people have difficulty dealing with reality, especially since there are now many people with migration backgrounds, women, and even homosexuals (and I don't mean the exaggerated stereotypical gay men, but rather normal men and women whom you wouldn't notice if they didn't tell you). And on these people, I have to rely, because in the end, they might save your life or set it up for you.
But even these peripheral groups also represent a conservative stance, according to my experience, although it may sound strange at first. They are proud of Germany and feel themselves less affected by overly left-wing policies, even though these policies are supposedly meant to help them or right what they perceive as wrong. They simply want to be treated normally. As, of course, the police and the armed forces are a cross-section of society, one will also find extreme right-wing views there. However, it is medially exaggerated that they are allowed to openly express their opinions or even openly plan any state-endangering plans.
Naturally, it happens that even police officers and soldiers who were often deployed abroad also start to generalize and sometimes say things that are controversial or politically incorrect. Of course, it also happens that right-wing compatriots meet who engage in a lively exchange of ideas.
Nonetheless, such things are effectively combated and countered with political education and enlightenment! Germany is so internationally entangled, and that is also in my opinion a good thing, because we simply couldn't afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, if there's something I don't understand, I've also ordered the other basket from the German side. Why should it come from England?
When I called, it wasn't sold out. I had already booked in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order.
It's still about my order that is no longer available. I previously chatted with #NAME# about it.
Alternatively, one could deliver the other #PRS\_ORG# crate for #NUMBER# euros in black to Germany or check if the crate is available somewhere in Germany. I only find you as a partner company.
but there are two deep grooves at the top of the wooden part that are filled with something yellow and on the mirror itself, there is a small scratch
Ordinary for a child? Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with something for a longer time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (independent, very little free time), but throughout my life, I have always had trouble maintaining a clean and orderly household on a permanent basis. There are always phases in which everything stays lying around, and then every now and then, it hits me, and I tidy up and clean.
But it's not really "that someone could drop by spontaneously." My husband (unfortunately) isn't better either. It bothers me somewhere, but he usually loses household against work and laziness.
The kitchen is regularly cleaned because we like to cook. Now, have you managed to become organized with your child?
We don't have any yet, but we're working on it and this question has been bothering me for a longer time. Because for me, I don't have any motivation, it simply doesn't bother me as much as long as no visitors come and, for example, there is always fresh clothing available and the kitchen is usable.
Should one have a greater incentive or remain careless? I'm looking forward to your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality anatomically pre-formed cut offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit, and enables almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-forming with special, deeper pressing at the joints for improved mobility (at arm- and knee bending)
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled at the Flex System to further increase comfort. Nose-less stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, arm and knee bends).
High-quality pre-shaped contours in the lower back and in the step ensure a snug, perfect fit. The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar area increases flexibility around the back closure and thus improves comfort, particularly when bending and mounting and setting up equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and back ensures increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that offers a high degree of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body. Seamless, thin (-2 mm) padding at the face on the helmet increases comfort, padding, and durability (separate headgear)
Flexible, gentle adhesive tape improves the sealing in the collar area with an adjustable fine-tuning by a flexible, gentle adhesive tape that does not adhere to the concealment or the seams, double cuffs with a zipper at the arm and ankle joint connect a flip-up inner cuff with a soft, neoprene outer cuff.
5° Reinforcement at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and durability when pulling. Long zipper at the neck with an elastic skin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort in the overall without hood.
Long G-Lock P back lever release (overall without hood) with metal lever and integrated water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent) release on arms and legs.
Reinforcements at all ends of the zippers to prevent tearing when excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels bonded with outer and inner overlapping.
Edges of the outer straps decorated for greater durability Edges of the inner straps embossed for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially at deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist computers).
Career in social work - as someone with a self-assured personality disorder? I have completed an education in software development and have been out of school for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been thinking about starting over and studying social work for a long time. The problem is that I have a self-doubting (or anxiety-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
To put it roughly, it means that I don't have a sense of self-worth and as a result, I am shy. I have no problem talking to people on a practical level, but it is very difficult for me to engage in casual conversations and I have been told multiple times that I come across as aloof (which I think I have already improved upon).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as substance abuse counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the actual workday is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet. The ÄVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it always brings me down when there are issues with my code ("just the simplest things messed up again") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do it"/"I'm holding him back with my stupid questions"/"he must think I'm really incompetent" etc.).
I will likely have problems in any profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
But have you already held onto the sofa? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for an appointment for pickup. What do you mean by returning it, please?
If I download a book on the #PRS_ORG#, does the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorized this book is there a problem?" appear?
I was chatting with #PRS\_ORG# and they asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken up with the feed is broken down by the bird in its gastrointestinal tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids). From these, the bird builds again its own protein components, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestlings and feather regeneration in moulting birds are extremely complex processes and are associated with a particularly high demand for the entire animal's organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding as it may cause disruptions in the breeding process. After the brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, the daily vitamin supply should be resumed with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 g NEKTON-Bio per 250 ml water or 100 g soft food. It is recommended to prepare only as much water/food as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
In a pinched teaspoon (lying down), 1 g NEKTON-Bio corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. At the beginning, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the approach of feather regeneration becomes visible.
After the normal dose is measured until the feather regeneration is completed. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry without sunlight, between 15°C and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is being sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break down after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged upon arrival and pictures were attached. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in opposition to the bylaws  Hello r/LegaladviceGerman,  As a community member, I would like to express my disagreement with the bylaws of the community. I believe that the rules and regulations set forth in the bylaws are too restrictive and limit the freedom of individuals within the community.  I understand the importance of maintaining order and ensuring the well-being of all members, but I feel that the bylaws go too far in restricting individual rights and freedoms. I believe that a balance should be struck between maintaining order and allowing individuals the freedom to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit.  I would appreciate any advice or guidance you may have on how to address my concerns with the community leadership. Thank you for your time and consideration.  Sincerely, [Your Name]
I have the following problem. A walnut tree needs to be felled on our property.
Application submitted to the community. An employee informs me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
However, the walnut is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree in the bylaw. Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On the one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the bylaws are clear and unambiguous.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message. No problem, I still have a sofo without use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a coupon? What were they more expensive?
Yes, I can help you with that. Here's the translation:  "Yes, I think so, the question is whether I can pay in euros and have the roof shipped to Germany. Can you check that?"
Notification: Serious traffic accident in Selb A serious traffic accident has occurred on the St 2179 between the exit Selb-Nord and Plößberg.

Okay, I understand. Thank you very much, it was so easy!
Merry Christmas to you all!  Rat and ideas for further professional life  First of all, I would like to wish you all a happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year. As we approach the end of the year, it is a good time to reflect on the past 12 months and to think about the future. For many of us, the past year has been challenging, and we have had to adapt to new circumstances and ways of working. However, it has also been a time of growth and learning, and we have gained new skills and experiences that will serve us well in the future.  As we look ahead to the new year, it is natural to think about our professional lives and what we want to achieve in the coming months and years. Some of us may be considering a change of career or a new direction in our professional lives. Others may be looking to develop existing skills or to learn new ones. Whatever your goals may be, it is important to have a clear idea of what you want to achieve and to have a plan in place to achieve it.  One way to gain clarity and direction in your professional life is to seek the advice of a career counselor or coach. They can
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about. Before I continue ... briefly: I need advice and, ideally, from people who somehow know my situation - so from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a newcomer. Originally, I studied something else and worked in that field (to at least have some anonymity, I don't want to reveal anything more specific).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun. Eventually, I ended up at the teaching profession and was sure that's what I wanted - even though the framework conditions are significantly less flexible than in my previous job, but that didn't matter to me.
I am now at the third "I Google other job listings." It has been half a year.
Before the paintings, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the ref. After that, I can still turn around. But right now, I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now, although it is vacation, there is still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the ref, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but then my weekend was also my weekend and my vacation day was my vacation day. I had free time.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in the moment. Now even the family celebration is too much stress for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that annoy me even more. Basically, it's fun and the feedback is good from an external perspective.
But I am completely exhausted and I wonder how much stress my body can withstand before it completely shuts down - if it hasn't already. I wonder if I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some contributions from you - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, had the freedom to take time off when I needed it, and worked together as a team on something, rather than being a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I wonder if I won't be back in the same place a year from now and be unhappy again. You notice, it's all a bit chaotic, but perhaps you as outsiders have advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation where I'm completely finished and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make decisions right now, as I am feeling very emotional at the moment. This is likely to lead to nothing good. But perhaps your views will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and excuse the whiny tone from me. I hope my situation has at least become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has constantly evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuitry, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET-Technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amplifier circuits, the VTX-amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amplifiers also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This partly relies on genuine analog circuits, as these are better at capturing the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which led to a performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they need here.
All guitarists dream of the drive and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that it is primarily the output stage that determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed, based on this finding, the VOX Valve Reactor technology.
The valve reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner: Magic lose to Clippers The losing streak series of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven points from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The large main compartment is also adjustable: with three individually placeable and foldable Velcro closure parts, it adapts entirely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format reflex cameras. What ultimately fits into the backpack, of course, depends on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible configuration could be a DSLR camera with a telephoto lens, two to three zoom lenses, and a flash unit. Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or the Fujifilm X-T2 still have room for more lenses.
Furthermore, you can also store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and for non-photographic items.
Even drone pilots find a perfect match with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers sufficient space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: probably the longest in history. In the nearly three months since the eruption began, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is there an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary island.
Until now, the eruption of the volcano Tehuya in 1585 with 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. No reliable data are available on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the still nameless volcano in the Cumbre Vieja has decreased somewhat in recent days, but volcanologists dare not make a forecast as to when it might end. The indicators point to a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable, said President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE. Damages in millions.
In the three months since the eruption began, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2900 homes and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares have been covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
Almost 1,700 football fields. More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damage is estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Before the coast, two new land formations were created by solidified lava with a total area of approximately 50 hectares. The banana cultivation, which is of immense importance to the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants directly or indirectly depend, was particularly affected. The cultivation was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
25 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were severely affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts are at the door, and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree have a seductive quality due to the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension. Christmas belongs to one of the few traditional occasions that still hold our increasingly divided society together.
So important is it to be aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "society-stabilizing 'contract of natural peoples'" that brought peace, can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life within the context of this tradition. Just as Nicholas became the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days with gift-giving. Prior to that, gifts were exchanged on St. Nicholas Day in various ways.
The background of this still popular custom is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw gold into the windows of three women one night to save them from a life of sin. From this unconventional form of giving arose the popular custom in Germany of filling children's shoes with gifts, especially in the form of gold-filled boots.
Protestants object to this practice because they reject the "Holy Worship" as mediators between God and humans. For this reason, they resist the institution.
Martin Luther transformed St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and established a new tradition line. The focus of gift-giving shifted accordingly to Christmas Eve.
Since most Protestants no longer see such details so strictly, it only annoys the fewest that the custom of St. Nicholas, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession, is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas season. Today, one finds everything from socks in front of the door to luxury watches under the Christmas tree, all that one's heart desires.
Diversity in traditions in Christian countries sources attest to a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of St. Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, there is a joyful confusion in all Christian-influenced countries about who will bring the gifts to the children now.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a kind of Nikolaus with some unique features. This includes, for example, his white fluffy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and the preference for the chimney, in order to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure on Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give the gifts, while in Italy it is the Witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought some fame. Here, it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull the sleigh.
In the Czech Republic, the motherland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christkind is responsible for delivering the gifts.

I haven't bought another e-book from #PRS_ORG# yet.
I have requested a return shipping label for my order #NUMBER# last week and this morning. I was told that one would be sent to me.
Since I have not received any either (not even in the SPAM folder), I would now like to inquire about how long this usually takes. Thank you very much.
Police shot a suspected bank robber near the Kensington Palace in London on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had informed them of a man with a weapon entering a bank and a bookkeeper's business. According to the authorities, the man fled in a vehicle that was stopped by police a short time later.
It were shots fired, and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene.
The police did not assume a terrorist background. There are several messages located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.

The decorative light fits harmoniously into any bed, garden area or stone garden. The light is simply placed and can be anchored with 2 earth spikes in the ground.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 Watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery. Maximum illumination time: 10 hours.
The robust plastic execution is usable year-round outdoors. In Hollywood speak, it is usually dangerous objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with colorful light.
However, "Smart Stone" is different: Only the sun ensures that this solar light fascinates - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The angular, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a large pebble shaped by nature, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the gravel bed. He also looks good in the vicinity of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself due to his size.
You can save yourself a lot of work: As a solar light, "Smart Stone" does not require a power supply or batteries. Just place the "lightstone" on any sunny spot outside.
Two included ground spikes provide a secure hold when needed. The matt white plastic housing itself is robust and weatherproof.
His solar module hides "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colorful light. The battery charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
"Smart Stone" starts to automatically light up as dusk approaches; in which color, that's up to you: You have six attractive light colors to choose from, besides daylight white - the automatic shut-off occurs when the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts the next day from the beginning.
I have already done it multiple times, but it doesn't work.

Pillenproblem Hello dear womenfolk,  (Note: "Weibsvolk" is an old-fashioned and somewhat derogatory term for women. A more modern and respectful term would be "Frauenvolk" or simply "Frauen".)
I hope I'm doing everything correctly. It's actually my first post on reddit after a year. To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had incredibly bad pain during my period and PMS before my period.
Now I would like to stay, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I can't choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had gotten at my last approximately two-year pause from 0 to 100 explosively pimples and these everywhere. So superficial, but it really bothered me and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year break, nothing really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips on how to avoid this again.
My cosmetics are already perfume-free and without dyes, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me. Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and I still have to make an appointment with the dermatologist.
Thank you very much to everyone who read the novel! Oh, the love of the skin is such a thing.
Had Vorbupertär severe neurodermatitis, then a period of rest, then widespread impetigo and the acne topic. I have also tried everything in terms of nutrition during my Christian illness and ended up on a diet low in sugar, milk, and meat, because nothing else worked as well.
It can also be the case that hormonal contraceptives just have the worm in them, but if you want to avoid complications, it's better not to look for anything else that might be wrong.
I had already written everything to my colleague's seminar o. ä. and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my concern.
I have to keep working in between and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money were there? I would have seen it. Please check my bank details, maybe there was something wrong.

In the name of the people: Laypeople deliver judgments. In the courtroom, they sit in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
However, their judgment depends on many factors, even if they do not wear a robe: lay judges decide with professional judges whether and for how long someone goes to jail. Two of them report in an interview with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht an der John-F.-Kennedy-Straße.
Hello, unfortunately, I am unable to access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice from order number #NUMBER# one more time to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have the option to store it for so long.
We would use the table as if it were offered to us by them, as if it were ours.
Sure, here's the translation:  "Already in November of the same year, I had ordered two in blue and received them. Therefore, I would like to have one in gray now."
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for pickup and return? And when would the pickup be?
10-kV earth cable will be newly built in 2022 The authorization for the placement of the new high-voltage cable at Tann is legally valid.
The decision by the government of Lower Bavaria paves the way for the construction to begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk today.
The approximately seven kilometer long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the northern part of the community with the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a pylon of the overhead line near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only arrived in part with us.
The blue delivery number: #PRS\_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was sent back by #PRS\_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next process is? A great start to the week!
You can forget about that, I have already explained it several times yesterday! It is a glass commode, and all sides are covered with glass, so there is glass everywhere, and the cardboard is broken.
The commode is in my apartment and #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS\_ORG# regulations. This means that the commode cannot be picked up because no one is allowed into my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is the case with all books, which is why the request is made at #PRS\_ORG# since it probably involves a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues,  Ref: Planning lessons (EK)  I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you today to discuss the planning of our lessons for the upcoming school year. As you know, it is important that we provide our students with the best possible education, and in order to do so, we must ensure that our lessons are well-planned and well-prepared.  I would like to propose that we hold a meeting to discuss the following topics:  1. Goals and objectives for the upcoming school year 2. Curriculum and subject matter to be covered 3. Assessment and evaluation methods 4. Teaching methods and strategies 5. Resources and materials needed  I believe that by working together and sharing our ideas and experiences, we can create a plan that will help us achieve our goals and provide the best possible education for our students.  Please let me know if you are available to attend the meeting, and if so, what dates and times work best for you. I look forward to hearing from you soon.  Best regards,  [Your Name]
I have been at Ref since summer, teaching is fun, but I currently have big problems with time-efficient planning of my geography lessons. Unfortunately, my school is technically not well equipped, so I can basically only use the blackboard, the schoolbook, and an OHP as media.
In school, I can also copy s/w for free (which bothers my geography teacher). I currently need a lot of time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently discussing the topic of geofactors, and for me, every hour stands for itself. In principle, the methods always repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I also do not want to invest too much time for simple teaching hours (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
When planning, I usually start from the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (usually I create an worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book, I am rather dissatisfied.
Therefore also the worksheets. Perhaps a geography teacher can tell me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would be truly delighted.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from order #NUMBER#. Although I have actually decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, I would like to process the return as soon as possible.
The trade is afraid of the 2G regulation for Christmas business. In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered can enter.
The trade considers it unnecessary and laments sales declines. A possible solution he also has at hand.
The 2G regulations are killing the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE) for the retail trade. Umsatzeinbrüche should be expected for businesses with non-daily necessities, criticized HDE Managing Director Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 100 retailers, more than 70% of the companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many would have written off the Christmas business already.
As actually the positive peak of the year should be, it is often a hole without a bottom, said Genth. Traders with 2G access restrictions lost accordingly in the past week almost a third of their turnover.
The product is only available in the food retail trade and online. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the managing director. "2G shopping does not bring us any further in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel deployment. He demanded that the bandage regulation be nationwide approved.
After that, each customer should only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would have access to all stores with the wristband received on that day. In addition, in retail - as already in public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested) - random sample checks should be sufficient.
The real estate company specializing in shopping centers, Deutsche Euroshop, also spoke of difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last without 2G at around 75% of the pre-Corona level, and the sales at around 90%.
"These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the most important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to the "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and permits will be obtained for the centers.
The so-called "wristband solution" is being considered, where "visitors, for example, would have to present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then - equipped with a wristband similar to those in a club hotel - be able to enter all shops unrestricted." dpa
I recently ordered the #PRS\_ORG# and received it. The mirror has a scratch and there is also an error on the frame that was attempted to be covered with a yellow filler.
It looks ugly. I would like to return the mirror and I have already packed it back into the box and taped it up.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance construction, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high performance and high color rendering. To set the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities is used.
Besides adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually set and save the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the Flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitive to operate.
The lamp generates a very high light flow with soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The 120-degree radiation angle allows you to illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, which is excellent.
By the way, you can also adjust the brightness in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work with both on the film set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a lit display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percentage and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Furthermore, there is a slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery) for the user storage. The storage has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To set the individual settings on the storage locations, simply press and hold one of the storage keys, and it will be saved. The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
One of the biggest advantages of the DL3120 functionality is the ability to operate with affordable NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before setting whether the batteries have sufficient performance - there is a battery tester built in - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in the two display screens (the left battery upper display, the right one on the lower display). In addition, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the headlight with power through the included power supply.
The construction of the flashlight is very simple. It has a 16mm thread for mounting, so you can attach it directly to your photography tripod.
The inclination can be reliably established using measuring instruments on both sides. It has been taken into account that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and therefore also designed for durability and hard use.
In addition, a ball joint is included in the delivery. Great that a bag is also included in the delivery.
So you can safely transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you may want to purchase without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received it as a gift and it's too small :(
"Party, that we wanted to spit on": Frankfurt celebrates after a thrilling comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last twice in a row winless Hesse seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga relegation. But then the SGE turned around, shot off their frustration over a disappointing season start within an hour and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys have accomplished today," cheered trainer Oliver Glasner at DAZN and gave a "blanket compliment" to each individual who was there, saying, "It's insane what the guys have accomplished today."
Initially, it looked like another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which was still ranked ninth despite their high expectations. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen in a commanding 2:0 lead.
What happened then also impressed the SGE coach. "As the players returned and showed a fantastic performance," Glasner continued.
I am crazy happy with the performance we showed and, of course, with the result. Defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game and overcome his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
I believe our mentality is incredibly great, said the 27-year-old and rejoiced with a glance at the result, particularly for the spectators. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but sees himself well positioned in terms of the personnel situation. It is extraordinary that all players are fit in December and all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live highly professionally. Now we want to "step by step proceed and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
As next, on Wednesday during the English week, there is an away game at Borussia Mönchengladbach (7:30 PM, Sky) on the schedule.
I received the email that my package is being returned to me due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# to have it redirected, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent to me again directly or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is placed again? Unfortunately, that would mean I wouldn't order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Dampener for handball women before the quarterfinals against Spain Germany's handball women slipped after the humiliation against Denmark with hanging heads and empty looks from the court.
For the conclusion of the World Cup main round, the DHB selection collected a harsh defeat at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 spectators in Granollers and must now run against host Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," concluded national coach Henk Groener.
We need to approach Spain differently. After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points as the second place behind Denmark (10:0).
It's unfortunate that we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game that we need to erase, said Captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for entry into the semi-finals, there must be a significant improvement on Tuesday to keep the delicate dream of winning the first medal since 2007 alive. The best German female thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither on the attack nor on the defense," Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "We must now quickly look ahead." From the front to the back, not at the height
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at their best at the start. Misses and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at full operating temperature and prevented worse with a few parades. The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counter-attack.
The expected ignition was not this. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly stage a scene - and if they did, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt at the gate of the Scandinavians.
So the game ended at 3:10 after 20 minutes due to an early start, especially since midfielder Mia Zschocke had to leave the game later due to a hard foul by her opponent, resulting in a red card for her. However, she will be able to participate in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the DHB selection start to play better and until the break, at least they had reached five goals. The already quiet hope for a comeback after the substitution was already gone after seven minutes with the score at 9:19.
The Greens' offspring again sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent who counts among the medal candidates at the end. As a result, the German team could not muster the necessary performance boost and left the stage as a clear loser.

How is it going with them?
The title is there, I am a mobile pharmacist working in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far only) the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is mainly administered in nursing homes. Since these are about to be completed, it will now be my turn to go to vaccination centers for me.
I would gladly answer questions without a time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personal (e.g. "I take medication X, does that conflict with the vaccination..."). Within my area of responsibility is the education on vaccination, the indication (the person has a right to a vaccination according to the Corona vaccination regulations and has no reasons against it), the medical documentation, and potentially the emergency care in case of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me before).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical staff. However, in vaccination teams, we often do not have a doctor there, but only pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot perform vaccinations themselves (can they?), so that I also have to perform most of the vaccinations myself.
Heavy question: Amberg knows the solution. What is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent by an Amberg resident, there has been ensured hefty thinking in the BR television show "We in Bavaria". However, unlike many previous days, the term in the series "Host mi?" was not guessed by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And neither was anyone who "has to move everything quickly".
As people heard from the TV presenter, it was completely wrong. The man from Amberg revealed the solution and thus probably caused amazement among many Upper Palatinate residents.
The announcer, the audience learned, is a cloth used to wipe the stove. Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted by Bavarian Television as an expert for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typically Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more familiar dialect word "Houdern". With the closing of an educational gap, perhaps also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for the past 2 weeks. After confirmation, I always receive the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG#, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing helped.
Is tire choice when cycling really as safe as advertised? This morning, I woke up full of determination, eager to at least train a little for my upcoming cycling tour.
Said, done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were also really nice - but then what happened, which always lurks in every city center (this time: Krefeld!) occurred.
Shards of glass on the road. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire did not want to continue the rest of the road on no account.
Because of the day of the week, I didn't have a real opportunity to get a spare raincoat and spare tube, so I had to turn around with somewhat bad mood and take the first train home. It wasn't technically that bad either, maybe it's better if I practice the tire change before the bike ride again.
Now I am standing before a question and hope that you can help me. As I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would very much dislike having this problem repeatedly.
Now it's really not bad, because the old tires from the previous owner (a very nice old man who had 140km on them when I picked up the bike at 10am!) were also considered suboptimal because he had been riding on them for several years. But when I think about the fact that I still have to change the tires after 80-90km of riding, then I think I'm really in a bad mood:D
Now I have come across an older man at the platform who asked me why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; these are supposed to be unflatable. Of course, that all sounds very tempting.
But are these really unrepairable? I have little interest in spending 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed later.
Furthermore, I ask myself: I believe I am currently riding a 25x622 tire on my racing bike, which is also available (apparently) at Marathon Plus tires, but most of them are already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you generally recommend tires for a racing bike?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute favorite! Do you rather recommend the Durano DD? Thank you in advance for the help and lovely greetings!
Car crashes into tree: Driver fatally injured The 53-year-old was driving on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an unknown reason and collided with a central island. He then drove onto the opposite lane, as the police reported.

Hello everyone,  finally we can announce that we will also host the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, due to known reasons, it is not possible to have more than four people in the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement. BUT: At least three people will be present per switch, so we will broadcast the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you will follow us!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will be around 0:30 when it happens. Prepare your drinks in advance, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
