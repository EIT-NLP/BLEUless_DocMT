Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

ASSISTANT: Gabba的双重电力故障解释和为什么可能再次发生的风险 Gabba的广播训练场设置中的电力故障风险不太可能在下一个澳大利亚锦标赛之前得到改善，因为板球权威机构正在等待有关训练场大规模升级以举办2032年奥林匹克运动会的更多详细信息。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

ASSISTANT: 来源告诉《墨尔本先驱报》和《悉尼先驱报》，戴维斯公园是澳大利亚板球比赛中唯一的主要球场，其球场的主要电力供应不足以为世界各地广播车辆和设备提供电力。在第四天比赛期间，主要和备用发电机提供的全球广播的电力出现了约25分钟的中断。

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 因為當地的基本電力需要供應加巴球場的燈塔 - 其中一個在2019年的Big Bash League比賽中聲名狼藉的燈塔 - 以及球場本身。因此，廣播人員的主要電力來源是為測試賽事聘請的巨型柴油發動機，輸出電力供應電視轉換，輸出電力供應電視轉換，輸出電力供應電視轉換，輸出電力供應電視轉換，輸出電力供應電視轉換，輸出

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.

ASSISTANT: 然而，在比赛的第四天，主发电机故障与备用发电机同时失效，导致广播图像和DRS的完全或部分丢失，持续了近30分钟。NEP公司，为Fox和Seven提供外部播出车和其他设施，已向提供发电机的公司寻求解释。

All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months. France is seeking 81 more approvals to reach 104 licenses needed for its boats to operate in British and Channel Island waters under the Brexit agreement signed last year.

Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.
