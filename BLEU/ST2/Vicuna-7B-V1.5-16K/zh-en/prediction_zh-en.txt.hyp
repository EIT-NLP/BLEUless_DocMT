I think it's a very meaningful certificate - a first aid certificate is one of the skills certificates that I think are important besides my driver's license!
Popularize this: Emergency measures are actually emergency rescue measures to be taken when sudden incidents occur, that is, pre-hospital care before the ambulance arrives. As everyone knows, there is still a period of time after the ambulance arrives in the event of an accident, and it is precisely this period of time that is the most critical.
At this point, it is a matter of emergency. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, our window of opportunity for saving our lives is only four minutes and 20 seconds, the golden four minutes!
So how important it is to know first aid near you! When someone collapses near us, we can use our professional knowledge to perform CPR and save their life instead of standing there helplessly and doing nothing, which is a terrifying feeling.
In China, our official data shows that there are 300,000 annual deaths due to accidents, with the most dangerous being sudden cardiac arrest. In the United States, the survival rate is only about 15% nationwide.
In the casino hotel in Las Vegas, 70% can be saved. In Shanghai and Beijing, it is below 1%. This is what the first respondent, Lu Le, said.
If a person experiences sudden cardiac arrest, with no breathing and no pulse, performing CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) on the person is of no use. It is necessary to perform artificial respiration and chest compressions to potentially save the person's life.
I have found that there are few people who have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation arises, they are unable to do anything. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in the event of an emergency. Who knows, it may even save a life!
Emergency first aid certification can be registered at your local Red Cross training center, I registered at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are also student discounts. PS: The last picture is a record of the goals I want to achieve before I turn 25, and adding the emergency first aid certification to the goal list is something I did a few months ago, but I have actually completed it!
After that, I plan to take the other certifications I want to take, and I want to take a diving certification. I saw on Little Red Book that there is also a diving emergency certification, and it seems that you need an emergency certification to take this certification, so an emergency certification is still very useful!

The Chongqing Municipal Vocational School is piloting the modern apprenticeship system. Upon enrollment, students become trainee employees of the pilot enterprises. Yesterday, reporters learned from the Municipal Education Committee that this year, the city will start the pilot of "modern apprenticeship" talent training mode in 60 vocational schools, and students who are admitted will be pre-recruited as employees by the pilot enterprises.
The municipal education bureau requires that the admission and employment of vocational school students and the use of engineering technology by enterprises be standardized, and clearly define the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise trainees. According to the principle of reciprocal selection, vocational school students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For students who have turned 16 but have not yet turned 18, agreements must be signed by the students, their guardians, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement should determine the rights and interests of each party and specify the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits guaranteed for the trainees during their on-the-job training. It is encouraged for pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-based cooperative education with enterprises to conduct pre-employment training and on-the-job training transfer.
Pilot schools need to reform their talent training mode. The school and enterprise should jointly design talent training plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise teacher standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
Pilot the training system to cultivate professional talents as a pilot period, and determine the internship time for students in accordance with the professional talent training plan during their internship in enterprises. Generally, the top internship is 6 months. In enterprise practice, implement an enterprise-based team management mode, and according to the characteristics of different professions, a teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city has determined 60 municipal-level modern vocational apprenticeship pilot programs in three batches, with each pilot program enrolling around 50 people, and a total of about 3,000 students (apprentices) trained. Following the principle of starting from the pilot and gradually expanding it to the whole city, we explore the establishment of a long-term mechanism for school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and integration of talents, in order to effectively improve the skills of students and increase their employment rate and job quality.

The China Children's Center will hold a series of activities to let children "go high-tech" during the "Sixth of June" - Xinhua Net, Beijing, May 20th, 2023.

South African doctor: Although the Omicron variant has a strong spreading ability, many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant. Although the spreading speed is faster.
According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province have formed a doctor organization and reported that the symptoms of COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The organization's president, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them need to be hospitalized.
Pili said: "They can control their illness at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said that this includes elderly patients and those with underlying health issues, who are more prone to contracting severe COVID-19 due to their underlying health conditions.
He said, compared to the previous wave of the Delta COVID-19 outbreak, in the treatment of new coronavirus patients, "they had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days."
Within two weeks of the first report of the Omicron variant in southern Africa, other doctors have also shared similar experiences. Although collecting sufficient data still requires several weeks, the observations and early evidence provided by doctors offer some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized in the past few weeks, only 30% have severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the epidemic. The average length of hospital stay has been reduced from 8 days to 2.8 days. Only 3% of recent COVID-19 patients have died, while the death rate in the early outbreak of the disease in South Africa was 20%. The Director of the Africa Health Research Institute, William Hanekom, cited data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all indicators suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said, "It's still early. We need to obtain post-epidemic data. Usually, hospitalization and death occur later, and we only entered this wave of the epidemic two weeks ago."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatments. Although Delta is still the main variant of COVID-19 globally, Omicron cases are appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa serving as the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to the health officer, in the first week of December, the number of new cases discovered in Hubei Province increased by 400%, and tests showed that over 90% of the cases were caused by the Omicron variant.

Yang Hao Dong was speaking at Mashan Mountain about the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the provincial party congress, drawing inspiration from the century-long struggle of the Party.
According to a report from Hunan Daily on December 10th (reporter Gan Paiwei), according to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on December 10th morning, provincial committee standing committee member and propaganda department minister Yang Hongdong gave a interactive lecture at the video creative park in Mashan, deeply studying and implementing the spirit of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, implementing the spirit of General Secretary Xi Jinping's important speeches and important directives on Hunan, and implementing the spirit of the 12th provincial party congress. Yang Hongdong expounded on the core meaning and practical requirements of the spirit of the conference from the three aspects of ideal belief, self-revolution, and youth of the party, combined with his personal feelings and experiences, in a comprehensive and systematic way.
He pointed out that it is important to combine the spirit of the important speeches and directives of General Secretary Xi Jinping with the spirit of the provincial party congress, and to integrate the learning and communication of the two, in order to enhance the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of "two establishes" and "two maintains" thinking, and to unswervingly move forward along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping. During the interaction and exchange section, grassroots party branch representatives, business representatives, and youth representatives asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishes", how cultural enterprises should seize the direction, and how new young people can draw strength from the hundred-year party history. Yang Haidong answered each question with simple language and vivid examples, urging young party members to draw strength from the Party's century-long struggle and to tighten their bonds with the central Party, to unswervingly follow the Party, and to use their youth to write responsibility and shoulder the burden.
According to a report from the New China News Agency on December 11, 2022, the number of graduates from universities in Beijing in 2022 is expected to reach 268,000, an increase of 16,000 compared to the previous year. The information was obtained from a joint video conference on the employment and entrepreneurship of university graduates held recently by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau.
Officials from the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau have stated that they will deploy job placement work for university graduates from Beijing universities in areas such as enhancing supply and demand matching, strengthening policy support, expanding job channels, ensuring difficult aid and support, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving service efficiency. Reporters have learned that the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will establish a practical platform, increase the number of job positions, actively contact 40 university graduate career experience bases, visit user units, and integrate demand and position information. They will focus on the "six-in-one" plan, that is, expanding the recruitment of civil service units, expanding the recruitment of state-owned enterprises, expanding the recruitment of grassroots projects, expanding the recruitment of military service, expanding the recruitment of internships and job training, and expanding the recruitment of entrepreneurship-driven job creation. They will implement dynamic management with "one life, one policy," and recommend at least 5 job position information for each graduate, ensuring

Yes, he has changed his rider and has been waiting for a long time.
That restaurant has always been saying that they are processing the order and waiting for a few hours.
I have already taken pictures and uploaded them for you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.

Hello, the chicken you ordered from the restaurant is fresh.
I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a coach who is roughly the same price as a beginner. It's not unfriendly, in fact, the price often correlates with the level of friendliness, if you can't tell the difference, then a high-priced coach may be more friendly than a cheap one, but this type of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control. The logic and hidden agenda behind their existence is - tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll give you a cheap, messy product that you'll play with twice and never play again. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel sorry for it.
Wait until you can truly distinguish good from bad, which indicates that you have made progress. When the time comes, come back here to buy expensive ones, and I will earn two times the money. I suggest spending a similar amount of money and buying a second-hand one that is slightly better, such as a Prince or Ding Luopu brand. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets are also sold at a lower price. A new racket of 500-600 yuan is good enough, while a second-hand one costs only 200 yuan. Don't you think it's enjoyable to have a racket worth thousands of yuan?
To newcomers, I am friendly, but once the newcomer stage is over, I become arrogant. However, most people, especially women, cannot pass the newcomer stage.
Can you help me follow up on the order that has been delayed multiple times for delivery?
Delayed gratitude.
That's to say, in fact, I already have credit?
Can I place a new order now? Do I need to ignore the previous order?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but when it arrived, it was missing a lot of ingredients and the chicken was raw.
#PRS\_ORG# There is no reason for you to say that I should take the blame on my own. Please cancel the order for delivery, as there is no need for me to take the blame this time.
According to a report from the reporter Chen Yuanshan of the Xinhua News Agency, the Jiangxi Province plans to train 10,000 rural elementary school teachers in music, art, and sports within the next three years to strengthen the teacher team and promote balanced development of rural compulsory education. Starting from 2016, Jiangxi Province will allocate three years to train one music, art, and sports teacher for each rural elementary school (village and below) in the province, totaling 10,000 teachers.
Based on understanding, the training objects are primary school teachers in rural areas in Jiangxi who have music, art, or physical education knowledge or talent, and can teach other subjects besides music, art, and physical education. Through the training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music, art, and physical education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of multi-skilled music, art, and physical education teachers to alleviate the problem of the shortage of rural music, art, and physical education teachers.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi has planned to send one music, art, and sports trainer to each of the 100 counties (cities, districts) in the province, with a total of 300 trainers, in order to comprehensively enhance their teaching demonstration leading capabilities, teaching research activity design and organization capabilities, teaching and training capabilities, and network online workshop construction capabilities, and play the roles of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.

I don't want the food I made 1 hour ago.
I found the buyer for the previous incorrect order, but my car wheel is missing.
Hello, how long will it take for the ordered food to be delivered?
Your delivery rider's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
Please give me a reasonable explanation, but your rider has some problems, please handle it well.
Can you check if they are still on the way? If they are, it's best to send them. If they're not, return the deposit for the reservation.
In fact, there are many discussions about the clothing and accessory matching for girls with a slim body. For girls with a pear-shaped body, the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the fat on your legs. If it is too long, it will give people the impression of being short and fat.
If you wear clothes that are divided into upper and lower sections, you will naturally appear taller. Using different colors for your top, skirt, and long socks can create a sense of length. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a popular choice for pear-shaped women (the author has a deep understanding of this point), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Elegant black short skirts are the first choice for pear-shaped women.
Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a short skirt, will make you look thinner. If you have fat legs, don't draw attention to them by wearing shoes and socks that are too noticeable.
The more popular it is, the better. The color should not be too bright. This is to avoid people paying too much attention to your legs and feet, giving the impression of being fat.
For girls who are slightly overweight, it is important to learn the rules of proper clothing and accessory matching. Do not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and do not wear tops that are too short or stuffed into the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black tights or patterned socks (the kind with fine grids, please). Choose a soft, floral print dress that falls below the knee, and pair it with a cardigan-style top that can effectively cover the flaws of a slightly overweight girl.
Of course, it's also important for thin girls to wear short skirts. When a fat girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which will enhance the effect of making her look taller.
Short skirts paired with high-heeled shoes can make your legs look longer, which is the most IN summer combination! If you are an MM with a pear-shaped body, I recommend choosing a stylish and elegant short skirt.
Not only can it cover your belly fat, but it can also showcase your advantages. A short A-shaped skirt will look very slimming, which is more suitable for overweight girls. When choosing a top, choose something that is tight-fitting to create a layering effect, which will make you look even slimmer.
Simply put, a white T-shirt can be paired with a short skirt. Even pear-shaped women can try it out. Thin girls can also create a fashionable look.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and styling, even skinny girls will be the focus of everyone's attention. After making changes in dressing and styling, it's also important to exercise more in life and try to leave the label of "skinny girl" behind as early as possible😄

Performance is stable, and the four exhaust vents can dissipate heat without any problems. This gamepad is definitely worth recommending. It's well-made and the materials used are of good quality, so you can trust the brand!
The price of the Huawei Mate 40 Pro is not considered expensive. Personally, I think the Huawei Mate 40 Pro's dark shadow rider dragon is really good. Game effect: The game effect is smooth and can be played comfortably with most games. My chicken eating is all high frame rate stable, very smooth, and LOL is not affected at all. CSGO is also easily won, and most three-A games can be played.

Appearance material: The appearance is very cool and eye-catching, and the game's display effect is also very good. The screen is clear and playing games at 1080p is sufficient.
It's great to buy a notebook, which is really not bad at all. It's mainly used for design, and the price-performance ratio is very high. It's lighter than I imagined and more attractive than I expected. The red on my butt is the color of a very good-looking wine, not too flashy, and overall it exceeds my expectations by a lot. It's a very good purchase, and it's suitable for girls too. Two years ago, I started to get in touch with Huawei Night Rider, and I've been using it for two years. The price-performance ratio is quite high, and the quality is very durable!
Friends around me have all recommended that they buy this product! So far, I have bought three machines in this series!
The appearance is beautiful and eye-catching, and the configuration is also very suitable for giving to the nephew. Originally, I planned to wait for the 418 banking event, but he urgently needed it, so I bought it early and missed the banking big event. There is a little regret.
Although it has a high price-performance ratio, the logistics is also quite fast. Let's take a closer look at the full review of the new original game notebook with a high price-performance ratio. The design style is quite good, and it has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.

Is there only one order for shrimp dumplings? Why do you have six copies?
I will not go, I am following the delivery order.
This past hour, no one has contacted me. This is definitely not my first time ordering takeout online, so don't think it's a scam.
After the investigation, you'll say something like this: "I checked the address several times before placing the order, and it turned out to be a good one. Thank you!" How many days is it?
From 7:00 am to now 9:30 am, none of them have been sent, you must return the deposit and cancel the order.
The title of the new district is the "Super Runner with the Loudest Exhaust Sound!" This time, our team brings you a car that is many men's dreams!
It's the flagship super sports car of Lamborghini, the successor to Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4! With a price tag of nearly two hundred million yuan and annual road tax of tens of thousands, it is four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
Because it has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? I don't know either, according to the data, it only takes 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100km/h. That's right, by the time your myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h. Hmm.
The low-slung body, the flamboyant scissor doors, the massive air intakes all around the car, and the glass that provides an unobstructed view of the 6.5-liter V12 engine perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini. There's no need to go into too much detail about the car's description, as you can easily find it on Google. I've compiled some explanations that Google may not have provided!
Too eye-catching, everyone is looking at it wherever it goes. I feel quite uncomfortable! (Actually, it's quite refreshing) The price of 1km fuel is around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
It's important to practice getting in and out of the car, otherwise it can be a bit embarrassing (because you might not be able to climb out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is quite loud, and you may suddenly become deaf after getting out of the car. (But it's still quite enjoyable)
The car is too big to stop at a regular parking spot. It's too narrow and I'm afraid that when the car next to me opens their door, it will hit mine! It's a bit lonely because there's no competition on the road (I'm just kidding, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Everyone, please don't misunderstand, the super-pacing of this video is not for sale. I'm sorry! If you want to shoot a video for your car, please feel free to contact us!
For more car news that you may not know, check out The Car Guide / People's Car Chronicle, which is involved in accidents worth millions of dollars!
The Bugatti Chiron and the Porsche 911 are both well-known to car enthusiasts. The Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the Porsche 911's car price is also in the million-dollar range! Recently, a Porsche 911 and a Bugatti Chiron were both wrecked in a short span of just a few minutes!
By looking at the results, it's clear that you are right!

According to a special report from the Xinhua News Agency on May 19th, the maximum length of the suspension of studies for college students in Guangxi for entrepreneurship has been extended to 5 years. The reporter recently learned from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region that starting from next semester, all universities in Guangxi will implement flexible academic systems, allowing college students to extend their suspension of studies for entrepreneurship by 2 to 5 years, and the time spent on entrepreneurship during their studies can be regarded as practical education time.
In order to enhance the entrepreneurship and innovation capabilities of university students, the departments of education and social affairs in Guangxi have joined forces to build an entrepreneurship platform. They are constructing more off-campus practical teaching and learning bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external support for entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of each university's innovation and entrepreneurship practice base for undergraduate students should reach 3,000 square meters or more, and the area of vocational schools should reach 2,000 square meters or more.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship education departments and prioritizes supporting outstanding students who transition to specialized fields in innovation and entrepreneurship practice. University teachers are required to spend at least two months on-the-job training at industrial enterprises every two years to enhance their awareness and capabilities in innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The education bureau of the autonomous region requires all universities in Guizhou to deeply implement the plan for training college students in innovation and entrepreneurship, and strive to ensure that every college student participates in an innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their schooling. Universities should actively organize students to participate in various levels of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.

Visual wedding photography base (Hebei store) currently does not have a branch of avant-garde wedding dresses, makeup artists are also top-notch, shooting techniques and angles are called professional, and the shooting effect is very good.
The seller has a very good reputation, and the service is also very good. The makeup is very delicate, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very enjoyable, and the professional team provided very good service. The seller's service attitude was very good, and I will definitely introduce them to my friends and be very satisfied.
Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, I now have a one-of-a-kind wedding photo. Thank you to all the staff who worked on the wedding photo today, I look forward to the release of the final product.
Shooting wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for the photographer who is constantly running and jumping. The makeup artist was very considerate and helped me design a makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer was humorous and lively during the shoot, making it worth praising.
Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist, I am grateful to be able to see myself as beautiful in this lifetime. Praise the women, their eyes are beautiful, their figures are tall and healthy, just looking at them is enough to be a virtuous wife and a good mother in the future.
The groom has earned enough, a lifetime of happiness, and beauty. The quality of the wedding photos is really good, just like what is said online, we and our beloved look very handsome and beautiful in the photos, we are very satisfied.

The wedding photo is too good-looking, the photographer and makeup artist are really super professional. Thank you Mu-shi for patiently accompanying and attentively instructing. The photos turned out great!
When I saw the wedding dress photos, I suddenly couldn't recognize myself. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have wedding dress photos that are as good as those of celebrities.
Taking wedding photos is more important than just the photographer and makeup artist being aesthetically pleasing. Fortunately, I met someone who was online. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I had also been "deceived" by them.
An Asian-American group filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.
The Asian American Education League, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the lawsuit. The president of the organization, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission criteria of top US universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three top US universities has basically remained the same.
Many studies indicate that in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process of these universities, "long-term continuous and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" occurs. Zhao Yuchun introduced that in the three universities studied by Sanders et al. in 2014, the acceptance rate for Asian applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Davidson College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhou Yuxuan told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to launch investigations and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions.
They also hope that being sued by universities can actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies for Asians. Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded.
The Alliance for Asian American Education was established in 2015. At that time, they had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to Chinese-American organizations, other organizations such as Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups have also participated in the lawsuit.

In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province, from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Ms. Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a down payment through a bank transfer on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Warehouse Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the payee, and it was clearly stated that "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory warehouse, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not agree to sell this factory warehouse, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agreed to sign the factory warehouse purchase and sale contract within one week." However, due to differences in the scope of the factory warehouse sale and the payment method, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main contract terms, resulting in the delay of the signing of the factory warehouse purchase and sale contract.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin decided to refund the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After finally finding a house that he liked, he paid the deposit and was ready to pay the remaining amount, but the seller refused to sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court. The court after hearing finds that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not required to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract and returning double the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff filed an appeal. Recently, the second-instance court upheld the original judgment.
Lawyer's Reminder: Be cautious and exercise due diligence in the trading process. As the buyer, you should exercise caution and due diligence when signing a contract, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm just afraid he sent the wrong address.
Restaurant Jiangchang (Wudu Branch) [Peach Blossom] Environment: Medium-sized [Service Bell] Service: Very quick "Ancient Methods Malacca Cake" is my must-try dish. The cake is so fragrant and soft, it's delicious! If you like desserts, you definitely have to try "Dongjiang Ink Fish Slippery Fermented Tofu Pot". The soup is very fresh, the tofu is very tender, and the ink...
Flavor praise, meat dishes are good, service with enthusiasm, it's been a long time since I came to Rongcheng, and the fruit drinks are still as good as before. The real materials are authentic, and the first time I tried the charcoal-grilled buns, it was the southern soft taste that I loved!
The claypot rice is at the right level of dryness and the portion is very generous. The signature Sichuan chicken wings are as good as ever, and the example soup is also not bad. The processing of the asparagus is also quite...tasty. The flavor is praised, the service is enthusiastic, and the meat dishes are delicious.
Jī chāng lǎo diàn, hěn duō nián nián yě shì wǎng hóng de cún xì tā de, dōng dān xiǎo lóu, mù dì tī. mén kuò yào yào wài hěn hěn kuò qù de zhēng zhī fàn, zhēng zhī fàn de shēn gē dà kāi le...
For several years, I haven't eaten at Restaurant Jiangchang, and the rise of various small shops offering Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the customer flow. It's hard to find a seat when you go there, and the quality of the dishes hasn't declined at all, just like in the past.
The flavor is praised, meat dishes are good, and the main course is praised at Zhongshan Outside Delivery.
Meal: The menu this time is slightly disappointing. Three bowls of chicken: the side dishes are a bit too much, and the chicken meat is slightly lacking.
The aftertaste is a bit off, the saltiness of the base flavor is not strong enough, which highlights the sweetness. Everyone can fill in the sweetness plus various spices and herbs.
What is the correct way to drink Red Label whisky? Everyone has different preferences, some people like to collect, some people like to eat delicious food, of course, there are also people who like to taste wine, Red Label whisky is one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at the International Wine Competition.
Each bottle of red label whiskey has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to appreciate it, isn't it a waste of its fragrant aroma? How should red label whiskey be drunk then?
Here is the translation of the text from Chinese to English:  小编为大家简单介绍下。红牌威士忌喝法：
Johnny Walker Red Label whisky is made up of about 35 types of Scottish whisky and has a strong and fragrant aroma with the characteristics of traditional Scottish whisky. The aroma is rich in sweetness and smoky flavor. The taste is strong and refreshing, with a hint of mint and a strong smoky flavor of roasted barley.
This whiskey can be drunk directly with ice or mixed with one's favorite beverage. Red Label whiskey has been introduced to China, and to suit the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label whiskey mixed with Coca-Cola or Sprite or other carbonated beverages has become a fashionable and long-lasting drink.
These sweet drinks can not only balance the sour taste, but also bring visual pleasure and enhance the flavor when added to the drink. They can also act as a mixer to change the taste and mouthfeel of the drink. The classic and traditional way to drink whiskey is to mix it with a slice of lemon, a cube of sugar (sand sugar can also be used), and a splash of water.
The flavor of genuine red label whisky is slightly acidic, and adding sugar can neutralize its acidity. Lemon can bring a refreshing citrus aroma to the whisky, of course, the sweet-sour balance can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. Above three ways are the best way to drink red label whisky, and everyone can try them as a reference, hoping that the introduction can help everyone.

Golden Lady Wedding Photography (South Street Store) temporarily does not have a branch for taking photos. Before the photo shoot, we did not arrange the time properly and had to change the time twice. Our consultant, Lan Lan, was very patient and helped us arrange the time for us.
Later, I chose a weekend to shoot. The staff of Jin Furen, including consultants, makeup artists, and photographers, were all praised.
That was my first time formally doing makeup, wow~ I can't believe it. One day, I'll look that good too, haha. Jiaqi and another sister (sorry, I don't remember her name) did my makeup very patiently and naturally.
The scenery was filmed in Wuxi City, and fortunately, the weather was good that day, so I didn't feel too cold. During the photo shoot, the makeup artist occasionally paid attention to our clothes and accessories and quickly arranged them if they looked a little messy. The photographer was also very funny and made us feel happy after a whole day of shooting.
When choosing photos, we didn't want to let the guests delete too many photos, but when we were choosing the photos, we didn't have the intention to add any extra photos. We just chose the 24 photos in the package, and none of them were added. I heard that my cousin who took my wedding dress photos charged over 7,000 yuan for a package that included over 10,000 photos. I was shocked at the time, and I was also afraid that I would choose too many photos. The photos have been edited now, and Lan Lan has sent them to me. I looked at them and found two that I didn't like. They immediately helped me re-edit them.
Compare the photos that my little sister took before, and I think our photos are really satisfactory. They are simple and fresh, just the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to take their wedding dress photos at Xinhua Jinwifei!
Package price: 3999 yuan. To my dear wife, I sincerely wish you all the happiness and blessings in the world. May your future be as bright as the finest silk!

You are called Zhang Ming, and this is your second week in Japan. You are walking on the street when suddenly you feel someone following you. You are afraid and start to run faster and faster until you finally run away.
The person behind you is calling: "Miss! Please wait!" (Full Japanese dialogue) You have stopped at the door of the convenience store. "Miss... I am a director. You look very beautiful. Are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are doubtful and afraid that this is a scam. He gives you a business card, and you discover that he is the director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The fee will definitely not be high.  You hesitated for a moment and then followed him to the company. He said he had seen you on the street and was very eager for you to join.
You signed the contract thinking there would be no loss and you could still make money. This is a large-scale reality dating show split into two parts.
In the early stage, the celebrities and amateurs will interact in real life to develop chemistry. Later on, they will enter the game together to overcome challenges.

In Sabah, 320 newborn babies have not received birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the disruption of special anti-forgery paper supply. The Sabah National Registration Office said that since the stock of special anti-forgery paper ran out in early October, they have not been able to issue birth certificates to newborn babies, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200 so far.
However, the head of the bureau, Keqiuran, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have had their materials recorded in the system. They will be issued once the anti-forgery certificates arrive next week. He made an explanation at a press conference regarding a report by a net media that the issue of forged birth certificates in Sabah has lasted for 10 months.
He said that the problem appeared two months ago, and so did Sri Lanka. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory that produces special anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used in Sabah is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states. KRUAMINUS revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and will be handed over to the printing company on the 8th for partial printing work.
The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Wednesday to purchase goods, and they will immediately proceed to the final stage of printing upon their return to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take about two working days (December 20th) to deliver to the applicant.  "We will inform the applicants to go to each branch office to pick up the report form."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 birth certificates so far this year.
Isn't it already past 7:00?  (Note: "从 7 点多等到现在" means "from 7:00 plus some time until now," and "快到了" means "it's about time" or "it's almost there.")

This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the proportion of students admitted to special classes, and the competition for admission to these classes has become more intense. For example, in Dongcheng District, the proportion of primary school students admitted to special classes this year is less than 5% of the total planned enrollment for the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 students. The admission rate is also less than 10% of the school's planned enrollment.
All students who have sports, art, or technology specialties and have registered online are eligible to participate in the specialty enrollment examination. In order to facilitate students' participation in the examination, the examination arrangement method adopted by Dongcheng District last year will be continued, with 1-2 examination points set up in each school district, totaling 13 examination points.
The examination points will be divided into examination zones, and the examination time will be divided into time periods. On the day of the examination, students will enter the examination points in different examination zones and take the examination according to the time periods. On May 23rd, the list of students who have passed the examination will be announced on the website of the district education admission examination center, and students can query the examination results online.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: Firmly believes that China has the ability to successfully host the Winter Olympics during a special period - Xinhua Net, Sarajevo, December 11, 2021. The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, recently expressed that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to successfully host the Winter Olympics during a special period.
Recently, the Chinese Ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesic, at the Sarajevo Olympic Center. During the meeting, Kvesic positively evaluated the China-Bosnia relations and expressed that he had a deep impression of China's excellent organizational work during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and firmly believed that China has the ability to hold a successful Winter Olympics in a special period. The Bosnian side is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing the event. They hope to use this opportunity to expand exchanges and cooperation in the sports field with China.
Qi Ping indicated that there is a special "Olympic belt" between the two countries. The Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here in 1984, and two months later, the Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains and present a simple, safe, and spectacular event to the world.
The Chinese embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to deepen cooperation with Bosnia and Herzegovina in the preparation and training of athletes for winter sports events, and to promote cultural exchanges between the two countries. The embassy also wishes to use the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote people-to-people exchanges between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to wish the athletes from Bosnia and Herzegovina good luck in the competition. The Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee recently held the "10th Annual Best Athlete" award ceremony, and Qu Yi, a special invited guest, presented the award to the best young athlete from Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video for the Beijing Winter Olympics is being played in a loop at the event venue.

The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work in border cities. The notice requires that people who leave land border cities (excluding those with a border with Hong Kong and Macao) within the next 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test result within the past 48 hours. After arriving at the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city range in each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, port cities may conduct research on setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent exchange between the two sides of the border. Implementing differentiated management policies based on regional differences can turn a single control line into two control lines, which may achieve the goal of moving the front line of the epidemic and reducing the risk of epidemic spreading, with the aim of achieving the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and cost.
Recently, there have been multiple local outbreaks of the epidemic in our country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemic areas through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as delayed and inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formalism in regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of cold chain materials in various segments, inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic emergency.
Notice Requesting Efforts to Strengthen Epidemic Prevention and Control Mechanisms in Port Cities, Improve Infectious Disease Monitoring and Early Warning Systems, and Implement Border Control Measures from Nine Perspectives, with a Focus on Filling Gaps in Epidemic Prevention and Control in Port Cities, Ensuring that No Effort is Spared and Work is Done Scientifically and Accurately, and Strengthening the Front Line of Epidemic Prevention and Control. The notice emphasizes that port cities should synchronize epidemic prevention and control with public welfare guarantees, publish hotlines for public welfare guarantees, regularly check and resolve hidden dangers in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices, and promptly respond to and proactively address prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the cities referred to include the open land, water, and air ports, as well as the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (autonomous regions, states, leagues) where they are located, and the directly-administered cities. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) based on epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

Oil pipeline video exposes US military's 20-year bloodthirsty killing spree - Xinhua Net (video source: oil pipeline)
On February 11th, a documentary titled "Murder Machine" caused widespread attention on an oil pipeline platform. The film tells the story of the United States using the pretext of "anti-terrorism" to launch a war in Afghanistan, forcibly exporting American-style democracy, resulting in 20 years of brutal, bloodthirsty, and murderous behavior, committing countless crimes against humanity.
Misusing drones to attack hospitals, schools, and other civilian sites, twisting human nature and forming a murderous group. Over the past 20 years, the US military has killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has established "black sites" where they subject "criminals" to various forms of torture and humiliation. This has sparked more hatred among Afghans for these heinous crimes.
As the video says, the "anti-terrorism" war in the United States "becomes more and more terrifying." The war has not brought peace, democracy, and prosperity to the Afghan people, but has only brought devastation and countless killings.
Let's watch the video together and unveil the truth behind America's "anti-terrorism" bloodbath, piercing through the hypocrisy and false facade of American democracy!
The delivery was late, the food was cold, and after it cooled down, it became hard and brittle, making it impossible to eat. The soup also spilled out.
Immediately cancel it. The things sent by #PRS\_ORG# must have all cooled down. I haven't even taken them yet!
#NAME# says nobody has been calling us lately.
If you don't return the money, I will report to the police.
Several times using #PRS\_ORG#, today's experience is the worst and completely unacceptable.
Sure, I can do that. Here's the translation:  "Good, I can do it, but please also remind the restaurant and the driver."
Avoid it from happening again next time.
I want to know the exact delivery time, but it keeps being delayed.
I don't know when to cancel the order, can I refund the deposit?
How do I pay the service fee to the rider?
One hour ago, it was confirmed that a rider was unwilling to wait any longer.
Don't scare people into buying books at the starting line - when browsing on Xinhua Book City's website, you can often feel the heat of successful self-help books.
The successful books today often tout "the best principles" - that is, they assume or imply that you can "do it" and then tell you what you need to do to achieve it. In essence, they skip over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it."
Because of this, these books all have a common characteristic - either they are done to the best of their ability, or they are not done at all; either they are 100%, or they are 0%; either you climb to the top of the mountain, or you stay put in the same place. This "best principle" is so correct that anyone who sees it will acknowledge its validity, but 99% of people will be intimidated at the starting line.
Because this theory encourages a path of "you must suffer and make a 180-degree transformation," which is a fatal weakness for many people. For those who are rigidly adhering to the rules, sticking to the old ways, and resisting change, shouting "you must transform" in their ears is undoubtedly self-deception and fooling others.
The vast majority of people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate, unable to take the first step forward. Alternatively, they may make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and boldly take the first step, but it is often short-lived, and they give up within a short period of time, making it difficult to see the continuity. Master Ma's famous joke "From Tomorrow" vividly portrays this "universal human nature".
The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making most people feel overwhelmed and give up. Perhaps "the second best principle" could be a way for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
The core of the "Second Principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "gathering small victories," that is, if you can't do 100, it's okay to do just 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb the small sand hill in front of your door, because that's also stronger than just standing still. In summary, as long as you've done something, it's always stronger than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction of barriers, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere and achieve success. As long as one is persistent, the chance of success will also increase. However, following the "second-rate principle" to achieve success, the path may be slightly longer.
In summary, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone's success, but in reality, it only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" is more effective in motivating a larger number of people and maximizing their benefits.
Now, do I need to re-place an order?
The phone keeps ringing without anyone answering.
Have you not received it yet? When will it be delivered?
How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two meals, but there is an order that has been completed. I would like to ask how to contact the rider.
The first rider just told me that there will be another rider who will send someone.
According to a report from the reporters Li Xiaofeng and Zhang Hongxiao of the Xinhua News Agency, the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is an increase of 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
Qinghai Lake carp is a local name for the fish, and it is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake watershed. In the 1960s and 1970s, the fish was severely depleted due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and other human factors. By 2002, the resource stock of Qinghai Lake carp had decreased to only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the Chinese red list of endangered species listed the naked carp from Qinghai Lake as an endangered species. Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake and prohibited any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of the lake. It is also prohibited to sell naked carp and their products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and stocking, as well as the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientifically reasonable "passageways" for fish, the protection measures have been continuously strengthened. As a result, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's grass carp has increased year by year. Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 million grass carp have been artificially bred and stocked, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake's grass carp resources.
The Qinghai Three Rivers Source Region is a crucial ecological barrier and water-sustaining area not only in China but also in Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural ecological barrier and functional area that controls the expansion of the western desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment and water-sustaining wildlife in the Three Rivers Source Region and the water body of Qinghai Lake, as well as maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment has issued emergency bans on fishing in key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system under the slogan "One River, One River, One Lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, which needs to be filled up and the weather is cold.
Can you ask me about whether takeout is packed in a bag? We only see one bag.
"Want to know if it was accidentally sent or if someone took it, thanks."
It has been an hour and I still haven't sent it.
Today is the Lunar New Year, and ordering too much food to be disappointed and have to make reservations for the kids to eat elsewhere.
I hope even in the busiest store, there will be a check on the products.
Is it a sign of a loose electrical connection if your feet feel numb after a bath? Choosing the right type of bathtub can provide excellent therapeutic benefits for your feet. Today, our US team will provide an answer to this question and hope it will be helpful to our friends.
With the strengthening of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety hazards.
"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!" Mr. Li told the reporters. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation in his soles.
At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was amazed to discover that the water in the bathtub was electrified.
Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they refused to return the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable. This is because he found that the popular bathtub that has been around for a long time does not have any clear and detailed industry regulations on issues such as the maximum temperature setting, the intended user group, and the materials used to ensure safety.
However, in general, bathtubs do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled bathtub.
Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards. At the same time, you can freely use the pen to test.
The 13th Provincial Tea Fair Opens - Eye-catching Headlines - Hunan Daily Network - Hunan Daily Online December 10, 2022 (Full Media Reporters: Zhang Shanwu, Hu Minmin, Correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, Photography: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and the New Chahua Red Tea Promotion Conference were held at the Hunan International Convention and Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the pace towards the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
The vice chairman of the Council of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, Hu Shunli, and the vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hong, attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, renowned engineer and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Liu Zhichao, made a grand introduction: The source of Lake Honghu has been transformed in the new era, and the rise of red tea has injected new vitality into "Five-Colored Yangtze Tea".
In recent years, the provincial committee and provincial government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry and promoted the construction of the billion-yuan Sichuan tea industry, forming a development pattern of "three lakes and four rivers and five tea colors". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with green tea, black tea, and red tea as the main tea types, and the main tea-producing areas have promoted the integration of tea tourism, driving the increase in income for large tea farmers.
The feng shui changes, and the red tea gains strength. Provincial tea experts say that after picking green tea and red tea, black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the output value of tea gardens continues to rise.
At the opening ceremony, provincial leaders awarded licenses to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. Fujian tea merchants were impressed by a high-mountain tea named "Ice Spring" and immediately placed an order.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhen, said with pleasure that the current epidemic and other factors have affected the tea market to some extent, but from the scene of the tea exhibition, the highlights are abundant. A new type of red tea is bright red, infused with the cultural essence of tea, and it is popular with the public and generates a lot of trading. The tea industry in the region is looking forward to a new spring.

[Effect] Photo effect: Overall, it's not bad. I particularly like this set of pictures.  [Service] Service details: Since I was pregnant during the makeup process, it was a bit uncomfortable.

Mr. Tan is no longer needed to be introduced. Photography is a very professional field. The entire workshop has an artistic atmosphere, and there are also two cute little kittens accompanying and playing around.
We are working in Beijing, and all the good film studios in Beijing need to be queued up half a year in advance. My colleagues who have been to Beijing have said that the final product is just so. I especially sought out this studio, a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, and we think this is also a common problem for most people. The photographer uncle will take pictures and record the natural and exciting moments. Makeup artist, photographer, post-production designer, a team of excellence.

I hope this kind of studio won't be buried, and more people discover TA, and shoot their own style, rather than being formulaic. I am very grateful for the five-star reviews from Cai Xiong and Jing Ling. Both of them are very creative newcomers, and we are a creative studio. We will do our best to complete the work to the satisfaction of the client, and we are grateful for the opportunity to meet each other.
The sweet and caring assistant, as well as the lively and enthusiastic photographer teacher, are all very nice. It was an unforgettable experience and the results exceeded my expectations. Thank you all for your hard work. It was an honor to work with you. From Hohhot to Qinhuangdao, the trust you placed in us was a journey of several thousand kilometers. I am happy to have met you all and hope to have the opportunity to come back to Qinhuangdao and play again in the future.
I want to know how to give money. The delivery of the meal has already been sent.
There is no rider to receive the call from the restaurant staff right now.
A programming beginner who wants to share their personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training place, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and you need to spend 6 months to learn.
However, if you are planning to enter this industry, training is actually a very good choice, especially for those who are weak and lack self-sufficiency. Training is also a very good choice for them. If you have strong self-sufficiency, you can also choose to self-study, but it may be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is a very important thing. First, you need to look at the human resources of this institution. If the human resources are not strong enough, then this training institution has no meaning. Of course, some newly established training institutions may not have very strong human resources.
Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is recommended to inquire about the institution and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can truly know the quality of the institution and whether the course explanations are good or not. Hello, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer your question as I don't have enough information about your personal situation. The study of this subject is closely related to your personal circumstances.
For example, professional background, age, desired language, and even the city you want to study or work in will be related to the industry you want to study or work in. If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has already graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is relatively high, and the investment of time is relatively large. Generally, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.
However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online now, or you can also find training resources on B station. If you don't know where to find resources, you can contact me for free resources or detailed consultation. In addition, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive study.
If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without putting in too much effort, and the teachers' explanations are very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone to answer them. In addition, many training institutions now have employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and they will recommend you to companies after you finish your studies. This way, you can save a lot of trouble when you go for job interviews in the future.
The above are some of my thoughts. As I don't understand your situation, I only roughly introduced them and didn't go into detail. If you have any other questions or consultations, you can contact me at any time for communication and exchange.
I said 1 point before, I saw it on the App.
What do you call it when I haven't finished speaking, and you're doing something else?
The author accepts various services, including installation, cleaning, repair of water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil boilers, lighting fixtures, glass cleaning, professional tailoring, and housekeeping services. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is tiring, but we must continue to strive for it.
Life will not disappoint those who make every effort. If you like it, please pay attention to me. Thank you to those who silently gave me a thumbs up. Life is like this, others only look at the result, while we alone face the process. Besides being strong, we must continue. We have no choice but to move forward...
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful through service, and service becomes splendid through sincerity. Although cleaning may be the dirtiest job we do, we will approach every corner of the customer's home with the most meticulous attitude, and when we see the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised index finger, we know that all the fatigue is worth it, and the effort is finally rewarded!
My daily work - Your requirements, my service.
With sincere service, with sincere cleaning, keep the beauty. You care about every detail, and our wealthy housekeeping service will do everything "clean" that I can do, and serve with love for the family.
Keep every household clean and tidy, carve the family's genealogy tablet, serve with sincerity, and keep everything clean until you return home. Indoor and outdoor cleaning is my daily work.
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull and lackluster if they are not cleaned for a long time. Only by cleaning them can they shine with their full color and brilliance. In the same way, success in life requires careful attention to detail and meticulous craftsmanship. We take our work seriously and strive for excellence in everything we do.
Give me a chance, I will definitely make you satisfied, quality speaks for everything, because professionalism is worthy of trust, your recognition is my greatest encouragement! The current society is not good either!
However, I always believe that as long as one is sincere, persistent, and diligent, they will be better than others. At least, they will be better than those who just sit and complain. One day's success depends on the morning. All the good things start from the early morning. I hope you start the day with happiness, luck, health, and everything you wish for. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we possessed, and having it brought us happiness; as we grew older, happiness became a goal we sought to achieve, and achieving it brought us happiness; but as we matured, we discovered that happiness is actually a state of mind, and understanding it brought us happiness. Be true to yourself, follow your heart, and live without regrets; life is a journey, walk your own path; in life, there are two treasures: a healthy body and a good mood, live beautifully until old age!
At every stage of life, different challenges will arise. Often, what constrains you is not your ability, but your willingness to face them with courage.
Since we cannot avoid it, let's face it head-on. The more afraid you are, the more likely you will be defeated by difficulties; if you face challenges with courage, the problems will eventually be resolved.
The Chinese text reads:  中沙策展人携手举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展-新华网新华社利雅得12月12日电（记者王海洲 胡冠）沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展 — — 迪里耶当代艺术双年展，于11日在位于沙特首都利雅得西北部的迪里耶JAX艺术区正式向公众开放，共有来自沙特、中国等地的64位艺术家参展。
This year's exhibition is co-organized by the Saudi Diriyah Biennial Foundation and the UCCA Dune Art Museum in China. UCCA Dune Art Museum Director Tian Pengfei serves as the art director. According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennial is "Touching Stones Across the River," which represents the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation and reflects the current situation of Saudi cultural development.
This year's exhibition covers an area of nearly 1200 square meters, and the exhibition hall spans six interconnected buildings, presented in six units: "Touching Stones Across the River", "Inheritance as an Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among the 27 Saudi Arabian artists' works, they account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering painting, installation art, and performance art, among other forms. 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, some of whom use innovative ways to create using recycled materials. For example, Xu Bing reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials in the "Behind the Story Series - The Endless Mountains of the Stream" (2014).
According to the Chief Executive Officer of the Diraiye Foundation, Barkley, he hopes that this year's exhibition can establish an international dialogue and allow global audiences to understand the vibrant cultural and creative industries and creative communities in Saudi Arabia, as well as strengthen exchanges and interactions. Tian Pengyu said: "The objective of the biennial exhibition is double-edged, not only can Saudi contemporary art participate in the global dialogue, but also allow Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to the understanding, during the two-year exhibition cycle, a series of lectures will be held, and artists, curators, and leaders of the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.

Yunnan: Comprehensively standardize and regulate the management of public welfare positions in rural areas - Xinhua Net, Yunnan Province, December 12, 2021 (Reporter Lin Bikui) In order to continuously do a good job of poverty alleviation and employment assistance, consolidate and expand poverty alleviation achievements, the Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, which will help promote the comprehensive development of rural areas.
The Yunnan Provincial Department of Ethnic and Religious Affairs introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions, which are used to place impoverished labor forces and other rural difficult-to-employ groups, and play an important role in helping impoverished populations achieve employment and income increases, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the capacity of rural public services. This new regulation was jointly issued by the Yunnan Ethnic and Religious Affairs Department, the Rural Revitalization Department, the Ministry of Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly regulates the scope of objects for recruiting rural public welfare positions, the management of funds, the development of positions, and the management of positions, etc.
In terms of job assignment, the new regulations are clear and follow the principles of "job-posting, position-based allocation, dynamic management, and quantity control," as well as "who develops, who uses, who is responsible," and "one person, one post, voluntary disclosure, unified management." The recruitment process must follow the steps of advertisement, application, review, public announcement, hiring, on-the-job training, and post-assignment arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidizing rural public welfare positions, and stipulated that the departments responsible for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase accidental injury commercial insurance for rural public welfare position appointees. It was also required that relevant departments regularly monitor the subsidy disbursement situation for rural public welfare positions.

Although right-wing forces have had periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine briefly when they get a little bit of sunlight and break out into a sweat when they drink a little bit of water. Even if they have some success, they are quickly defeated and their leaders are captured. However, when it comes to the facts, right-wing forces have played an active role in promoting social progress.
From the end of the Cultural Revolution to defining the standard of truth, promoting economic development, enhancing technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing cannot be denied. Thirdly, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems.
However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damages to the people's livelihood, and chaos in political parties. Furthermore, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation. Fourthly, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who engage in political opportunism and try to profit from the situation are not rightists, but rather a bunch of misfits.
Let's talk more about this. Left, in fact, is a group of outcasts of a generation and politics.
If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost its credibility because it only wants what the Communist Party has discarded.  Fifthly, I recently saw some friends scolding the enemy and refuting the leftists. They were quite passionate, but I think it's unnecessary.
Don't even try to reason with the Han collaborators or the leftists. It's all nonsense. There's no point in trying to prove that we are right, and we don't need the enemy and the leftists to acknowledge us. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the enemy insults you with five cents, and when the left-wing insults you as a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people also had ideals when they were young, but after they grew up, they forgot about them, or pursued them, but ended up becoming obsessive.
The ideal gradually recedes into the distance, even to the point where the young dragon becomes the evil dragon. I think the left and right are generally referring to constraints and freedom. China, due to its historical and cultural genetic predisposition, should be inherently inclined towards the left.
In China, the right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and places more emphasis on fairness and safety. Currently, society as a whole desires more emphasis on fairness, while China and the United States are in competition, and the left-wing is generally accepted, and it is expected to continue for many years to come.
Although you can't understand it, just give it a thumbs up and it's all settled. What else is there to say?
I don't want to wait until 19:06 to place an order. I've already waited for 2 hours. 😅
Today, let's take a look at some [strange search trends]. What is normal public opinion?
Translate the following text from Chinese to English:  Randomly select three hot searches: February 2nd Lunar New Year, the increase in the price of good friends, and the commodity pull-up event. The public opinion spreads out and forms a wave, then the [logarithmic decrease] (smooth curve) gradually dissipates, and if there is secondary public opinion, there will be a small wave again. They look exactly the same as the [network sentiment evolution model] displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration of China.
What is an abnormal mood? Randomly select six hot searches from the same event and present them in the form of [isolated peak], [jagged teeth], and [cliff state].
【Island Peak State】It refers to the rapid rise in temperature due to human intervention, causing a surge in hot searches and attracting public attention. 【Sawtooth State】It refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings. 【Cliff State】It refers to collective withdrawal, where the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and it is assigned a new task or moves to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave coincides with the trough of another event's heat wave, with time intervals of seconds, which must be the unified water army receiving a task and launching a new round of offensives.
The professionalism of Xiaohongguan is evident in the fact that several hot search terms are simultaneously trending, and which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for knowledge dissemination, which ones provoke conflicts, which ones shift attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, which ones manipulate decisions, which ones are divided into batches, and which ones are fine-tuned at different nodes. Almost all elements of the spread of public opinion are considered in the fine-tuning of Xiaohongguan's account. The dissemination of information is a science, and subjective factors such as personal opinions and emotions are discarded. Xiaohongguan's public relations also rely solely on objective data.
Everyone who passes by will leave a trace, such traces, let's dig them up together. Data source: Time-traveling search engine.
According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus.
Mauritius has reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. According to the Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius from South Africa on November 27th. The other infected person is a local resident who came into contact with a person who had recently traveled to South Africa and tested positive for COVID-19 on November 30th.
After isolation and treatment at the hospital, the two infected individuals had negative nucleic acid test results and have returned to their respective residences. The Cyprus Ministry of Health announced on the 10th that the country's first case of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus was confirmed.
Three of them are students, and they have just returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. They are all light cases and have not been hospitalized for treatment. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant, the Argentine government is constantly increasing the level of epidemic prevention and control measures.
From December 6th, 2022 to January 10th, 2023, passengers aged 12 and above entering China by flight will need to pay for nucleic acid testing at the airport after arrival. The State Council announced on January 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 in China against COVID-19 with Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine.
The Minister of Health of Malawi, Khumbize Chiponda, said on the 9th that the country had discovered its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus. The country's health department conducted genome sequencing on 12 new COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 19 to December 2, and found that these three cases were infected with the Omicron variant.

The text "收到是金钱肚订单是凤爪" in Chinese can be translated to English as "Receiving the order is a tiger's mouth, and the money is in the belly."
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do I need to keep it in the conversation?
I #NAME# called your staff and explained.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
The Great Wall 360 has 360 sets of furniture for families. Address: No. 156, South Ring Road, Happiness Garden, 12th Floor, Chaoyang District.
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 for a basic renovation. When I got to the store, a series of tricks started.
The first time I went to the store, I just showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the actual site to measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 700,000 RMB. They roughly looked at their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that as soon as you go to the store, they will convince you to pay the deposit (the money is gone once you pay it, unless you have enough experience and know how to deal with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. When my brain was racing, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan.
There are many problems with the quote he gave me. It does not include the cost of water and electricity renovation, nor does it include any doors or cabinets for the bathroom. These are the main expenses for basic installation. In addition to these, their service point fees are higher than those of other companies.
I lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything to me at the beginning and made me sign a contract. When I went to them to ask for my money back, they acted like a professional team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it is, it will be the customer's problem and they are entirely responsible. There are various shifting of responsibility and many details, I don't want to go into all of them, but in general, don't choose them because my friend's house that was renovated by them was of poor quality and they will charge you various fees in the future.
Dad, they are the head of the fraudsters who deceived people before. Now they have changed their appearance and seem to have closed down and reopened under a different name. So, please don't choose this kind of fraudulent renovation company.
After everyone chooses, please take a closer look at these consultations because renovation is not a small matter. If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibited from publishing various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant registration statement for the latest merchant information, such as address, phone number, business hours, and more. Visit the public channel for 360 integration of home decoration and design in Kunming.
This is so terrifying. If you don't cancel the order within 30 minutes, please do so!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Okay, if you don't return my money within 5 to 10 days, I'll definitely pursue it.
I asked if it's possible to cancel within 15 minutes.
The chicken soup should be cooked, but what I received is raw meat, I can't eat it.
It has been 3 days without a response... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# plus monthly plan! The most strange thing is that I always use the same credit card when I pay.
Can I be exempted from paying the fee each time and have the monthly fee collected after your investigation is completed? Is that okay?
How can I contact the delivery staff?
It's already 3 o'clock, isn't it time for me to receive compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to send the package, but the rider just left it at the doorstep and left.
"还送错" is a Chinese phrase that can be translated to English as "sent wrongly" or "delivered incorrectly".
Your delivery person has already picked up your order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me that they are waiting for the delivery person who is supposed to arrive at 19:25. However, they are still not willing to leave.
After I finish my shopping, how should I handle other food delivery orders?
Where did your rider go? Do you still need to wait?
I am going to send a complaint, and if you don't cancel it, I will report it to the police.
However, my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and abuse, and I cannot tolerate such personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of evil.
If you don't want to get involved with political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized behavior. From the moment you start sending friend requests on Facebook and posting provocative posts, to trying to publish so-called "my hometown" and "my father's name" on social media, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude.
After you, you became more and more shameless in harassing me, not only did you persist in tagging me every day for six meals, but you also continued to discuss some embarrassing and humiliating remarks about me on Facebook and with your so-called friends, such as remarks about my appearance, body shape, diet, and even what I do in bed. I... I've had enough. Later, I also received messages from more friends who posted your photo and sexually harassing remarks on their Facebook accounts.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can't keep quiet anymore. After the news of my report was posted, you didn't calm down at all, but became more and more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background or your social status. In our society, it is necessary to respect both genders. Yes, you can continue with this derogatory, obscure, humiliating, and insulting language. You can also continue to say that you only care about and focus on me. You can even continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can continue to deny that it is not something you created or continue to publish all attacking statements.
No, I can't and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you. My appearance and build don't need your evaluation or praise.
I don't even think there's a woman who would be willing to humiliate herself like this for the sake of fame. Friends asked me, how are you doing?
I said so, but you won't believe it. I think no woman can be so humiliated and still say she's okay.
Regardless of whether it is in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who do not have basic moral principles will choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice is in the hearts of people.
I cut off part of the comments and sent them to everyone. I believe no one can impersonate you.
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization and I will smile.
I have reported and also attached a picture, but there has been no reply.
What's the use of a cow that doesn't have any meat? It's just mouthwatering chicken.

"Say is 7:00 sent to why need to re-produce."
"太离谱了" is a Chinese phrase that can be translated to English as "too far gone" or "beyond repair". It is often used to describe a situation where something has deteriorated to such an extent that it cannot be salvaged or fixed.
The 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Changsha, Hunan.
A member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Committee and the director of the Organization Department, Wang Cheng, attended the launching ceremony and delivered a speech. Wang Cheng pointed out that holding the talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central Conference on Talent Work and the 12th Provincial Party Congress, and it demonstrates Hunan's emphasis on talent, desire for talent, and sincere commitment to utilizing talent.
Hunan has excellent traditional culture, a vast platform for talent development, and favorable conditions for realizing a good life. In recent years, we have deeply implemented the strategy of talent-led development, with the "Floral Fragrance Talent Plan" as the driving force, and established a comprehensive talent work system from entry to retention. It has become a fertile land for talent growth, a hotbed for innovation and entrepreneurship, and an ideal place for living and working.  Currently, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "Three Highs and Four New" strategy and mission, and will further open the door to talented individuals.

The home appliances here are quite complete, with a wide range of brands and well-known brands. On December 12th, during the "12.12" shopping festival, visit the water purifier store at "Hanshun" and take a look at the water purifiers. The store is currently holding an activity and the prices are quite reasonable.
Surprisingly, the building only has 11 floors, with levels B2 to B9 designated for parking. Parking on B1 and B2 is free during the day. The surrounding area is not very impressive, with few restaurants and shops, and the food at the restaurants is average.
This elevator is also very slow, just like having a big illness, going down from floor 2 to floor 1, constantly turning back and forth, and I've been pressing the button for this floor for a long time. From the safety corridor, I went down to the first floor, but it was also very slow and directly led to a furniture store. The furniture store was closed, and I couldn't go out from the safety corridor! It turns out that even at home, there is still a need for improvement. There are many places that have not been developed.
Address: No. 55, High-speed Railway North 1st Road, Shayibake District. Transportation is convenient, and there is a large parking lot. During the day, parking is free. Environment: The store is spacious, with 8-9 floors, selling home furnishings, home appliances, and various small items... If you want to buy things for your home, you can buy them all here. Many well-known brands have set up shop in the store, such as Momth, Oulai, Huadi, Laoban, Fengchengzhi, Jacob, Yufang, Yiben, Wanjiale, Daziren, Meidi, Yadan... The number of brands is really too many, and it is a good place to buy products. After walking around, you can sit on the sofa and rest.
Recently, I want to buy a comfortable sofa set, and a friend told me that there are many sofas to choose from here. I looked at furniture stores such as Rongji and Meike, and they seem to be okay, but the prices are a bit higher, so I am still undecided. So, I am looking for the address, phone number, business hours, and the latest information on the Urumqi home furnishing store on the Douyin platform to find a decoration company.

The upper reaches of the Yangtze River have achieved full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas - Xinhua Net, December 11, 2022 (reporter Wang Xian). The Chongqing Dazu Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on the 10th of last month, following the formal operation of the Eight-Bridge Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan's Leshan City on the 8th. This is the second water-based green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation after the Leshan Water-based Green Integrated Service Area.
Thus, the green integrated service area on the water has covered the upstream, middle, and downstream of the Yangtze River. The deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, He Jianhua, introduced that in the past, provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built and put into operation 10 green integrated service areas on the Yangtze River middle and lower reaches, which have been well received by the majority of ship crews, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.
The coverage of the green integrated service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the reception of ship pollutants and enhancement of shipping services are significantly improved. It is introduced that the water-based green comprehensive service area is designed to provide comprehensive production and living services for large ships and crew, and is an important facility to help the crew solve the problem of "urgent worries and anxieties".
This time, the two water service areas on the upstream of the Yangtze River have been successfully put into operation. They are integrated service areas that combine living services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the special feature. By realizing "one-stop berthing and multiple services" for ships in the port, it will make the work of ship crew members more efficient and their lives more convenient.

However, the chicken in the box is fresh meat and cannot be eaten. Can I get a refund for the strawberries, lychees, and steamed buns that have not arrived? #PRS\_ORG# Refunded #NUMBER# yuan.
But can chicken feet be refunded because they were delivered but you couldn't eat them?
If I want to cancel, can I?
