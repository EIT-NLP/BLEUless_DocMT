ASSISTANT: The municipal education bureau requires that the admission and employment of vocational school students and the use of engineering technology by enterprises be standardized, and clearly define the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise trainees. According to the principle of reciprocal selection, vocational school students, schools, and enterprises should sign a tripartite agreement. For students who have turned 16 but have not yet turned 18, agreements must be signed by the students, their guardians, the school, and the enterprise. The agreement should determine the rights and interests of each party and specify the specific job positions, teaching content, and benefits guaranteed for the trainees during their on-the-job training. It is encouraged for pilot schools to adopt modern apprenticeship-based cooperative education with enterprises to conduct pre-employment training and on-the-job training transfer.

Generally, the top internship is 6 months. In enterprise practice, implement an enterprise-based team management mode, and according to the characteristics of different professions, a teacher can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a learning group, ensuring that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation position.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。

ASSISTANT: I want to try playing tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to find a coach who is roughly the same price as a beginner. It's not unfriendly, in fact, the price often correlates with the level of friendliness, if you can't tell the difference, then a high-priced coach may be more friendly than a cheap one, but this type of "entry-level racket" is actually industrial garbage.

它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。

ASSISTANT: They are very weak, and when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very large. Even top players find it difficult to control. The logic and hidden agenda behind their existence is - tennis is so difficult, you know you can't learn it, and you know you don't want to spend a lot of money on it, so we'll give you a cheap, messy product that you'll play with twice and never play again. This way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel sorry for it.

等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

ASSISTANT: Wait until you can truly distinguish good from bad, which indicates that you have made progress. When the time comes, come back here to buy expensive ones, and I will earn two times the money. I suggest spending a similar amount of money and buying a second-hand one that is slightly better, such as a Prince or Ding Luopu brand. These two brands are not well-known enough, so good rackets are also sold at a lower price. A new racket of 500-600 yuan is good enough, while a second-hand one costs only 200 yuan. Don't you think it's enjoyable to have a racket worth thousands of yuan?

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。

ASSISTANT: In fact, there are many discussions about the clothing and accessory matching for girls with a slim body. For girls with a pear-shaped body, the skirt should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, just enough to cover the fat thighs.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。

ASSISTANT: If you wear clothes that are divided into upper and lower sections, you will naturally appear taller. Using different colors for your top, skirt, and long socks can create a sense of length. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are a popular choice for pear-shaped women (the author has a deep understanding of this point), and dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat. Elegant black short skirts are the first choice for pear-shaped women.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。

ASSISTANT: Wearing dark-colored clothing, especially a short skirt, will make you look thinner. If you have fat legs, don't draw attention to them by wearing shoes and socks that are too noticeable.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。

ASSISTANT: The more popular it is, the better. The color should not be too bright. This is to avoid people paying too much attention to your legs and feet, giving the impression of being fat.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: For girls who are slightly overweight, it is important to learn the rules of proper clothing and accessory matching. Do not wear tight-fitting short skirts, and do not wear tops that are too short or stuffed into the skirt. This will make people feel very uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, wear black tights or patterned socks (the kind with fine grids, please). Choose a soft, floral print dress that falls below the knee, and pair it with a cardigan-style top that can effectively cover the flaws of a slightly overweight girl.

当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。

美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网新华社华盛顿５月２３日电（记者徐剑梅）美国１３０多个亚裔团体２３日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议３所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。

ASSISTANT: An Asian-American group filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process.

牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。

ASSISTANT: The Asian American Education League, which initiated the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the day of the lawsuit. The president of the organization, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission criteria of top US universities has doubled, but the proportion of Asian Americans in these three top US universities has basically remained the same.

许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: Many studies indicate that in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" admission process of these universities, "long-term continuous and systematic discrimination against Asian applicants" occurs. Zhao Yuchun introduced that in the three universities studied by Sanders et al. in 2014, the acceptance rate for Asian applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。

ASSISTANT: According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Davidson College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhou Yuxuan told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and expect the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to launch investigations and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions.

ASSISTANT: The Alliance for Asian American Education was established in 2015. At that time, they had filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to Chinese-American organizations, other organizations such as Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups have also participated in the lawsuit.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory building located in Yiwu Town, Zhejiang Province, from his house. After visiting the site multiple times, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory building. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of the purchase with the owner's family member, Ms. Lin, and transferred 200,000 yuan as a down payment through a bank transfer on the same day.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Lin signed the "Factory Warehouse Purchase and Sale Agreement" as the payee, and it was clearly stated that "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory warehouse, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not agree to sell this factory warehouse, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the buyer. Both parties agreed to sign the factory warehouse purchase and sale contract within one week." However, due to differences in the scope of the factory warehouse sale and the payment method, the two parties were unable to reach a consensus on the main contract terms, resulting in the delay of the signing of the factory warehouse purchase and sale contract.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: Considering that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contents of the contract, a few days later, Mr. Lin decided to refund the 20,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After finally finding a house that he liked, he paid the deposit and was ready to pay the remaining amount, but the seller refused to sell, which made Mr. Lu feel helpless and angry.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。

ASSISTANT: Therefore, Mr. Lu will file a lawsuit against Mr. Lin in Yueyang City People's Court. The court after hearing finds that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract and cannot solely blame the defendant. It is reasonable to assume that the negotiation failed, and thus this case should not apply to the penalty for non-payment of deposit. The defendant is not required to bear the responsibility for breaching the contract and returning double the deposit.

ASSISTANT: Lawyer's Reminder: Be cautious and exercise due diligence in the trading process. As the buyer, you should exercise caution and due diligence when signing a contract, such as verifying the information of the property owner, whether the property is occupied, and other relevant information. It is also important to clearly specify the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。

ASSISTANT: In Sabah, 320 newborn babies have not received birth certificates due to a shortage of anti-forgery paper caused by the disruption of special anti-forgery paper supply. The Sabah National Registration Office said that since the stock of special anti-forgery paper ran out in early October, they have not been able to issue birth certificates to newborn babies, and the number of affected people has reached 3,200 so far.

不过，该局主任凯鲁阿米努斯保证，所有已经申请报生纸的婴儿，资料已经记录在系统，当防伪纸在下周运到后就会补发。他在新闻发布会上，针对一家网媒指沙巴报生纸印制问题出现长达10个月的报导，作出解释。

ASSISTANT: However, the head of the bureau, Keqiuran, assured that all infants who have applied for birth certificates have had their materials recorded in the system. They will be issued once the anti-forgery certificates arrive next week. He made an explanation at a press conference regarding a report by a net media that the issue of forged birth certificates in Sabah has lasted for 10 months.

他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。

ASSISTANT: He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used in Sabah is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states.

ASSISTANT: The office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur next Wednesday to purchase goods, and they will immediately proceed to the final stage of printing upon their return to Sabah. It is estimated that it will take about two working days (December 20th) to deliver to the applicant.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。

ASSISTANT: The State Council Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism recently issued a notice on strengthening the epidemic prevention and control work in border cities. The notice requires that people who leave land border cities (excluding those with a border with Hong Kong and Macao) within the next 48 hours must have a negative nucleic acid test result within the past 48 hours. After arriving at the land border city, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。

ASSISTANT: According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determination and announcement of the port city range in each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government to March 15, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that under certain conditions, port cities may conduct research on setting up epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdictions.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

ASSISTANT: The National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau has introduced that for some border cities, cross-border trade is the main pillar of the local economy, and there is frequent exchange between the two sides of the border. Implementing differentiated management policies based on regional differences can turn a single control line into two control lines, which may achieve the goal of moving the front line of the epidemic and reducing the risk of epidemic spreading, with the aim of achieving the maximum epidemic prevention effect with the minimum social impact and cost.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。

ASSISTANT: Recently, there have been multiple local outbreaks of the epidemic in our country, all of which were imported from overseas epidemic areas through border cities. The above notice points out that this exposes some problems such as delayed and inadequate local epidemic monitoring and early warning, inadequate implementation of closed-loop management for high-risk personnel, formalism in regular nucleic acid testing, insufficient disinfection of cold chain materials in various segments, inadequate management of centralized isolation facilities, and insufficient scientific and accurate handling of the epidemic emergency.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。

ASSISTANT: Notice Requesting Efforts to Strengthen Epidemic Prevention and Control Mechanisms in Port Cities, Improve Infectious Disease Monitoring and Early Warning Systems, and Implement Border Control Measures from Nine Perspectives, with a Focus on Filling Gaps in Epidemic Prevention and Control in Port Cities, Ensuring that No Effort is Spared and Work is Done Scientifically and Accurately, and Strengthening the Front Line of Epidemic Prevention and Control. The notice emphasizes that port cities should synchronize epidemic prevention and control with public welfare guarantees, publish hotlines for public welfare guarantees, regularly check and resolve hidden dangers in the supply of basic necessities such as food and prices, and promptly respond to and proactively address prominent issues raised by the public.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

根据通知，其中所指的口岸城市包括开放的陆路、水路、航空口岸所在县（市、区、旗 ） 、 所在市（地、州、盟）及所在直辖市，具体范围由各省（自治区、直辖市）根据疫情防控需要确定并及时公告。

ASSISTANT: According to the notice, the cities referred to include the open land, water, and air ports, as well as the counties (cities, districts, banners) where they are located, the cities (autonomous regions, states, leagues) where they are located, and the directly-administered cities. The specific scope shall be determined by each province (autonomous region, directly-administered city) based on epidemic prevention and control needs and announced in a timely manner.

ASSISTANT: The vast majority of people will be intimidated by the word "transformation" and hesitate, unable to take the first step forward. Alternatively, they may make a rash decision based on a momentary impulse and boldly take the first step, but it is often short-lived, and they give up within a short period of time, making it difficult to see the continuity.

ASSISTANT: The biggest problem with "the best principle" is that the threshold is too high, and it often exceeds the limits of ordinary people's abilities, making most people feel overwhelmed and give up. Perhaps "the second best principle" could be a way for more ordinary people to achieve relative success.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。

ASSISTANT: The core of the "Second Principle" is to "lower the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "gathering small victories," that is, if you can't do 100, it's okay to do just 1: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, it's okay to only climb the small sand hill in front of your door, because that's also stronger than just standing still. In summary, as long as you've done something, it's always stronger than doing nothing.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。

ASSISTANT: Due to the significant reduction of barriers, it has increased the possibility for ordinary people to persevere and achieve success. As long as one is persistent, the chance of success will also increase. However, following the "second-rate principle" to achieve success, the path may be slightly longer.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: In summary, the "best principle" may appear to be a banner for everyone's success, but in reality, it only motivates a small number of people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" is more effective in motivating a larger number of people and maximizing their benefits.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。

ASSISTANT: According to a report from the reporters Li Xiaofeng and Zhang Hongxiao of the Xinhua News Agency, the latest monitoring results show that the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 million tons this year, reaching 10.85 million tons. This is an increase of 40 times compared to the initial protection period in 2002.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。

ASSISTANT: Qinghai Lake carp is a local name for the fish, and it is a precious fish species unique to Qinghai Lake. It plays an important role in maintaining the ecological safety and biodiversity of the "water-fish-bird" ecosystem in the Qinghai Lake watershed. In the 1960s and 1970s, the fish was severely depleted due to overfishing, habitat degradation, and other human factors. By 2002, the resource stock of Qinghai Lake carp had decreased to only 2592 tons.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: In 2004, the Chinese red list of endangered species listed the naked carp from Qinghai Lake as an endangered species. Since 2003, the Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake and prohibited any unit, collective, or individual from fishing for naked carp in the main rivers and tributaries of the lake. It is also prohibited to sell naked carp and their products.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。

ASSISTANT: At the same time, through artificial breeding and stocking, as well as the cleaning of the main inlet and outlet rivers of Qinghai Lake and the design of scientifically reasonable "passageways" for fish, the protection measures have been continuously strengthened. As a result, the resource storage capacity of Qinghai Lake's grass carp has increased year by year. Yang Lin, deputy director of the Department of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, a total of nearly 1.8 million grass carp have been artificially bred and stocked, with a contribution rate of over 23% to the restoration of Qinghai Lake's grass carp resources.

青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。

ASSISTANT: The Qinghai Three Rivers Source Region is a crucial ecological barrier and water-sustaining area not only in China but also in Asia, while Qinghai Lake serves as a natural ecological barrier and functional area that controls the expansion of the western desert to the east. In order to protect the ecological environment and water-sustaining wildlife in the Three Rivers Source Region and the water body of Qinghai Lake, as well as maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, since this year, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment has issued emergency bans on fishing in key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and has established a comprehensive ban on fishing management system under the slogan "One River, One River, One Lake".

随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。

ASSISTANT: With the strengthening of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly loved by consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety hazards.

ASSISTANT: At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet.

ASSISTANT: Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they refused to return the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable. This is because he found that the popular bathtub that has been around for a long time does not have any clear and detailed industry regulations on issues such as the maximum temperature setting, the intended user group, and the materials used to ensure safety.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。

ASSISTANT: A programming beginner who wants to share their personal experience. If you plan to enter this industry, you can choose to go to a training place, but if you don't have this idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the cost of training is very high, and you need to spend 6 months to learn.

但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。

Training is also a very good choice for them. If you have strong self-sufficiency, you can also choose to self-study, but it may be more tiring.

当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before choosing a training institution, it is recommended to inquire about the institution and its students. After all, only the students of the institution can truly know the quality of the institution and whether the course explanations are good or not. Hello, I'm sorry, but I don't know how to answer your question as I don't have enough information about your personal situation.

比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。

ASSISTANT: For example, professional background, age, desired language, and even the city you want to study or work in will be related to the industry you want to study or work in. If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has already graduated, if you have enough time, I personally recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective way. Nowadays, many offline and online training institutions are also very good, but the cost of learning is relatively high, and the investment of time is relatively large. Generally, you need to concentrate on training for 3-6 months.

ASSISTANT: However, if it is the situation I mentioned, self-study is very convenient. There are many free learning resources available online now, or you can also find training resources on B station.

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but can afford to pay a certain amount of learning cost and time, then I suggest you go to a training institution to learn. This way, you can learn without putting in too much effort, and the teachers' explanations are very detailed. If you have any questions, there will be someone to answer them. In addition, many training institutions now have employment agreements, with internal referral quotas, and they will recommend you to companies after you finish your studies.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

ASSISTANT: Although right-wing forces have had periods of success in history, they have not lasted long. This is because they shine briefly when they get a little bit of sunlight and break out into a sweat when they drink a little bit of water. Even if they have some success, they are quickly defeated and their leaders are captured. However, when it comes to the facts, right-wing forces have played an active role in promoting social progress.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。

ASSISTANT: From the end of the Cultural Revolution to defining the standard of truth, promoting economic development, enhancing technology, and promoting institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the right-wing cannot be denied. Thirdly, for my part, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements and very respectful of Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincere in his view of China's social problems.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: However, I disagree with his anti-communist theory. I believe that revolution is necessary, and revolution inevitably leads to social unrest, damages to the people's livelihood, and chaos in political parties. Furthermore, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation. Fourthly, changing or improving China requires patience and a responsible attitude towards the country and the people. Those who engage in political opportunism and try to profit from the situation are not rightists, but rather a bunch of misfits.

如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。

ASSISTANT: If the right has any positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts when needed. However, the left has lost its credibility because it only wants what the Communist Party has discarded.

Fifthly, I recently saw some friends scolding the enemy and refuting the leftists. They were quite passionate, but I think it's unnecessary.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the enemy insults you with five cents, and when the left-wing insults you as a right-wing dog, it just proves that our middle road is correct! Many people also had ideals when they were young, but after they grew up, they forgot about them, or pursued them, but ended up becoming obsessive.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。

ASSISTANT: The ideal gradually recedes into the distance, even to the point where the young dragon becomes the evil dragon. I think the left and right are generally referring to constraints and freedom. China, due to its historical and cultural genetic predisposition, should be inherently inclined towards the left.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: In China, the right-wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left-wing strengthens regulation and places more emphasis on fairness and safety. Currently, society as a whole desires more emphasis on fairness, while China and the United States are in competition, and the left-wing is generally accepted, and it is expected to continue for many years to come.

ASSISTANT: 【Island Peak State】It refers to the rapid rise in temperature due to human intervention, causing a surge in hot searches and attracting public attention.
【Sawtooth State】It refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic stays on the hot search rankings.
【Cliff State】It refers to collective withdrawal, where the hot search has fulfilled its "function", and it is assigned a new task or moves to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of one event's heat wave coincides with the trough of another event's heat wave, with time intervals of seconds, which must be the unified water army receiving a task and launching a new round of offensives.

ASSISTANT: The professionalism of Xiaohongguan is evident in the fact that several hot search terms are simultaneously trending, and which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for knowledge dissemination, which ones provoke conflicts, which ones shift attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, which ones manipulate decisions, which ones are divided into batches, and which ones are fine-tuned at different nodes. Almost all elements of the spread of public opinion are considered in the fine-tuning of Xiaohongguan's account.

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: The first time I went to the store, I just showed them my floor plan. They didn't go to the actual site to measure the house, but they were able to give me a quote saying that my 135 square meter house could be done for 700,000 RMB. They roughly looked at their materials, but I didn't know what brand of materials they were. Their second scam was that as soon as you go to the store, they will convince you to pay the deposit (the money is gone once you pay it, unless you have enough experience and know how to deal with them).

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit to us today, we can give you such and such a discount. This is a big trap, and I am a living example of being deceived. When my brain was racing, I paid a deposit of over 10,000 yuan.

长江干流实现水上绿色综合服务区全覆盖-新华网新华社武汉12月11日电（记者王贤）重庆市涪陵水上绿色综合服务区10日如期建成投入运营，这是继8日四川省泸州水上绿色综合服务区挂牌运营后，长江上游正式运营的第2个水上绿色综合服务区。

ASSISTANT: The upper reaches of the Yangtze River have achieved full coverage of water-based green integrated service areas - Xinhua Net, December 11, 2022 (reporter Wang Xian). The Chongqing Dazu Water-based Green Integrated Service Area was officially put into operation on the 10th of last month, following the formal operation of the Eight-Bridge Water-based Green Integrated Service Area in Sichuan's Leshan City on the 8th. This is the second water-based green integrated service area on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to be officially put into operation after the Leshan Water-based Green Integrated Service Area.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

至此，水上绿色综合服务区已覆盖长江上、中、下游。交通运输部长江航务管理局副局长邱健华介绍说，此前，湖北、湖南、江西、安徽、江苏等省份已在长江中游、下游建成运行10个水上绿色综合服务区，得到了广大船员的认可，为推进长江航运高质量发展发挥了重要作用。

ASSISTANT: Thus, the green integrated service area on the water has covered the upstream, middle, and downstream of the Yangtze River. The deputy director of the Yangtze River Navigation Bureau of the Ministry of Transport, He Jianhua, introduced that in the past, provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu have built and put into operation 10 green integrated service areas on the Yangtze River middle and lower reaches, which have been well received by the majority of ship crews, and have played an important role in promoting the high-quality development of Yangtze River navigation.

水上绿色综合服务区全覆盖是长江绿色航运建设的又一里程碑事件，长江船舶污染物接收、航运服务能力得到显著提升。据介绍，水上绿色综合服务区是为广大船舶、船员提供全方位生产、生活服务，帮助广大船员解决“急难愁盼”问题的重要设施。

ASSISTANT: The coverage of the green integrated service area on the water is another milestone event in the construction of the Yangtze River green shipping, and the reception of ship pollutants and enhancement of shipping services are significantly improved. It is introduced that the water-based green comprehensive service area is designed to provide comprehensive production and living services for large ships and crew, and is an important facility to help the crew solve the problem of "urgent worries and anxieties".

此次建成运行的长江上游两处水上绿色综合服务区，集生活服务、生产服务和政务服务为一体，以绿色环保为主题，以船舶维修与船舶应急救援服务为特色，实现港内船舶“一次靠泊、多项服务 ” ， 将使得常年航行在长江的船员工作更高效、生活更便捷。

ASSISTANT: This time, the two water service areas on the upstream of the Yangtze River have been successfully put into operation. They are integrated service areas that combine living services, production services, and government services, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and ship emergency rescue services as the special feature. By realizing "one-stop berthing and multiple services" for ships in the port, it will make the work of ship crew members more efficient and their lives more convenient.
