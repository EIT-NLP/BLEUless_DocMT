ASSISTANT: Spread the word: emergency measures are actually for emergency rescue in case of sudden events, that is, pre-hospital first aid before the ambulance arrives. As we all know, there is a certain period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and this period is the most critical.

想尝试一下网球，但又怕自己坚持不下去，所以想先找个差不多的价格练手 。不友好，事实上，价格往往与友好程度成正比，如果不能分辨，那么贵的正常情况会比便宜的拍子友好，这类“入门拍”其实是工业垃圾。

ASSISTANT: I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to practice with a racket that's not too expensive first. Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then a more expensive racket will be friendlier than a cheaper one, and this kind of "beginner racket" is actually industrial garbage.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

它们强度很低，球打到拍子上面，振动非常大，硬球顶不住，高手都很难驾驭。它们存在的逻辑和潜台词是———网球这么难，知道你们学不会，也知道你们不舍得买贵的，搞个便宜货糊弄你们，你们玩儿两次，就不会再打了，这样这个拍子便宜，你也不心疼。

ASSISTANT: They are very weak, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very big, even the professional players can't control it. Their existence is based on the logic of "badminton is so difficult, you can't learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so we cheat you with cheap ones. You will play twice and never play again. In this way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel guilty."

等你真的能分辨好坏，说明你进步了，到时候再来我这里买贵的，我赚两次钱。建议花相似的价钱，买个二手好一点的球拍，选择prince、或者邓禄普的，这两个品牌足够没名气，所以好球拍也卖不上价钱，新拍500、600就很好了，二手的200块，拥有千元拍的享受不香吗？

ASSISTANT: When you can truly distinguish good from bad, it means you have progressed. Come back and buy from me then, and I'll make twice the profit. I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a used racket that's in good condition, such as a Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not as well-known, so good rackets can't be sold for a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 is already very good, and a used one for 200 is a bargain. Wouldn't you enjoy the experience of having a thousand-dollar racket for just 200 bucks?

其实对于身体微胖的女孩子穿衣搭配的讲究很多。身体胖的女孩穿的裙子不能太短或太长，长度差不多在膝盖，刚好能盖住大腿胖的地方即可。

ASSISTANT: In fact, there is a lot of emphasis on dressing for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls with heavier bodies, the length of their skirts should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, covering the fleshy part of the thighs.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

裙子过短就会把腿上的肥胖显露出来。过长就会给人矮而胖的感觉。

ASSISTANT: If the skirt is too short, it will expose the excess weight on the legs. If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果穿出分出上中下三段来，就显得你自然增高了，就是上身、裙和长筒袜用不同的颜色，看上去就会产生一种修长的感觉 。其实很多深色系的衣服是微胖女孩子们的标配（这一点作者深有体会），深颜色也是掩盖你身体胖的好方法，高贵典雅的黑色短裙也是微胖女孩的首选。

ASSISTANT: If you separate the upper, middle, and lower three sections, it will seem like you have naturally grown taller. Using different colors for the upper body, skirt, and long socks creates a sense of elongation. Actually, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide excess weight, and a noble and elegant black mini-skirt is a top choice for chubby girls.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

穿上深颜色的衣服，特别是黑色的短裙，会让人觉得你瘦一些。如果小腿很胖，你的袜子和鞋不要穿得太让人注意。

ASSISTANT: Wearing clothes in dark colors, especially black short skirts, can make you look slimmer. If you have fat legs, don't draw too much attention to your socks and shoes.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

越大众化越好，颜色也不要太鲜艳了。以免人们对你的腿部和脚部注意时，让人得到肥胖的感觉。

ASSISTANT: The more standardized, the better. Avoid using colors that are too vibrant to prevent people from noticing your legs and feet, which may give them the impression that you are overweight.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

对于微微稍胖的女孩子一定要讲就好穿衣搭配的诀窍。微胖女孩千万不要穿紧身的短裙，另外上衣不要过短或者塞在裙子里，会让人看了很不舒服，如果腿粗的话，要穿黑色的长筒袜或者网格袜(细格子的那种哦)，选择质地柔软的印花喇叭裙，搭配一件荡领的上衣，可以很好的掩盖胖女孩的不足。

ASSISTANT: For girls who are a bit chubby, it's important to know some tricks about clothing coordination. Chubby girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and tops shouldn't be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which can make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, you should wear black opaque tights or grid tights (the kind with fine grids), and choose A-line skirts with printed patterns. Pair them with a blouse with a flared collar, which can effectively cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls.

当然了，微胖的女孩儿在穿短裙上也是有讲究的。胖女孩穿短裙，应该选择与短裙的颜色一致的上衣，这样会使你胖胖的身材有增加高度的效果。

ASSISTANT: Of course, even a chubby girl can be particular about wearing short skirts. When a chubby girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make her figure look taller.

The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission criteria of top American universities has increased many times, but the proportion of Asians in the three top American universities has remained at the same level.

许多研究表明，这些高校在所谓“综合考量”的招生过程中 ， “ 长期持续性以及系统化地歧视亚裔申请学生 ” 。赵宇空介绍说，２０１４年桑德斯等学者的研究显示，在这３所高校里，相对申请者人数，亚裔在所有族裔中录取率最低。

ASSISTANT: Numerous studies have shown that these universities engage in systemic and persistent discrimination against Asian American applicants in the so-called "holistic" admissions process. Zhao Yusong introduced and said that the research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asian Americans was the lowest among all racial groups in proportion to the number of applicants.

美国教育部的数据也显示，在所有常春藤盟校中，布朗大学和达特茅斯学院对亚裔学生的录取比例最低，耶鲁大学和布朗大学对亚裔申请学生实施了事实上的种族配额达２０年以上。赵宇空告诉新华社记者，他们期望提交申诉后，美国教育部、司法部能够展开调查，并在认定事实后采取措施阻止这些高校继续在招生中歧视亚裔。

ASSISTANT: According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian-Americans in recruitment after determining the facts.

ASSISTANT: The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's appeal also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。

ASSISTANT: In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yushan, Yongjia Town, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing the factory with the owner's family member, Lin Xi, and transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank as a deposit on the same day.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。

ASSISTANT: Mr. Lin signed as the recipient of the deposit on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Agreement," which stipulated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week." However, due to disagreements on the scope of the factory for sale, payment methods, and other major contract terms, the parties were unable to form a unified opinion and the real estate purchase and sale contract was not signed for a long time.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

ASSISTANT: Considering that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After carefully selecting the house, paying the deposit, and preparing the down payment, all that was left was to sign the contract. However, the seller refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu at a loss and angry.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。

ASSISTANT: For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yuyang Municipal People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double compensation for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit.

ASSISTANT: Lawyer's Reminder: It is necessary to exercise caution in the transaction process. As the buyer, you should exercise necessary caution when signing the contract, such as verifying the information of the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information, and clearly specifying the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。

ASSISTANT: 320 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (Sabah, Malaysia, November 11, 2022) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper being exposed to light, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people so far.

ASSISTANT: However, the director of the Immigration Department, K. Arumugam, assured that the information of all infants who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and the fake certificates will be replaced after the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week. He explained in response to a news report by an online media outlet that the issue of counterfeit birth certificates in Sabah had persisted for up to 10 months.

他解释，沙巴报生纸使用的防伪纸和其他地区不同，因此不能商借其他州属的存货。凯鲁阿米努斯透露，最新一批防伪纸已经于本月6日运抵吉隆坡，过后于8日交给印刷公司，进行部分印制工作。

ASSISTANT: He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' inventory. Kiru Amynius revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work to be done.

ASSISTANT: "The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to place an order on Wednesday next week. After returning to Sabah, they will proceed with the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two working days (December 20th) to deliver the documents to the applicants."

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。

ASSISTANT: The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has issued a notice requiring people who have recently left land ports of entry cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to present negative nucleic acid test certificates within 48 hours, and those entering land ports of entry cities to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. This measure aims to strengthen the epidemic control in port cities.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。

ASSISTANT: According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city scope and announcing it in each province, district, and city to March 15th, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that if conditions permit, port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

ASSISTANT: The person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a major economic support for the local area, and the exchanges between the two sides are frequent. By implementing a differentiated management policy based on regions, the single line of defense for epidemic prevention and control can become two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the relocation of the port of entry, compress the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

近期我国发生多起本土聚集性疫情，均是境外疫情经口岸城市输入。上述通知指出，这暴露出一些地方疫情监测预警不及时、高风险岗位人员闭环管理不落实、定期核酸检测流于形式、冷链物品各环节消杀不到位、集中隔离场所管理不规范、疫情应急处置不够科学精准等问题。

ASSISTANT: Recently, there have been several local clustered outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry in cities. The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposes some problems such as insufficient real-time monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

通知要求，从完善口岸城市疫情防控机制、健全疫情监测预警体系、落实边境管控措施等9个方面着力，加快补齐口岸城市防控短板弱项，毫不放松、科学精准做好防控工作，织密扎牢外防输入防线。通知强调，各口岸城市要将疫情防控与民生保障工作同步研究、同步部署，公布并畅通民生保障热线，定期排查基本生活物资供应、价格等方面的苗头隐患，及时解决和主动回应群众反映的突出问题。

ASSISTANT: Notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control system at the border port city, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to strengthen the weak links in the port city's epidemic prevention and control work, without any relaxation, and to do the work of epidemic prevention and control in a scientific and accurate manner, to tighten the external prevention and control line. The notice emphasizes that all port cities should coordinate the epidemic prevention and control work with the work of ensuring people's livelihood, publicize and open up the hotline for people's livelihood protection, and regularly investigate and solve the hidden dangers in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the masses.

ASSISTANT: According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include those with open land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), municipalities (prefectures, cities, autonomous regions), and directly administered municipalities, with the specific scope to be determined and announced by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on epidemic prevention and control needs.

现今的成功学书籍，很多宣扬的都是“最好原则 ” — —即先假定或暗示你能“做到 ” ， 然后再告诉你需要做到的事情“是什么 ” 。等于说一下子越过了“如何做到”这个其实最重要、最根本的环节。

ASSISTANT: Many successful self-help books today emphasize the "best principle" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it."

正因如此，这些书都有一个共同的特点 — — 要么就一鼓作气地干到最好，要么就干脆什么也别干；要么就是100，要么就是0；要么你就登泰山，要么你就干脆在原地待着。这种“最好原则 ” ， 让谁看都会承认“正确无比 ” ， 但是99%的人都会被吓倒在起跑线前。

ASSISTANT: Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - they either go all out and do their best, or they don't do anything at all; they're either a 100, or they're a 0; they either make it to the top of the mountain, or they stay put where they are. This "do your best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it's "extremely correct," but 99% of people are intimidated before they even start.

因为这种理论鼓吹的是一种“你要痛下决心，重新做人，来个180度的大转变”的路径，而这恰恰是很多人的致命弱项。对于墨守成规、因循守旧、拒绝变化的人，你偏偏要在他的耳旁大喊“你要转变 ” ， 无疑是自欺欺人、对牛弹琴之举。

ASSISTANT: Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a decisive decision to transform yourself and undergo a 180-degree change," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who are conservative, stick to the old ways, and refuse to change, you will definitely shout loudly in their ears "you must transform," which is undoubtedly self-deception and a futile gesture.

ASSISTANT: Most people will feel fearful and hesitant before the word "transformation," taking small steps and finding it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, they may impulsively make a decision to undergo "transformation" and boldly take the first step, but this is often short-lived, and they quickly lose momentum and fail to see the sustainability in it. Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue "Starting from Tomorrow" perfectly illustrates this "universal human nature."

ASSISTANT: The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "despair and sigh." Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that may allow more ordinary people to achieve relatively successful paths.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。

ASSISTANT: The core principle of "次好原则" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100%, doing 1% is still okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is also okay, because that is still better than walking on the ground. In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing.

由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。

ASSISTANT: Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it is now possible for ordinary people to persevere, and with perseverance, the chances of success will increase. However, following the path to success by adhering to the "80% principle" may take a slightly longer journey.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

ASSISTANT: In summary, the "best principle" may wave the banner of making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can effectively motivate only a few people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。

ASSISTANT: Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increase by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) According to the latest monitoring results, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative increase has exceeded 40 times. The news was learned from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。

ASSISTANT: The naked carp, also known as the "Yan fish" in the local dialect, is a valuable fish species found only in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human over-fishing and deterioration of the breeding environment, the population of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply declined, and by 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake had decreased to only 2,592 tons.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

ASSISTANT: In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, as well as banning the sale of naked carp and its products.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。

ASSISTANT: At the same time, through artificial propagation and cleaning up the main river channels of the rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, as well as designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the province has continuously increased its efforts to protect the Qinghai Lake naked carp resources. The deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of 1.8 billion naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing to the recovery rate of the Qinghai Lake naked carp resources exceeding 23%.

青海三江源地区是我国乃至亚洲重要的生态屏障和水源涵养区，而青海湖是控制西部荒漠化向东蔓延的天然屏障和生态功能区。为了保护三江源地区和青海湖水域生态环境、保护水生野生动物，维护青藏高原生物多样性，今年以来，青海先后发布长江、黄河、青海湖重点水域禁捕通告，构建起了“一江一河一湖”全面禁捕管理体系。

ASSISTANT: The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water source nurturing zone not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of western desertification to the east. To protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

随着人们保健意识的增强，足浴盆越来越受到消费者的喜爱，在市场上也涌现出一大批档次不同的产品，从一百多元到上千元的足浴盆琳琅满目，给了消费者很大的选择空间。在相关的数据表面，与传统家电相比，足浴盆等保健类家电销售火爆，但足浴盆并没有专门行业标准，因此存在一定的安全隐患。

ASSISTANT: With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. In terms of related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot bath basins and other health-related household appliances are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, which poses certain safety risks.

ASSISTANT: Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet. Mr. Li tried using a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conducting electricity.

ASSISTANT: Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath basin was returned, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied. Because he found that this popular foot bath basin for a long time had no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of applicable temperature range, target population, and material safety guarantees.

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。

ASSISTANT: A beginner programmer who wants to share their personal experience. If you are planning to enter this industry, you can consider finding a place to receive training, but if you don't have that idea, it's better to self-study. After all, the money spent on training is very expensive, and you need to spend 6 months on learning.

但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。

当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institution would be meaningless. Of course, some newly-established training institutions may not have particularly strong faculty strength.

ASSISTANT: Secondly, before making a decision, it's a good idea to investigate this training institution. It's best to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the courses are. Actually, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your personal circumstances.

比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。

ASSISTANT: For example, factors such as profession, age, and the language you want to learn may be related to the industry you want to pursue. If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has already graduated, in my personal opinion, if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are also many offline and online training institutions that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.

但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

ASSISTANT: However, if it's about the situations I mentioned, self-study is quite convenient now, as there are many free learning resources available online, or you can find training resources on Bilibili.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。

ASSISTANT: If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of study fees and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. This way of learning does not have to be very tiring, and the teachers will explain in detail. If you have any questions, there will be people dedicated to answering them. In addition, training institutions can also provide assistance in study planning or supervision. Moreover, nowadays many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after studying, which can save a lot of trouble in the later job interview stage.

ASSISTANT: The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the employment of poverty-stricken laborers and other disadvantaged rural groups, which play an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment income, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects. This new regulation is jointly issued by the Yunnan Civil Affairs, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly standardizes the scope of recruitment subjects, financial management, position development, and position management for the recruitment of personnel for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.

在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

ASSISTANT: In terms of on-the-job development arrangements, the new regulations clearly stipulate that they should be carried out according to the principles of "needs-based positioning, on-the-job determination, dynamic management, and overall quantity control" and the principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" as well as "one person, one post, voluntary publicity, and unified management." The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

ASSISTANT: In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the relevant departments to supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions. The regulations also stipulate that the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for the personnel in rural public welfare positions, and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

ASSISTANT: Although the rightists had a period of triumph in history, it was not long-lasting. They flourished when they received a bit of sunshine and sweated when they drank some water. As soon as they achieved their goals, they became arrogant and overconfident, and then suffered setbacks. However, when it comes to seeking the truth and promoting social progress, the rightists have played a positive role.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。

ASSISTANT: From defining the truth standard after the end of the Cultural Revolution to promoting economic development, technological advancement, and political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied. Three, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I am interested in his views and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

ASSISTANT: But I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I believe that resistance is necessary, but revolution will inevitably lead to social upheaval, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic mixture of political groups. Then, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation. Fourthly, to change or improve China requires patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to reap benefits from chaos are not rightists, but scoundrels.

再聊聊左。左，其实是一帮时代和政治的弃儿。

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果说右具有对社会的积极意义，共产党还会在需要的时候听取一些右的言论和分析他们的思想，那么左就没这造化了，因为左所要的正是共产党所扔掉的糟粕！五、最近看到一些朋友边怼反贼边驳左癫，还挺动真气，我觉得大可不必。

ASSISTANT: If we say that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their ideas when necessary. However, the left does not have this kind of thinking, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away! Recently, I have seen some friends who are angry at both traitors and the left, and they are full of energy. I think it is not necessary.

跟汉奸跟左癫都不要试图讲理，都是一根儿筋，无理可讲。也不要试图证明咱们是正确的，更不要想着让反贼和左癫承认，何必呢？

USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。

ASSISTANT: I tell my friends: When the counter-revolutionaries curse you for five mao and the leftists curse you as a right dog, it just proves that our middle way is the right way! Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget them or become obsessed with them as they get older.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。

ASSISTANT: As the ideal recedes further and further, even the young dragon slayer eventually becomes an evil dragon. I feel that the concept of "left and right" generally refers to restraint and freedom, and due to China's inherent genetic predisposition from its historical and cultural background, China as a whole tends to lean towards the left.
USER: Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

ASSISTANT: Internally, the right wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens regulation and places greater emphasis on fairness and safety. Now, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and it is certain that the left wing will prevail in the ongoing struggle between China and the United States. It is estimated that this trend will continue for many years to come.

ASSISTANT: Randomly select three hot topics: February 2nd dragon raises its head, Klar raises prices, and the event of goods being transported by trucks. The public opinion spreads and forms a wave peak, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and finally dissipates. If there is a secondary wave of public opinion, there will be a small hump that reappears.

ASSISTANT: [Peak shape] refers to human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; [Sawtooth shape] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search rankings; [Cliff shape] refers to collective withdrawal, indicating that the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to take on a new task and move to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of heat for one event coincides with the trough of another event, the time difference is only a few seconds, indicating that the unified water army has been assigned a new task and launched a new round of attacks.

黑公关的专业化可见一斑：几十个热搜同时上榜，哪些吸引目光、哪些负责科普、哪些引战造势、哪些转移视线、哪些影响认知、哪些误导判断、哪些煽动情感、哪些裹挟决策，黑产账号分批次、分节点精细化作战，几乎考虑到舆情传播扩散中的所有要素。传播是一门科学，抛开立场、情感所有主观因素，仅从客观数据，黑公关也会无处遁形。

ASSISTANT: The professionalization of black PR is evident in its diversity: dozens of trending topics appear on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones lead the trend, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones stimulate emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, black PR accounts are divided into batches and targeted at different nodes, almost considering all the elements of the spread of public opinion. Spreading is a science, putting aside subjective factors such as stance and emotions, black PR will be nowhere to be found when it comes to objective data.

我是第一次到店只是给他们看了我的户型图，他们并没有去实地量过房子，他们居然就能给我报价说我的135的房子7万是可以搞定的，大概的给我看了一下他们的材料也并不知道他们是什么品牌的材料。他们的第二套骗术就是你只要到店就会拖着你把定金交了（而这个钱一旦交了你是永远退不出来，除非你有足够的经历和他们打理论战）。

ASSISTANT: I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote saying my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, and didn't even know what brand they were. Their second trick is to get you to pay the deposit as soon as you come to the store (and once you pay, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).

我在犹豫要不要交定金的时候，他们就会邀请他们所谓的经理来告诉你，你今天只要把定金交了我们就能给你多少的优惠。这个就是一个大坑，我就是活生生被骗的例子，在头脑冲动的时候，交了一万多的定金。

ASSISTANT: When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I was cheated alive and well. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan of deposit.

ASSISTANT: The two water-based green comprehensive service areas established this time on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River integrate life services, production services, and government services as one, with green environmental protection as the main theme and ship repair and emergency rescue services as the highlight. They will achieve the "one-stop docking, multiple services" for ships in the port area, making it more efficient and convenient for sailors who have been navigating the Yangtze River for many years.
