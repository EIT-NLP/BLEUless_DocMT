Please cancel the order, thank you.
A meaningful certificate - the first aid certificate is one of the important skill certificates besides the driver's license that I think is valuable!
Spread the word: emergency measures are actually for emergency rescue in case of sudden events, that is, pre-hospital first aid before the ambulance arrives. As we all know, there is a certain period of time between the occurrence of an accident and the arrival of the ambulance, and this period is the most critical.
At this point, it is a time of emergency. If I really have a heart disease, cerebral hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, the golden four minutes!
So having someone nearby who knows first aid is really important! When someone nearby collapses, we can use our professional knowledge to rescue them, instead of just standing there helplessly, unable to do anything. The feeling of being helpless is too scary.
In China, we have official data showing that there are 300,000 accidental deaths each year, with cardiac arrest being the most dangerous. In the United States, the national average is 15% of those who can be saved.
In Las Vegas casino hotels, 70% to 80% can be saved, while in Shanghai and Beijing it is less than 1%. This is what the founder of the first response said.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest with no breathing and no pulse, CPR is useless. Artificial respiration and chest compressions must be performed to potentially save the person's life.
I have found that we currently have very few people who are aware of the importance of learning first aid, but when an emergency arises, it is too late. Therefore, I still call on everyone to learn this skill so that we can respond promptly in emergency situations. Who knows, we might even be able to save someone's life!
You can sign up for first aid certification at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Zhuhai, and there are also discounts for students. PS: The last picture is a record of my goal to complete before turning 25. Adding first aid certification to my goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I did complete it!
After that, I want to take other certificates that I want to take. I plan to take a scuba diving certificate, and I saw on Xiaohongshu that there is also a scuba diving first aid certificate. It seems that you need to have a first aid certificate to take this certificate, so in fact, the first aid certificate is still very useful!

Chongqing launches pilot program for modern apprenticeship system in vocational schools  Starting this year, Chongqing will implement the pilot program for the modern apprenticeship system in 60 vocational schools. Students who participate in the pilot program will have both student and apprentice identities. After enrollment, they will be pre-recorded as employees of the pilot enterprises.
The Municipal Education Commission requires standardization of the recruitment and employment procedures for middle vocational schools and enterprises, clarifying the dual identities of middle vocational school students and enterprise probationary employees, adhering to the principle of mutual choice, and signing tripartite agreements between students, schools, and enterprises. For students who have reached the age of 16 but have not yet reached the age of 18, agreements must be signed by the students, their guardians, schools, and enterprises to determine the rights and interests of all parties and the specific positions, teaching content, and benefit guarantees for the students' on-the-job training. The commission encourages pilot schools to adopt modern forms of the student system and jointly conduct enterprise employee pre-job training and transfer training with cooperating enterprises.
Pilot schools aim to reform the mode of talent cultivation. Schools and enterprises jointly design talent cultivation plans, jointly formulate professional teaching standards, course standards, post standards, enterprise mentor standards, quality monitoring standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
As a pilot program, the internship period for students will be determined according to the vocational talent training plan during their internship in enterprises. Generally, the top-level internship lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, the enterprise team management mode should be implemented, and one mentor can lead 2-5 apprentices to form a study group to ensure that students can master the skills required for each rotational position.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, our city determined 60 municipal-level intermediate vocational student pilot sites in three batches. The number of students in each pilot site was around 50, and a total of around 3,000 students were trained (as students). Following the principle of pilot sites first and then promotion, the city and enterprises will gradually promote the establishment of a long-term mechanism for joint recruitment, joint training, and integrated education and employment. This aims to effectively improve the technical skills of students on the job, increase the employment rate and quality of graduates.
"My app shows as delivered, but I haven't received it yet."

I live in Shek Wu Hui, why would the delivery address be wrong to He Hui Flower Garden?
I have considered this vacuum cleaner for a long time, and finally decided to buy it. The suction power is not bad, and there is less dust in the house now. However, holding it with one hand feels a bit heavy, and the wet mop needs improvement as it leaves residue when removing it. Overall, I am satisfied with this product. My children say the food I cook tastes better than what I make, and they have tried both stir-fries and stews. The sugar-vinegar braised pork is particularly delicious. It takes a long time to cook, but other dishes only take a short time. The noise level is low, and I don't have to worry about making a mess or not being able to cook.
Received the goods, I couldn't wait to cook three dishes for lunch. It's really amazing how technology has changed our lives. The control of temperature and seasoning was precise, and the taste of the dishes was upgraded to a level of a master chef. It's a great tool for those who are not skilled in cooking. I highly recommend purchasing it. I have added a new member to my kitchen.
Intelligent cooking machine, the kind that automatically adjusts the heat and flips the food. No more fear of getting burned by hot oil or ruining the food by not controlling the heat properly.
The stir-fried dishes taste better than the ones I made, the stir-fried eggs with tomatoes are particularly flavorful, and the eggs have a great texture. This pan is a good value.
The goods are not bad, worth buying, very good overall, very clear, consistent with the description.
Worth having. Customer service is also very good.
The screen is large, clear, and not tiring on the eyes. So far, I haven't noticed any other abnormalities compared to mainstream displays, but it is thicker and the frame is slightly wider. The gap between the frame and the screen is a bit larger, but the screen display effect is not bad, and the accessories are complete.
The logistics speed is fast! The merchant's service attitude is good!
After using it for a while, the quality is quite good, and the screen resolution is also very clear. Trading stocks is very cool, only 1 yuan per share, it's too perfect.
The logistics are fast, the goods are good, the second item I bought is indeed good stuff. The display screen has high quality, not distorted due to the large screen, the interfaces are complete. The overall feeling is good, the colors are well restored, and the quality is excellent!

South African doctor: Although the Omicron variant of COVID-19 has a strong transmission rate, most cases are mild. Many South African doctors and medical experts believe that the symptoms caused by the Omicron variant are milder than those caused by the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report by the Associated Press, as the omicron variant of COVID-19 spreads in South Africa, a group of more than 5,000 doctors in South Africa's Gauteng province reported that the symptoms of the COVID-19 patients they are currently treating are relatively mild, such as body aches and coughing, which are similar to those of the flu. The organization's CEO, Dr. Unben Pillay, said he sees dozens of patients every day, but none of them have required hospitalization.
Dr. Fauci said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation." He said this includes elderly patients and those with health problems, who are more likely to develop severe illness from COVID-19 infection.
He said that compared to the previous wave of Delta variant, the COVID-19 patients he treated "had difficulty breathing, low blood oxygen levels. Many people had to be hospitalized within a few days."
After the first report of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in southern Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences in the following two weeks. Although it will take several weeks to collect enough data, the observations and early evidence provided by the doctors have given some clues.
According to a summary by the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa, in recent weeks, only 30% of COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized had severe illness, which is half the proportion of severe illness in the previous wave of the pandemic. The average hospital stay has shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days. Among recent COVID-19 patients, only 3% have died, while the death rate among early cases in South Africa reached 20%. William Hanekom, director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "Currently, almost all indications suggest that this is a milder disease."
He also said: "Currently, it is still in the early stage, and we need to obtain data from the later stage. Usually, the time of hospitalization and death occurs later, and we have only been in this wave of the epidemic for two weeks."
At the same time, scientists around the world are observing the number of cases and hospitalization rates, as well as testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods. Although Delta is still the main strain of the novel coronavirus worldwide, the Omikron strain is now appearing in dozens of countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to health officials, the number of new cases in Quebec increased by 400% in the first week of December, and testing showed that over 90% of the omicron variant cases were detected.

Yang Xiaodong lectured on the spirit of the 19th Sixth Plenary Session of the CPC Central Committee and the Provincial Party Congress, drawing inspiration from the CPC's century-long struggle.
On December 10th, the Hunan Daily reported (by journalist Gong Baowei) that, according to the unified arrangement of the provincial committee, on the morning of December 10th, Provincial Committee Standing Committee member and Provincial Committee Propaganda Department director Yang Haitao gave an interactive lecture at the Maolan Mountain Cultural and Creative Park, to deeply study and implement the spirit of the 19th CPC Central Committee's 6th Plenary Session, to study and implement the important speeches and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on important issues in Hunan, and to study and implement the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress. Yang Haitao explained the core principles and practical requirements of the conference from three aspects: ideal beliefs and missions, self-revolution and the great party of youth, and the leadership and theory of the party. He combined his own insights and personal experiences, explaining in a simple and systematic way the spirit of the conference.
He pointed out that it is necessary to combine the spirit of the whole conference with the important speech and instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping on the important speech of the Hubei Provincial Party Congress, and to study and implement the spirit of the two sessions. It is necessary to strengthen the self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness of "two establishments" and "two maintenances", and to move forward unswervingly along the direction guided by General Secretary Xi Jinping. During the interaction and exchange session, the representatives of grassroots cadres, enterprises, and young people asked questions about the relationship between the three historical resolutions, how to understand the decisive significance of "two establishments", how cultural enterprises should grasp the direction, and how young people in the new era can draw strength from the 100-year history of the party. Yang Hao East answered each question with plain language and vivid examples, and he earnestly hoped that young party members could draw strength from the 100-year history of the party's struggle, closely unite around the central party, and unswervingly follow the party

This information was obtained from a video conference on the employment and entrepreneurship work for 2022 college graduates held recently by the two departments.
The relevant person in charge of the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau stated that they will deploy the work of employing college graduates in Beijing from the aspects of strengthening supply and demand matching, strengthening policy support, broadening employment channels, ensuring assistance for the disadvantaged, supporting innovation and entrepreneurship, and improving service efficiency. It was learned that the Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau will set up a practical platform and actively contact 40 college graduate job experience bases, visit employers, and integrate demand and job information. They will focus on doing well in the "six first batches", namely expanding the recruitment of units, expanding the recruitment of state-owned enterprises, expanding the recruitment of basic-level projects, expanding the recruitment of those who apply for military service, expanding the recruitment of internships and employment, and expanding the recruitment of entrepreneurship-driven employment. They will implement "lifelong planning" dynamic management, recommending no less than 5 job information for each graduate, and ensuring that graduates
Actually, I don't know if it was a mistake by the store or the courier. There was no receipt in the bag.
I'm sorry, but I need more context to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide me with the full sentence or paragraph that this phrase appears in?
Because the delivery time is faster than the displayed 30 minutes, thank you.
Yes, he has already changed drivers and has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has been saying it's processing for several hours.
The photo has been taken and uploaded to you.
I know, but the restaurant doesn't know why they keep delaying the delivery time.
It turns out I didn't call #NUMBER# after all.
If I don't eat, I will definitely complain.
"你送不到，怎么不早点讲啊等你那么久" translates to "You can't send it, why didn't you tell me earlier? I've been waiting for you for so long."
No, I didn't receive the call. Please notify him to send it to our company.
I don't want to wait any longer.
A meal has been waiting for half an hour #PRS_ORG# and has not been delivered yet.
I want to cancel the order, why not give me the option to cancel?
Hello, the restaurant sent live chicken soup.
I want to try tennis, but I'm afraid I won't be able to stick with it, so I want to practice with a racket that's not too expensive first. Unfriendly, in fact, the price is often proportional to the level of friendliness. If you can't tell the difference, then a more expensive racket will be friendlier than a cheaper one, and this kind of "beginner racket" is actually industrial garbage.
They are very weak, when the ball hits the racket, the vibration is very big, even the professional players can't control it. Their existence is based on the logic of "badminton is so difficult, you can't learn it, and you don't want to buy expensive ones, so we cheat you with cheap ones. You will play twice and never play again. In this way, the racket is cheap, and you won't feel guilty."
When you can truly distinguish good from bad, it means you have progressed. Come back and buy from me then, and I'll make twice the profit. I suggest spending a similar amount of money to buy a used racket that's in good condition, such as a Prince or Dunlop. These two brands are not as well-known, so good rackets can't be sold for a high price. A new racket for 500 or 600 is already very good, and a used one for 200 is a bargain. Wouldn't you enjoy the experience of having a thousand-dollar racket for just 200 bucks?
The text translates to:  Friendly to newbies, but once you pass the newbie stage, it's all downhill from there. However, most people, especially women, can't get past the newbie stage.
"The order has been repeatedly delayed in terms of delivery time. May I ask for your assistance in following up on this matter?"
"推迟谢谢" translates to "Thank you for the delay" in English.
That is to say, I already have credit?
Next, do I need to place another order? Was the previous order no longer necessary?
Hello, I ordered some food from this restaurant, but the food that was delivered was missing a lot of items, and the chicken was also alive.
#PRS\_ORG# Without any reason, you accused me of self-pickup. Please cancel the order I placed, as I requested for delivery, and there was no self-pickup involved.
Jiangxi will train 10,000 rural elementary school music, art, and physical education teachers in the next three years - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 22 (Reporter Chen Yuxuan) Journalists recently learned from the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education that in order to strengthen the shortage of subject teachers and ensure the ability to implement compulsory education in rural areas, the province has planned to train 10,000 music, art, and physical education teachers for rural (township and below) primary schools in the next three years, starting from 2016.
According to the information, the target of this training is primary school teachers in Jiangxi Province who are under 45 years old and have a foundation or talent in music, art, and physical education. Through training, they will acquire basic knowledge and teaching skills in music, art, and physical education, update their teaching ideas and concepts, master modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability, and build a team of music, art, and physical education teachers who are proficient in multiple subjects. This aims to alleviate the problem of a shortage of music, art, and physical education teachers in rural areas.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training, Jiangxi plans to train 100 primary school music, art, and physical education teachers in each of the province's 100 counties (cities, districts), with a total of 3,000 trainees. The training aims to comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leadership ability, curriculum design and organization ability, teaching ability, and network research workshop construction ability, and play a teaching, demonstration, guidance, and supervision role.
Because we have already waited for 1 hour and #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want the food I made an hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous wrong order, but my car wheel cake is missing.
Hello, when will the ordered meal be delivered?
Your driver's phone number is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
Excuse me, can you provide a reasonable explanation? However, your driver has some issues. Please handle it properly.
Can you check if it's still on the way? If it can be delivered, that's fine. If it's really not, then refund the order payment.
In fact, there is a lot of emphasis on dressing for girls who are slightly overweight. For girls with heavier bodies, the length of their skirts should not be too short or too long, and the length should be around the knee, covering the fleshy part of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will expose the excess weight on the legs. If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you separate the upper, middle, and lower three sections, it will seem like you have naturally grown taller. Using different colors for the upper body, skirt, and long socks creates a sense of elongation. Actually, many dark-colored clothes are a must-have for chubby girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide excess weight, and a noble and elegant black mini-skirt is a top choice for chubby girls.
Wearing clothes in dark colors, especially black short skirts, can make you look slimmer. If you have fat legs, don't draw too much attention to your socks and shoes.
The more standardized, the better. Avoid using colors that are too vibrant to prevent people from noticing your legs and feet, which may give them the impression that you are overweight.
For girls who are a bit chubby, it's important to know some tricks about clothing coordination. Chubby girls should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and tops shouldn't be too short or stuffed into the skirt, which can make people feel uncomfortable. If you have thick legs, you should wear black opaque tights or grid tights (the kind with fine grids), and choose A-line skirts with printed patterns. Pair them with a blouse with a flared collar, which can effectively cover up the shortcomings of chubby girls.
Of course, even a chubby girl can be particular about wearing short skirts. When a chubby girl wears a short skirt, she should choose a top that matches the color of the skirt, which can make her figure look taller.
A short skirt paired with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the IN thing of the summer! If you are a bit heavier on top but have slender legs, I recommend choosing a fancy short skirt.
Not only can it cover your belly, but it can also showcase your advantages. An A-line skirt will look slimming, and is more suitable for chubby girls. When choosing a top, choose something that fits more tightly to create a sense of layering, which will make you look even slimmer.
Keep it simple with a plain white T-shirt and a mini skirt. Even plus-sized girls can try it and look fashionable.
As long as you can master the rules of dressing and styling, even girls who are slightly overweight can become the focus of everyone's attention. After making changes in dressing and styling, it's also important to exercise more in daily life and strive to break free from the label of being a "slightly overweight girl" as soon as possible. 😄

The performance is stable, and there are no problems with the four exhaust vents for heat dissipation. This model of Huawei Dark Knight gaming laptop is recommended. It is practical and reliable, and the brand is trustworthy.
In terms of the price of the ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Laptop, it is not considered expensive. Personally, I think the ASUS ROG Strix Gaming Laptop is really good. The gaming experience is comfortable, and it can handle most games smoothly. My FPS is stable, and the performance is very smooth. Even for games like LOL and CSGO, it performs well without any issues. Most 3A games can be played smoothly.
Cooling effect: The cooling effect is not bad, the fan provides good airflow, and the work is relatively quiet. The gaming effect with the fan open is still quite impressive. The appearance and materials are quite stylish, and the game's built-in fan display effect is also quite clear. The screen is very clear, and 1080p is sufficient for gaming.
I think buying a laptop is not bad at all, mainly used for design, with a high cost-performance ratio, lighter and better-looking than expected, the red on my butt is a nice color of wine, not as vulgar as imagined, overall exceeding my expectations, and worth the purchase, suitable for women as well. I started using HP Pavilion Dark Knight two years ago, and after using it for two years, the cost-performance ratio is still quite high, but the quality is too hard!
My friends around me also recommend them to buy this product! I have already purchased this series of 3 machines!
The appearance is beautiful and good-looking, and the configuration is also very suitable for my nephew to buy. I originally planned to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he needed it urgently, so I had to buy it earlier. Therefore, I missed the big bank activity and feel a bit regretful.
However, the cost-performance ratio is quite high, and the logistics are also quite fast. Let's come back and review it after a while. It's a new and original notebook computer with a very high cost-performance ratio. It has been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019, and the design style is quite good.
Display effect: bought a 3D rendering software for the child, the software is installed, the child says it can be used without problems, this computer is capable of 3D design work performance. Bought for the son, he said it was good.
The computer is pretty good, especially the customer service attitude is very good, they are patient with those who don't understand and are willing to help. It's recommended to purchase, and the graphics for playing games are quite good.
"Why are there 6 copies of a shrimp dumpling order when there is only one order?"
I can't go, I'm on delivery.
This hour, no one has contacted me. This is simply online fraud, making you think I'm calling for takeout for the first time?
After the investigation, you said the same thing! I checked the address several times before placing the order, and it was a good order, thank you! How many days was it?
From 7:00 to now 9:30, it hasn't been delivered yet. It's necessary to refund the deposit and cancel the order.
Claimed to have the loudest exhaust note in the new mountain district! This time, our team brings you a car that is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago - the Aventador LP700-4! Priced at over two million yuan, with an annual road tax of several thousand yuan, and four-wheel drive. Why is it called LP700?
With 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast that is? Even the author doesn't know, but the data shows that it can accelerate from 0-100km/h in just 2.9 seconds. That means by the time the author's Myvi reaches 30km/h, the other car has already reached 100km/h.
The low body, aggressive scissor doors, large air intakes on all sides of the body, and the glass-covered 6.5 v12 engine beneath - all of these perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini. There's no need to say too much about the car model's introduction; you can just Google it. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be covered by Google!
Too much attention, wherever you go, everyone is watching, feeling very uncomfortable! (Actually, it's kind of cool) 1km fuel costs around RM1 (the car owner doesn't care at all)
Practice your getting on and off the bus posture, otherwise it might be a bit embarrassing (because you won't be able to get out of the bus and get stuck halfway). The engine noise is too loud, and it may cause sudden tinnitus after getting off the bus (but it's still very refreshing).
The car body is too big, it will be quite narrow when parked in a regular parking space, and it's afraid of being knocked when the car next to it opens its door! A bit lonely on the road, because there is no opponent (the little editor said it herself, it has nothing to do with the car owner, haha).
Everyone, please don't misunderstand. The video of the super run was not for sale, sorry! If you have friends who want to shoot videos of their beloved cars, please feel free to contact us!
More car information that you don't know is hidden in The Car Guide / People's Car Encyclopedia, involving car accidents worth millions of dollars!
Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are well-known to car enthusiasts. Chiron is one of the most expensive supercars in the world, and the price of a Porsche 911 is also in the six-figure range! Recently, someone in foreign countries crashed a Porsche 911 and a Bugatti Chiron worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in just a few minutes!
The result proves that it makes sense!
I ordered a meal deal, but two items were delivered incorrectly.

Guangxi University Students' Leave of Absence for Entrepreneurship Can Reach Up to 5 Years - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Nanning May 19th (Reporter Zhang Ying) According to a recent report from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Education Department, from now on, universities in Guangxi will implement a flexible academic system, and the leave of absence for university students to engage in entrepreneurship can be extended from 2 to 5 years based on the original academic system. The time for students to take a leave of absence for entrepreneurship can be counted as practical education time.
In order to promote the innovation and entrepreneurship ability of college students, the Department of Education and the Department of Human and Social Affairs in Guangxi jointly established an entrepreneurship platform. They aim to build more off-campus practical teaching bases, university science and technology parks, university student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external support for college students' entrepreneurship. By 2020, the innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases for undergraduate schools should reach more than 30,000 square meters, and those for vocational schools should reach more than 20,000 square meters.
The government encourages universities to establish innovation and entrepreneurship majors and gives priority support to students with outstanding performance in innovation and entrepreneurship practice to transfer to the major. Teachers in universities should go to enterprises in the industry for at least two months every two years to sharpen their awareness and ability of innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The Autonomous Region Department of Education requires all universities in Guangxi to deeply implement the innovation and entrepreneurship training program for college students. The goal is to ensure that every college student participates in a innovation and entrepreneurship training program during their time in school. Universities are encouraged to actively organize students to participate in various levels of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions and provide financial support.

The full-visual wedding photography base (Hebei store) does not currently have branch wedding fashion avant-garde, makeup artists are also top-notch, shooting techniques and angles are professional, and the shooting effects are very good.
The seller has a very good reputation and the service attitude is also very good. The makeup is very exquisite and the team service is also very good. I had a very happy trip and the team is very professional. The seller's service attitude is very good and I will introduce it to my friends. I am very satisfied.
Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist, I have unique wedding dress photos. Thank you to all the staff who worked on taking our wedding photos today, looking forward to seeing the finished product.
Taking wedding photos is a physical activity, especially for the photographer who runs and jumps around. The makeup artist was very thoughtful and designed a makeup look that suited my face shape. During the photo shoot, the photographer captured some humorous and praiseworthy shots.
Thank you, my photographer and makeup artist, that I can look so beautiful even when I'm alive. Praise the bride, her eyes are beautiful, her appearance is generous and well-proportioned, just like a virtuous wife and mother. In the future, she will be thrifty and take care of her family.
The groom's calculation is correct, and he will have a happy and beautiful life. The quality of the wedding dress photos is not bad, just like what was said online, my beloved and I look handsome and beautiful in the photos, and we are very satisfied.
The seller's service attitude was also very enthusiastic. This time on the trip, not only admired the beautiful scenery, but also took beautiful wedding dress photos and even made friends with the photographer.
The wedding dress photos are so beautiful, blown up the photographer and makeup artist, you are really super super professional. Thank you sister Mu for your patient accompaniment and careful guidance, I love the photos you took~
When I saw the wedding dress photos, I suddenly didn't recognize myself. As long as the photographer chooses well, you can also have wedding photos that can rival those of celebrities.
The most important thing about taking wedding photos is that the photographer and makeup artist have aesthetics in common, luckily I found one. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "cheated" by the photos.
More than 130 Asian American organizations in the US submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, accusing three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - of discriminating against Asian American applicants in their admission process. (Source: Xinhua News Agency)
The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington the same day. The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian American applicants who meet the admission criteria of top American universities has increased many times, but the proportion of Asians in the three top American universities has remained at the same level.
Numerous studies have shown that these universities engage in systemic and persistent discrimination against Asian American applicants in the so-called "holistic" admissions process. Zhao Yusong introduced and said that the research by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asian Americans was the lowest among all racial groups in proportion to the number of applicants.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian-Americans in recruitment after determining the facts.
They also hope that the complained universities can actively pay attention to this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians. So far, the three universities that have been complained about have not responded.
The Asian American Educational Alliance was established in 2015. At that time, it complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's appeal also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.
The order for tableware has just been cancelled.
"Can you check if it has been canceled while it is still being executed?"

On the other side is the reservation hotline, they don't know what to say. Can you contact them directly with a phone call?
In September 2020, Mr. Lu learned about a factory in Yushan, Yongjia Town, Zhejiang through a real estate agent. After several on-site visits, Mr. Lu decided to purchase the factory. In December of the same year, Mr. Lu negotiated the details of purchasing the factory with the owner's family member, Lin Xi, and transferred 200,000 yuan to the bank as a deposit on the same day.
Mr. Lin signed as the recipient of the deposit on the "Factory Purchase and Sale Agreement," which stipulated, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within a week." However, due to disagreements on the scope of the factory for sale, payment methods, and other major contract terms, the parties were unable to form a unified opinion and the real estate purchase and sale contract was not signed for a long time.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach an agreement on the contract terms, a few days later, Mr. Lin refunded the 200,000 yuan deposit to Mr. Lu. After carefully selecting the house, paying the deposit, and preparing the down payment, all that was left was to sign the contract. However, the seller refused to sell, leaving Mr. Lu at a loss and angry.
For this reason, Mr. Lu filed a lawsuit against Mr. Lin to the Yuyang Municipal People's Court. The court held that since both parties failed to sign a formal contract, it cannot be solely attributed to the defendant, and it should be reasonably presumed that the negotiation failed. Therefore, this case should not apply the penalty of double compensation for breach of contract, and the defendant does not need to bear the responsibility of returning double the deposit.
After the first trial, the plaintiff appealed. Recently, the appellate court upheld the original judgment.
Lawyer's Reminder: It is necessary to exercise caution in the transaction process. As the buyer, you should exercise necessary caution when signing the contract, such as verifying the information of the owner of the property, whether the property is occupied by someone, and other relevant information, and clearly specifying the specific time and location of delivery in the contract to avoid disputes between the parties when performing the contract.
Okay, I'm afraid he might send the wrong address.

The taste is great, the meat is good, and the service is warm and friendly. It's been a while since I came to Daychang, and their fruit smoothies are still so delicious and made with real ingredients. I tried their pork chop sandwich for the first time, and it had the soft and smooth texture of southern flour that I love!
The clay pot rice was just right in terms of moisture, and the portion was very generous. The signature silicon paper-wrapped chicken wings were as delicious as ever, and the soup was also quite good. The broccoli was processed quite well, and the flavor was praiseworthy. The service was warm and friendly, and the meat dishes were tasty.
The old store of Rizhao has been a web celebrity for many years, located in a traditional courtyard building with wooden floors. You often have to wait a long time at the door to eat the clay pot rice, and the clay pots themselves are often cracked...
I haven't been to Daychang for several years, and the rise of various small Cantonese restaurants has dispersed the customer flow. It's rare to find a seat when you come to the restaurant, but the food quality is still as good as before.
The taste is praised, the meat is good, and the main dishes are recommended for takeout.
Rice: The meal was a bit disappointing this time. Three-cup chicken: The side dishes were a bit too much, and the chicken was a bit too little.
The main flavor of this dish is a bit off, the saltiness is not strong enough, so the sweetness is highlighted instead. You can all imagine adding sweetness and various spices to the dish...
What is the way to drink Red Card Whisky? Everyone's hobbies are different, some people like to collect, some people like to enjoy food, of course, there are also people who like to taste alcohol. Red Card Whisky is currently one of the best-selling Scottish whiskies in various countries, and it has also won a gold medal at an international spirits competition.
Every bottle of Johnnie Walker whisky has a unique taste, but if you don't know how to savor it, wouldn't that be a waste of its aroma? So, how do you drink Johnnie Walker whisky?
Here's a simple introduction to the "Red Card Whiskey Drinking Method" by our little editor:  The "Red Card Whiskey Drinking Method" is a unique way of enjoying whiskey that originated in Scotland. It involves using a red card, usually a playing card or a small piece of red cloth, to enhance the flavor and aroma of the whiskey.  To perform the Red Card Whiskey Drinking Method, follow these steps:  1. Pour a shot of whiskey into a glass. 2. Place the red card on top of the whiskey, making sure it covers the entire surface of the liquid. 3. Let the whiskey sit for a few minutes to allow the red card to infuse its flavor and aroma into the drink. 4. Remove the red card from the glass and discard it. 5. Carefully sip the whiskey, enjoying the enhanced flavor and aroma.  The Red Card Whiskey Drinking Method is said to bring out the full flavor and complexity of the whiskey, making it a popular choice among whiskey enthusiasts. Give it a try and see
Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch Whisky is made from a blend of about 35 Scottish whiskies, with a rich and traditional flavor of Scottish whisky, and a rich and fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness and smokiness. On the palate, it is rich and fresh, with hints of lavender and a strong smoky malt flavor.
This liquor can be directly added with ice to drink, or mixed with your favorite beverage to enjoy. Red Label Whiskey has entered the domestic market, in order to adapt to the taste of the Chinese people, Red Label Whiskey + Coca-Cola, Sprite, or other bubble drinks have become a timeless fashion trend.
These sweet drinks, in addition to being able to neutralize the sour taste, can visually bring pleasure to people, and when added to the drink, they have the effect of changing the taste of the drink. Red label whiskey + sliced grapefruit + granulated sugar (sugar can also be used), is the most authentic and traditional way of drinking.
The authentic red label whiskey has a slightly sour taste, adding sugar can neutralize its acidity, and lemon can bring a refreshing aroma to the drink. Of course, the sweet and sour taste can be adjusted according to personal taste preferences. The three methods mentioned above are the best ways to enjoy red label whiskey, and everyone can try them as a reference. I hope my introduction can help everyone.
If you can't change the store location for me, can you switch to delivery instead?

Madame Jin's Wedding Photography (Nanjie Store) temporarily does not have branch photography. Before the wedding photography, we did not arrange the time well, and we changed the time twice. Consultant Lanlan was very patient and helped us arrange the time.
Later, they chose a weekend with good weather to shoot. Mrs. Jin's staff, including consultants, makeup artists, and photographers, were all highly praised.
That was my first formal makeup, wow~ I can't believe it, I will also become that beautiful one day, hahaha. Xiaojie and another sister (sorry, I don't remember the name) were very patient with the makeup and the makeup looked very natural.
The outdoor scenes were filmed in Jiangwan City, fortunately the weather was very good and we didn't feel too cold during filming. The makeup artist would occasionally pay attention to our clothing and accessories, and would immediately help us tidy up if there was anything slightly off. The photographer was also very funny and we felt very happy after taking photos all day long.
When choosing photos, because we saw many cases online, we didn't want to let the client delete too many photos. But when we were choosing photos, there was absolutely no intention of us adding any photos. We just took the 24 photos that came with the package, and none of them were added (I heard that my sister, who took her wedding photos at the same time, had a package of over 7,000 yuan and added more than 1,000 photos. At that time, I was shocked and afraid that I would choose too many). Today, the photos are ready and Lan Lan sent them to me. I found two that I didn't like, and they immediately helped me re-edit them.
Take out the photos that my younger sister took before and compare them, I think we are really satisfied with our photos, they are simple and fresh, which is the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuanhan Lady Gold to take wedding dress photos!
Set price: 3999 yuan. Thank you, Madame, for your sincere wishes. May you be happy and prosperous, with a future as bright as brocade!
How much does this set cost?
What conditions must be met for $32 to be used?
Alright, no need to refund.

Your name is Zheng Meng, and this is your second week living in Japan. You are walking down the street when suddenly you notice someone following you. You become scared and start running faster and faster until you finally take off running.
The person behind you is calling out: "Miss! Wait! (Japanese dialogue throughout)" You stop at the convenience store entrance. "Miss... I am a director, I think you look very beautiful, would you be interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are very suspicious and afraid that this is a scam. He gives you a business card, and you find out that he is really a director of a large entertainment company in Japan.
"Miss, if you have time, we can go to the company to talk. The appearance fee is definitely not enough." You were stingy with your words and came to the company with him. He said he saw you on the street at a glance and hoped you could come and participate.
You thought about no loss and making money, so you signed the contract. This is a large-scale dating reality show, divided into two parts.
In the early stage, celebrities and ordinary people will interact in real life to develop a sense of camaraderie. In the later stage, they will enter the game together to complete missions.
Next week, the official recording will begin, and you don't know who your partner will be, what interesting things will happen?
So, how will the system handle that driver with the new order?
I think I can't accept the order if it takes more than 20 minutes to be delivered.
320 newborn babies in Sabah have no birth certificates due to counterfeit-proof paper shortage (Sabah, Malaysia, November 11, 2022) The National Registration Department of Sabah said that due to the stock of counterfeit-proof paper being exposed to light, they have been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since early October, affecting a total of 3,200 people so far.
However, the director of the Immigration Department, K. Arumugam, assured that the information of all infants who have applied for birth certificates has been recorded in the system, and the fake certificates will be replaced after the anti-counterfeit paper arrives next week. He explained in response to a news report by an online media outlet that the issue of counterfeit birth certificates in Sabah had persisted for up to 10 months.
He said the problem emerged two months ago, and Sarawak also faced the same issue. "One of the reasons is that a Chinese factory that produces custom anti-counterfeiting paper was affected by the epidemic, leading to a delay in delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used by the Sabah newspaper is different from other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other states' inventory. Kiru Amynius revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper arrived in Kuala Lumpur on the 6th of this month and was handed over to the printing company on the 8th for some printing work to be done.
"The department will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to place an order on Wednesday next week. After returning to Sabah, they will proceed with the final stage of printing. It is estimated that it will take two working days (December 20th) to deliver the documents to the applicants."  "We will notify the applicants to go to the respective branch offices to collect their admission papers."
He added that Sabah has issued a total of 24,801 admission papers so far this year.
From 7 o'clock in the morning until now, isn't it almost time?
I mean food.
I'm waiting across from #PRS\_ORG#.
Okay, thank you. The restaurant says they are ready.
Thank you, I will place the order again with points.
Where is the self-addressed location? I can't see the address.

Paying attention to Suining Easy Shopping service is very convenient, and it solves the trouble of my computer's hard drive being insufficient.

I will supplement the other functions later.
The appearance is quite good. As for the performance, I will evaluate it after using it for a while.
The machine is fast, much bigger than imagined, and the rendering effect is impressive. I like it, and I will follow up after a period of use to evaluate it. After searching in Hong Kong, I found the machine's serial number, and its quality should be satisfactory.
I feel that it's not big, but heavy. Actually, it's not very big when you can hold it with one hand, it's a bit bigger than a 15.6-inch one. When it's running, it's very stable, and I don't feel any lag. I like the sound of the fan dissipating heat. It's very responsive, and it doesn't spin around like a gaming laptop. It's much cheaper than the official flagship store, and it even comes with a backpack. I think it's pretty good.

Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation is very good, and the thickness is basically light. It is convenient to carry.

The seller carefully checks the appearance of the whole machine, all interfaces, and there are no signs of refurbishment or use. Indeed, it is a brand new machine with the same configuration and appearance.
Forgot to bring my backpack, but the seller quickly sent me a replacement backpack, although it wasn't the original factory backpack, the after-sales service proved that they are a sincere seller. If you need to buy a laptop, I would recommend this seller again.
Appearance material: appearance atmospheric, display effect: screen resolution can be, clear, thin degree: relatively has texture, after all, the heavier the object feels better. Heat dissipation effect: I have just tried it, and I will evaluate it later.
The typing on the keyboard is not bad, and they also sent a mouse and a converter. This configuration is quite cost-effective compared to domestic ones, and overall, the machine's performance is good. It would be better to evaluate its performance after using it for a while. The screen is really comfortable!
Translation: Smooth operation, will follow up with a review after some time!
Educational News: Beijing reduces the proportion of middle school special students in early 2016 - Xinhua News Agency, January 21st and 22nd. The examination for middle school special students in Beijing was organized and implemented by the education committees of each district.
This year, all districts in Beijing have reduced the admission rate for gifted students. The competition for gifted students has become more intense. For example, in Dongcheng District, the admission rate for gifted students in primary schools to junior high schools this year generally does not exceed 5% of the total planned enrollment of the district, with a planned enrollment of 380 students. The admission rate does not exceed 10% of the planned enrollment of the school.
Students who have talents in sports, arts, and technology and have registered online are eligible to participate in the special talent admission examination.

President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee: firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period - Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua News Agency reported from Sarajevo on December 11th. The President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, recently stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics and firmly believes that China has the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period.
Recently, China's ambassador to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Qi Ping, met with the President of the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee, Kvesić, at the Olympic Center in Sarajevo. During the meeting, Kvesić positively evaluated the China-Bosnia and Herzegovina relationship and expressed that he had a deep impression of China's excellent organization work during his visit to China during the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. He firmly believed that China had the ability to host a successful Winter Olympics in a special period. Bosnia and Herzegovina is looking forward to the Beijing Winter Olympics, and the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee is actively organizing for the event. Bosnia and Herzegovina hopes to use this as an opportunity to expand sports exchanges and cooperation with China.
Ji Ping stated that China and Poland have a special "Olympic silk belt". The 1984 Sarajevo Winter Olympics were successfully held here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will also open its curtains, presenting a simple, safe, and splendid event to the world.
We look forward to deepening the exchange and cooperation in winter sports events and athlete training between China and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Chinese Embassy in Bosnia and Herzegovina is willing to continue playing the role of a bridge, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as an opportunity to promote the continuous deepening of cultural exchanges between the two countries and let the two peoples move forward together. Before the meeting, the Bosnia and Herzegovina Olympic Committee held the "10th Annual Best Athlete Awards Ceremony", at which Tianqi was invited as a guest to present awards to the best young athletes in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The promotional video for the Beijing Winter Olympics is being looped on the event stage.

The State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism has issued a notice requiring people who have recently left land ports of entry cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) to present negative nucleic acid test certificates within 48 hours, and those entering land ports of entry cities to undergo at least one nucleic acid test after arrival. This measure aims to strengthen the epidemic control in port cities.
According to the notice, the time range for the above requirements is from the date of determining the port city scope and announcing it in each province, district, and city to March 15th, 2022. In addition, the notice also proposes that if conditions permit, port cities may study the establishment of epidemic prevention and control buffer zones within their jurisdiction.
The person in charge of the National Health and Health Commission's Disease Prevention and Control Bureau introduced that for some port cities, cross-border trade is a major economic support for the local area, and the exchanges between the two sides are frequent. By implementing a differentiated management policy based on regions, the single line of defense for epidemic prevention and control can become two lines of defense, which is expected to achieve the relocation of the port of entry, compress the risk of epidemic overflow, and achieve the maximum effect of epidemic prevention and control with the minimum social impact and lowest social cost.
Recently, there have been several local clustered outbreaks of COVID-19 in our country, all of which were imported from overseas through ports of entry in cities. The above-mentioned notice pointed out that this exposes some problems such as insufficient real-time monitoring and early warning of local epidemics, non-implementation of closed-loop management of high-risk personnel, formality of regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain items in all links, irregular management of centralized isolation sites, and inadequate scientific and precise emergency response to the epidemic.
Notice requires that efforts be made in nine areas, including improving the epidemic prevention and control system at the border port city, perfecting the epidemic monitoring and early warning system, and implementing border control measures, to strengthen the weak links in the port city's epidemic prevention and control work, without any relaxation, and to do the work of epidemic prevention and control in a scientific and accurate manner, to tighten the external prevention and control line. The notice emphasizes that all port cities should coordinate the epidemic prevention and control work with the work of ensuring people's livelihood, publicize and open up the hotline for people's livelihood protection, and regularly investigate and solve the hidden dangers in the supply of basic living materials and prices, and actively respond to the prominent problems reflected by the masses.
According to the notice, the coastal cities referred to include those with open land, water, and air ports located in counties (cities, districts, banners), municipalities (prefectures, cities, autonomous regions), and directly administered municipalities, with the specific scope to be determined and announced by each province (autonomous region, directly administered municipality) based on epidemic prevention and control needs.

Oil pipe video reveals 20-year US military obsession with bloodshed and slaughter - Xinhua News Agency (video source: Bilibili)
On December 11th, a micro-documentary titled "Killing Machine" on the oil man platform caused widespread attention. The film tells the story of how the United States launched the war in Afghanistan under the pretext of "anti-terrorism" and forcibly exported American-style democracy. After 20 years of fighting, the soldiers became poor, violent, and bloodthirsty, and committed numerous crimes against humanity.
Abusing drones to launch attacks on hospitals, schools, and other civilian facilities, distorting human nature, and forming a killing group. Over the past 20 years, American forces have killed tens of thousands of innocent Afghan civilians.
The US military has set up "black prisons" where "suspects" are subjected to various forms of torture and physical humiliation. One atrocity after another has sparked more hatred among the Afghan people.
As the video said, the US "anti-terrorism" war has become more and more terroristic. The war has not brought the Afghan people peace, democracy, and prosperity, but only brought a country full of scars and countless killings and destructions.
Watch the video with me and let's uncover the truth behind America's so-called "anti-terrorism" actions that involve bloodshed and slaughter. Let's expose the hypocrisy and false facade of American-style democracy!
The food arrived late, and it had all cooled down. After it had cooled down, it became dry and hard, and there was no way to eat it, and the soup had also spilled out.

How to give payment to the driver for the service fee?
An hour or more ago, it was confirmed that a driver was unwilling to wait any longer.
Don't scare people at the starting line - When browsing bookstores, you can often feel the popularity of success-oriented books.
Many successful self-help books today emphasize the "best principle" - that is, they first assume or imply that you can "do it," then tell you what you need to do. In other words, they skip over the most important and fundamental step of "how to do it."
Therefore, these books all have a common characteristic - they either go all out and do their best, or they don't do anything at all; they're either a 100, or they're a 0; they either make it to the top of the mountain, or they stay put where they are. This "do your best principle" makes everyone who sees it admit that it's "extremely correct," but 99% of people are intimidated before they even start.
Because this theory advocates a path of "you must make a decisive decision to transform yourself and undergo a 180-degree change," which happens to be the Achilles' heel of many people. For those who are conservative, stick to the old ways, and refuse to change, you will definitely shout loudly in their ears "you must transform," which is undoubtedly self-deception and a futile gesture.
Most people will feel fearful and hesitant before the word "transformation," taking small steps and finding it difficult to make a decision. Alternatively, they may impulsively make a decision to undergo "transformation" and boldly take the first step, but this is often short-lived, and they quickly lose momentum and fail to see the sustainability in it. Mr. Ma Sanli's famous monologue "Starting from Tomorrow" perfectly illustrates this "universal human nature."
The biggest problem with the "best principle" is that the threshold is too high, it often exceeds the limit of ordinary people's abilities, making the vast majority of people "despair and sigh." Perhaps, the "second-best principle" is a way that may allow more ordinary people to achieve relatively successful paths.
The core principle of "次好原则" is "lowering the threshold" - it encourages a theory of "accumulating small victories to achieve great victories", that is, if you can't do 100%, doing 1% is still okay: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing the small sand dune in front of your house is also okay, because that is still better than walking on the ground. In short, as long as you do something, it is always better than doing nothing.
Due to the significant reduction in the threshold, it is now possible for ordinary people to persevere, and with perseverance, the chances of success will increase. However, following the path to success by adhering to the "80% principle" may take a slightly longer journey.
In summary, the "best principle" may wave the banner of making everyone successful on the surface, but in reality, it can effectively motivate only a few people. On the other hand, the "second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and benefit as many people as possible.
Do I need to place a new order now?
The phone has been ringing unanswered for a long time, causing delays.
Haven't you sent it yet? When will you send it?
How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He missed two meals, but there is an order that has been completed. I want to ask how to contact the driver.
The first driver just told me that there should be another driver coming.
Qinghai Lake naked carp resources increase by 7,100 tons this year - Xinhua News Agency Xinhua News Agency Xining, December 11 (Reporters Luo Xiaofei, Zhang Hongxiang) According to the latest monitoring results, the naked carp resources in Qinghai Lake have increased by 7,100 tons this year compared to last year, reaching 108,500 tons. Compared with the initial protection in 2002, the cumulative increase has exceeded 40 times. The news was learned from the Qinghai Provincial Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department.
The naked carp, also known as the "Yan fish" in the local dialect, is a valuable fish species found only in Qinghai Lake. It plays a crucial role in maintaining the "water-fish-bird" ecological chain and biodiversity in the Qinghai Lake basin. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human over-fishing and deterioration of the breeding environment, the population of naked carp in Qinghai Lake sharply declined, and by 2002, the reserve of naked carp in Qinghai Lake had decreased to only 2,592 tons.
In 2004, the naked carp in Qinghai Lake was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a ban on fishing in the lake, prohibiting any unit, collective, or individual from catching naked carp in Qinghai Lake and its main rivers and tributaries, as well as banning the sale of naked carp and its products.
At the same time, through artificial propagation and cleaning up the main river channels of the rivers flowing into Qinghai Lake, as well as designing scientific and reasonable "fish passages", the province has continuously increased its efforts to protect the Qinghai Lake naked carp resources. The deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Department of Qinghai Province, Yang Lin, introduced that as of now, a total of 1.8 billion naked carp have been artificially propagated and released into Qinghai Lake, contributing to the recovery rate of the Qinghai Lake naked carp resources exceeding 23%.
The Qinghai Sanjiangyuan area is an important ecological barrier and water source nurturing zone not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function zone that controls the spread of western desertification to the east. To protect the ecological environment of the Sanjiangyuan area and the water area of Qinghai Lake, to protect aquatic wildlife, and to maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, Qinghai has successively issued bans on fishing in key water bodies of the Yangtze River, the Huanghe River, and Qinghai Lake, building a comprehensive ban on fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, and I had to put it in the bag, even though the weather was cold.
Excuse me, is the takeout delivered in a bag? We only see one bag.
I want to know if it was leaked or if someone from our team took it, thanks.
It's been 1 hour already, but it hasn't been delivered yet.
Today is the Winter Solstice festival, and ordering the wrong dish for the little ones can be quite disappointing.
I hope the store can check the quality of the goods even in a busy situation.
Taking a foot bath and getting an electric shock? Choosing the right foot bath can have excellent therapeutic and health effects. Today, the editor of Guomei will answer this question and hope to help friends.
With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred dollars to thousands of dollars, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. In terms of related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot bath basins and other health-related household appliances are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, which poses certain safety risks.
"Swimming in electric water is too dangerous, right?" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet. Mr. Li tried using a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conducting electricity.
Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath basin was returned, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied. Because he found that this popular foot bath basin for a long time had no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of applicable temperature range, target population, and material safety guarantees.
However, generally speaking, a foot bath basin will not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during production. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a foot bath basin with a separate power supply.
Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard. You can test it with an electric pen at will.
The 13th Provincial Tea Expo Opens - Headlines - Hunan Daily - huasong.hunan.gov.cn - Hunan Daily December 10th news (full media reporters: Zhang Changwu, Hu Lanlan, correspondent: Liu Xiaoling, photographer: Li Jian) This morning, the 13th Hunan Tea Industry Expo and New Tea Product Launch Conference was held at the Hunan International Expo Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovating tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the goal of a trillion-dollar tea industry.
The Vice Chairman of the All-China Wholesale and Retail Cooperative Society, Huo Shunli, and the Vice Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhen, attended the opening ceremony. At the opening ceremony, Professor Liu Zhonghua, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, solemnly introduced the source of the "Lake Red" and the rise of red tea as "Five-Color Tea" to inject new impetus into "Lake Red".
In recent years, the Provincial Committee and Provincial Government have strongly supported the development of the tea industry, promoting the construction of the "Chen Yi Tea Industry" with a total investment of 100 billion yuan, forming a development pattern of "Three Chens, Four Waters, and Five Color Teas". The tea industry in the province has increased innovation, with main tea varieties such as green tea, black tea, and red tea taking turns to launch, and the main tea-producing areas promoting the integration of tea tourism, driving a significant increase in income for tea farmers.
The winds of fortune shift, and red tea is making a comeback. Provincial tea experts say that after harvesting green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea gardens is on the rise.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leaders presented certificates to the fourth batch of enterprises authorized to use the "Lake Nan Red Tea" trademark and welcomed them to the "Lake Red Source". A tea merchant from Fujian saw a high mountain tea named "Ice in Spring" and placed an order on the spot at the New Red Tea Museum.
The secretary-general of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Jun, said with excitement, "Currently, the epidemic and other factors have had an impact on the tea market, but from the tea expo, we can see that there are many highlights. The new red tea adds a touch of red, injecting tea culture, and is popular with high transaction volume. The tea industry in Hunan is welcoming the new spring with enthusiasm."
If these foods are not hot, can they be canceled? I don't want them anymore, because there's no way to stop the car below, so he couldn't deliver them.

Time Capsule Photography has not yet established branch stores and member reviews.
[Effect] Photo effects: I took two outfits in total. Overall, I quite like the photos from this set.  [Service] Service details: Due to my pregnancy, I felt a bit uncomfortable during makeup. The makeup artist and staff were very considerate and let me rest for a while. They also kept giving me cold water to drink.
Set price: 1000 yuan Thank you for the rabbit's evaluation. Originally, I said I would refuse the ancient style, but I didn't expect the finished product to be so beautiful.
Thank you, Dandan, for your recognition. Your satisfaction can give us the energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend it to all of you!
No matter whether it's reception, makeup, clothing, lighting, or photography, everything is flawless. The makeup artist is particularly skilled and will match your style to create a makeup look that suits you, using only top-tier brands.
Mr. Tian is right, photography is indeed a profession. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two little kittens to play with.
We are working in Beijing, and the popular movie theaters in Beijing require queuing up half a year in advance. My colleagues have taken pictures there, and after watching the finished product, they thought it was just so-so. I specifically sought out this studio because it is a place with soul and attitude.
Our facial expression management is quite poor, and we feel that this is also the case for most people. Brother Liang, the photographer, will capture and record the natural and splendid moments. The makeup artist, the photographer, the post-production design team, a top-notch team.
When the film was released, we and the people around us all praised it to the skies. I have already recommended it to my girlfriend, and she was equally delighted after watching it.
I hope this kind of studio won't be buried and more people can discover TA and create their own unique style instead of being uniform. Thank you very much for the five-star reviews from Jinxing and Qingling. Both of them are very creative and innovative young people, and we are a creative studio. As long as the client likes us, we will put in 200% effort to complete the project. Thank you for meeting each other.
A sweet and considerate assistant, as well as a lively and cheerful photography teacher, every member of the team was super nice and had a wonderful shooting experience that was hard to forget. The results of the shooting were even better than I had imagined. Thank you all for your hard work! 😘😘 Thank you for your comments, Little Universe. It's a kind of fate to get to know you. The trust you have in us is a journey of thousands of kilometers from Hohhot to Qinhuangdao. I'm happy to meet you all, and I hope to have the opportunity to come to Qinhuangdao again to play.

However, if you plan to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is an even better choice for them. If you have strong self-discipline, you can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. Firstly, you should look at the institution's faculty strength. If the faculty strength is not strong enough, the training institution would be meaningless. Of course, some newly-established training institutions may not have particularly strong faculty strength.
Secondly, before making a decision, it's a good idea to investigate this training institution. It's best to investigate the students who have graduated from this institution because only the students of the institution know how good or bad the courses are. Actually, I don't know how to answer your question because you haven't introduced your own situation, and learning this thing is closely related to your personal circumstances.
For example, factors such as profession, age, and the language you want to learn may be related to the industry you want to pursue. If you are a student who has not yet graduated or a computer major who has already graduated, in my personal opinion, if you have enough time, I would recommend self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are also many offline and online training institutions that are quite good, but the cost of learning is high, and the time investment is relatively large, usually requiring concentrated training for 3-6 months.
However, if it's about the situations I mentioned, self-study is quite convenient now, as there are many free learning resources available online, or you can find training resources on Bilibili. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me for free resources or detailed consultations. Additionally, there are some classic books that can be studied comprehensively with videos.
If you are not a computer professional but are willing to pay a certain amount of study fees and time costs, it is recommended to go to a training institution for learning. This way of learning does not have to be very tiring, and the teachers will explain in detail. If you have any questions, there will be people dedicated to answering them. In addition, training institutions can also provide assistance in study planning or supervision. Moreover, nowadays many training institutions will sign employment agreements, have internal referral quotas, and recommend going to companies after studying, which can save a lot of trouble in the later job interview stage.
Here are my views, as mentioned earlier, due to not knowing your situation, I only gave a general introduction and did not go into detail. If you have any other questions you would like to consult on, feel free to contact me for communication and discussion at any time.
I arrived at 1 point before. I saw it in the app.
What do you mean, you haven't finished speaking yet, what are you doing?
I, undertake various (installation, cleaning, maintenance), wall-hung boilers, water heaters, washing machines, air conditioners, toilets, stoves, oil fumes, lighting fixtures, glass wiping, professional sewing, home service.

Life is like this, others only see the results, but we have to go through the process alone. When facing life, we are not only strong, but we also continue. There is no other choice. The road can be turned back to look at, but it cannot be turned back to walk on.
Cleaning is both a job and a responsibility. Life becomes beautiful because of service, and service becomes exquisite because of sincerity. Although cleaning may be the dirtiest job we do, we approach it with the most serious attitude, carefully cleaning every corner of our clients' homes until they smile with satisfaction and raise their thumbs up.

"Bǎo wàn jiā jìng, shù jiā zhèng duì bēi, fú wù dào wèi, jìng jìng dào jiā. Shì nèi wài bǎo chǎng, wǒ de rì cháng gōng zuò."
Although the crystal lamp is magnificent, if it is not cleaned for a long time, it will become dull and without light. Only after cleaning can it shine brightly. Similarly, in life, success can only be achieved by putting in the effort and paying attention to the details. By being meticulous and refined, we can create beauty. We are serious about this.
"Give me a chance, I guarantee you'll be satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting, and your recognition is my biggest motivation! There's no denying that the current job market is tough!"
But I always believe that as long as you have a sincere attitude, perseverance, and hard work, you will be better than others, at least you will be stronger than those who just sit and complain. "A day's plan starts in the morning, and all the beauty begins with the dawn." I hope you start the new day with happiness, luck, health, and satisfaction. Stay in a good mood all day long. Good morning!
When we were young, happiness was something we had; when we grew up, happiness became a goal to be achieved; and when we became mature, we realized that happiness was actually a state of mind, and by understanding this, we could find happiness. Be the truest, kindest version of yourself, follow your heart, and live a fulfilling life without regrets. Life is a journey, walk your own path. The two treasures of life are good health and a good mood, live happily and beautifully until old age!
In every stage of life, you will encounter different challenges. Often, what holds you back is not your ability, but the courage to face them positively.
Since you can't avoid it, you might as well face it head-on. The more you're afraid, the more difficult it will be to overcome; but if you confront the challenge, the problem will eventually be resolved.
Chinese to English translation:  Curators from China and Saudi Arabia join forces to hold the first Saudi Contemporary Art Biennale in Diriyah - Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua News Agency, December 12, 2022 (Reporters: Wang Hai Zhou, Hu Jun) The first Diriyah Contemporary Art Biennale in Saudi Arabia - the Diriyah JAX Art District, was officially opened to the public on the 11th in the Diriyah Contemporary Art District located in the northwest of the Saudi capital Riyadh. A total of 64 artists from Saudi Arabia and China participated in the exhibition.
The biannual exhibition this time is co-curated by the Saudi Diriyah Biennale Foundation and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China. The director of the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in China, Yang Feng, serves as the artistic director. According to the curatorial team, the theme of this biennale is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which metaphorically represents the reform strategies adopted during the social and economic transformation period, as well as reflecting the current state of social and cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
This year's biannual exhibition covers an area of nearly 12,000 square meters, with exhibition halls spanning six interconnected buildings, presenting six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River", "Inheritance as Experiment", "Edge Thinking", "Towards the Public", "Beautiful New World", and "On the Spirit of Art". Among them, the works of 27 Saudi Arabian artists account for more than 40% of the total number of exhibits, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; the works of 12 Chinese artists are also highly regarded, with some artists using innovative ways to create with recycled materials, such as Xu Bing's "Behind the Story Series: Endless Mountains and Rivers" (2014), where he reconstructed a classic landscape painting using discarded materials.
Diriyah Biennale Foundation CEO Bakri said he hoped this year's biennale could establish an international dialogue, giving global audiences the opportunity to understand Saudi Arabia's vibrant cultural and creative industries and creative communities, and enhancing interaction. Tian Feiyu said: "The goal of the biennale is dual, on the one hand, it allows Saudi contemporary art to participate in the global dialogue, and on the other hand, it allows Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the world of contemporary art."
According to the information, a series of lectures will be held during the opening period of the biennale, in which artists, curators, and opinion leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural exchange and the development of contemporary art.
I ordered an axe and a cleaver from the restaurant, and they told me that the delivery rider cannot deliver bones.
I want to understand why the bones can be called a restaurant and packaged separately for delivery.
However, the system is not very convenient, it is still using another room.
I am at #ADDRESS#, in the Mei Xin Li branch which is quite far away from me.

Yunnan: Unify and standardize the management of public welfare positions in rural areas-Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua Net, Kunming, December 12 (Reporter Lin Bi Feng) In order to continue to do a good job in helping poverty-stricken populations find employment and consolidate and expand the results of poverty alleviation, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in rural areas, to assist in the comprehensive promotion of rural revitalization.
The person in charge of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Civil Affairs introduced that at present, Yunnan has developed 448,300 rural public welfare positions for the employment of poverty-stricken laborers and other disadvantaged rural groups, which play an important role in helping poverty-stricken groups achieve employment income, consolidate poverty alleviation achievements, and effectively improve the ability of rural public services in various aspects. This new regulation is jointly issued by the Yunnan Civil Affairs, Rural Revitalization, Finance, and other seven departments, and mainly standardizes the scope of recruitment subjects, financial management, position development, and position management for the recruitment of personnel for rural public welfare positions at the grassroots level.
In terms of on-the-job development arrangements, the new regulations clearly stipulate that they should be carried out according to the principles of "needs-based positioning, on-the-job determination, dynamic management, and overall quantity control" and the principles of "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible" as well as "one person, one post, voluntary publicity, and unified management." The recruitment process must be carried out in accordance with the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-job training, and on-the-job arrangement.
In addition, the new regulations also clearly stipulate the specific responsibilities of the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods for subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and require the relevant departments to supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions. The regulations also stipulate that the main departments for the development of rural public welfare positions should purchase commercial insurance for accidental injuries for the personnel in rural public welfare positions, and require relevant departments to regularly supervise the subsidy distribution for rural public welfare positions.
Wrong address, how are you?
Can I cancel the order and place a new one?

Although the rightists had a period of triumph in history, it was not long-lasting. They flourished when they received a bit of sunshine and sweated when they drank some water. As soon as they achieved their goals, they became arrogant and overconfident, and then suffered setbacks. However, when it comes to seeking the truth and promoting social progress, the rightists have played a positive role.
From defining the truth standard after the end of the Cultural Revolution to promoting economic development, technological advancement, and political institutionalization and human rights protection, the positive significance of the rightists should not be denied. Three, as for me, although I do not fully agree with some of Li Weidong's views, I am interested in his views and respect him as a person; because he is serious, he is serious about China, and he takes China's social issues seriously.
But I oppose his anti-Communist theory. I believe that resistance is necessary, but revolution will inevitably lead to social upheaval, damage to people's livelihoods, and a chaotic mixture of political groups. Then, foreign powers will take advantage of the situation. Fourthly, to change or improve China requires patience and a responsible attitude for the country and the people. Those who engage in political speculation and attempt to reap benefits from chaos are not rightists, but scoundrels.
Let's talk about the left again. The left, in fact, is a group of orphans of their time and politics.
If we say that the right has a positive significance for society, the Communist Party will listen to some right-wing speeches and analyze their ideas when necessary. However, the left does not have this kind of thinking, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party throws away! Recently, I have seen some friends who are angry at both traitors and the left, and they are full of energy. I think it is not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists, it's a lost cause. It's pointless to try to prove that we're right or to try to convince the counter-revolutionaries and leftists. Why bother?
I tell my friends: When the counter-revolutionaries curse you for five mao and the leftists curse you as a right dog, it just proves that our middle way is the right way! Many people have ideals when they are young, but forget them or become obsessed with them as they get older.
As the ideal recedes further and further, even the young dragon slayer eventually becomes an evil dragon. I feel that the concept of "left and right" generally refers to restraint and freedom, and due to China's inherent genetic predisposition from its historical and cultural background, China as a whole tends to lean towards the left.
Internally, the right wing emphasizes efficiency and development, while the left wing strengthens regulation and places greater emphasis on fairness and safety. Now, society as a whole hopes to place more emphasis on fairness, and it is certain that the left wing will prevail in the ongoing struggle between China and the United States. It is estimated that this trend will continue for many years to come.
Although I can't understand it, I'll just give it a thumbs up since it's such a chivalrous act.
It's been 2 hours since I placed the order at 19:06 😅
Today, let's take a look at some "strange hot searches." What is considered normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot topics: February 2nd dragon raises its head, Klar raises prices, and the event of goods being transported by trucks. The public opinion spreads and forms a wave peak, and then the index drops (a smooth curve) and finally dissipates. If there is a secondary wave of public opinion, there will be a small hump that reappears. They look exactly like the "Internet Public Opinion Evolution Model" that was once displayed on the official website of the Cyberspace Administration.
What is abnormal public opinion? Randomly selecting the same event and presenting six hot searches in the form of a peak, sawtooth, and cliff.
[Peak shape] refers to human-induced heating, quickly climbing the hot search rankings and attracting public attention; [Sawtooth shape] refers to periodic heating, ensuring that the topic remains on the hot search rankings; [Cliff shape] refers to collective withdrawal, indicating that the hot search has fulfilled its "function" and is ready to take on a new task and move to a new battlefield. In Figure 9, the peak of heat for one event coincides with the trough of another event, the time difference is only a few seconds, indicating that the unified water army has been assigned a new task and launched a new round of attacks.
The professionalization of black PR is evident in its diversity: dozens of trending topics appear on the list, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for popular science, which ones lead the trend, which ones divert attention, which ones influence cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones stimulate emotions, which ones manipulate decision-making, black PR accounts are divided into batches and targeted at different nodes, almost considering all the elements of the spread of public opinion. Spreading is a science, putting aside subjective factors such as stance and emotions, black PR will be nowhere to be found when it comes to objective data.
Wherever you go, you will leave a trace. Let's dig out these traces together. Data source: Time Machine.
Mauritius and other countries have reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus - Xinhua News Agency, Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 12th. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency's overseas correspondents, Mauritius, Cyprus, and Malawi have recently reported their first cases of infection with the Omicron strain of the novel coronavirus.
Mauritius reported its first two cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 on December 10th. According to the Mauritian Minister of Health, Kailesh Jagutpal, one of the infected individuals is a tourist who arrived in Mauritius on November 27th after traveling from South Africa. The other infected individual is a local resident who came into contact with someone who had recently traveled to South Africa and returned to Mauritius. He tested positive for the virus on November 30th after undergoing a nucleic acid test.
After being treated in isolation at the hospital, both infected individuals tested negative for the virus. They have now returned to their respective homes. The Cyprus Health Department announced on the 10th that the country has reported its first three cases of Omicron variant infections.
These 3 people are all students and returned from overseas travel at the beginning of this month. Since they all had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization for treatment, in order to prevent the spread of the Omicron strain of COVID-19, the government of Xi'an has been continuously strengthening its prevention and control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th of next year, all passengers over the age of 12 who enter the country by plane will need to pay for a nucleic acid test after arriving at the airport. On the 10th, the Health Commission also announced that it will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 and 11 with the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine.
Malawi Health Minister Khumbize Kumwembe said on the 9th that the country has detected its first three cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. The country's health department conducted gene sequencing on 12 COVID-19 positive samples collected from November 9th to December 2nd and found these three infection cases.
The phone number provided by the delivery rider for the takeout order was fake.
"Will I get a refund if I reorder the same item?"
If it can't be done, please cancel the order and get a refund.
Thinking of calling for breakfast early and eating early, but now it's 7 o'clock and I haven't eaten yet.
I don't understand what you're saying... is your Chinese translated or do you prefer to use English?
Should I call him to deliver that message?

I don't think this will be of any help!
The order for the stomach is Phoenix Claws.
Sure, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER#. Do you want me to leave it in the conversation?
I explained to your staff on the phone.
Your driver told me that the address is too far.
Da Mei 360 Home Decoration Store Address: No.156, Huan Cheng Nan Lu, Xing Fu Garden, 12th Floor.
At the beginning, it was introduced by a friend because of trust, so I chose to come and take a look at the initial budget of 70,000 yuan for basic decoration. As soon as I arrived at the store, a series of tricks began.
I went to the store for the first time just to show them my house plan, they didn't even go to the site to measure the house, yet they could give me a quote saying my 135 square meter house could be done for 70,000 yuan. They roughly looked at their materials, and didn't even know what brand they were. Their second trick is to get you to pay the deposit as soon as you come to the store (and once you pay, you can never get it back unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
When I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, they would invite their so-called manager to tell you that if you pay the deposit today, we can give you a certain amount of discount. This is a big trap, and I was cheated alive and well. When I was impulsive, I paid more than 10,000 yuan of deposit.
He gave me a quote with many problems, 70,000 yuan does not include water and electricity renovation, does not include any doors and cabinets for the bathroom, and these three are the basic costs. In addition to these, their service charges are also higher than other companies.
I have lost trust in this company. They didn't explain anything clearly at the beginning and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for a refund, they acted very experienced and had a special team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it ends up, it's the customer's problem and they are completely blameless. There are various ways to shift responsibility, and there are many details that I don't want to go into here - it's all just tears. In short, don't choose them, because my friend's house that they did renovations on also had poor quality, and they ended up charging various fees in the end.
Crater, they are originally the decorative leaders of the swindlers, now changed to become beautiful, as if they have gone bankrupt and transformed into something else. So everyone don't choose such crater decoration companies.
In the future, when everyone is choosing, please check these consultations several times on Baidu. Decorating is not cheap. If you want to ask the merchant, please log in or register first.
Strictly prohibit the publication of various forms of merchant reviews, please see the merchant's statement for details. The Chongqing Decoration Design Channel provides you with the latest merchant information, including address, phone number, and business hours. Find a decoration company by browsing the public reviews on the platform.
So terrifying, if it takes less than 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other way? For example, changing the address?
Alright, don't cancel this conversation. If I don't get my refund within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely pursue it.
I asked if it could be canceled within 15 minutes.
"Kǒu shuǐ jī yīng xū de, dàn shōu huò de shēng ròu, méi bāng fāng chī"  This should be translated as: "The mouth-watering chicken should be cooked, but what I received was raw meat, I can't eat it."
It's been 3 days without a response... Because your system cannot recognize my credit card, I cannot join the #PRS\_ORG# monthly subscription plan! What's even stranger is that I always use the same credit card to pay.
"Can I be exempted from the shipping fee every time and have you collect my monthly fee after the investigation? Is this okay?"
How can I contact the delivery person?
It's almost 3 o'clock now, isn't it time for me to get my compensation?
I said to deliver the goods by knocking on the door, but the driver just left them at the door and then left.
I'm sorry, but the text you provided is incomplete and doesn't make sense in Chinese. Could you please provide me with the full text or context so I can better understand what you're trying to communicate?
Your driver has already picked up an order for you at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling me to wait as the driver received my order at 19:25 but still refuses to leave.
After I finish buying, what should I do if I want to order other things?
Where has your driver gone, do you still need to wait?
I will send the package, if you don't cancel, I will report to the police.
But my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

Good governance and good rule of law - "20th Anniversary Edition of the Lecture Series on the Historical Experience and Culture of Senior Leaders and Civil Servants" by 14 historical masters, cultural celebrities, and renowned scholars, including Wang Chunyu, Zhang Dake, Xiong Chaozhong, Jia Jianxun, and Deng Xiaonan, for senior leaders and civil servants.
Here's the English translation of the text:  "The promotional code has been redeemed, there's no problem. You don't need to arrange for a resend, I've purchased it separately and don't want to waste it."
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insults, and I cannot accept such behavior of personal attacks. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must eliminate this kind of scoundrel.
If you don't look at political parties and factions, the first thing to resist is this uncivilized behavior. From the moment you started sending friend requests on QQ and posting provocative posts, to your attempt to publish so-called "my home address and father's name" on social media, I have already adopted a non-response attitude.
After you left, you became more diligent and didn't just stick to the frequency of one meal a day, tagging me. You also continued to discuss some ambiguous, derogatory comments about me with your so-called friends on Facebook without any restraint, such as my appearance, figure, good upbringing, and whether to insert something in bed. I... I've counted that too. Later, I received more photos of you from several friends on Facebook with sexual harassment comments.
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After the news of my reporting was uploaded, you did not calm down at all, but became even more arrogant.
I don't care about your political background, and I don't care about your identity or status in society. In our society, mutual respect between genders is necessary. Yes, you can continue to engage in sarcastic, ambiguous, humiliating, and insulting speech. You can also continue to say that you only care about and are concerned about me. You can continue to believe that this is not harassment, and you can even deny that the images were not made by you or continue to publish attacking speech.
No, I can't, and I don't have the ability to stop you. I don't know you and I don't want to know you, my appearance and figure don't need you to comment on them.
I don't even think that any girl would be willing to let others humiliate her like this for the sake of fame. My friend asked me, is it okay?
I said it would be fine, but you wouldn't believe me. I don't think any girl could say she's okay after being bullied like that.
Regardless of whether it is in the workplace, society, politics, or the business world, only those who lack even the most basic moral character would choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice resides in the hearts of people.
I captured some comments for everyone to evaluate your own post that you sent. Shouldn't anyone be able to impersonate you anymore?
I can only say that you are an enemy of civilization and I will laugh at your heart.
I have reported and attached a photo, but have not received a response.
What kind of cow, no cow is chicken soup, fresh meat.
"没办法吃" can be translated to "No way to eat" in English.
Are you sure it's freshly cooked food, not old?
"It's too late, I've already placed an order."
"Why do we need to remake it if it arrives at 7:00 AM?"
"太离谱了" can be translated to "Too out of tune" in English.
"Zhihui Xiangxi" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit Opens - Rolling News - Hunan Daily - Voice of China Online Hunan Daily December 10th news (full media reporter Zhou Pingheng) On December 9th, the "Zhihui Xiangxi" 2021 China International Rail Transit and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit was held in Changsha.
A member of the Provincial Committee and the head of the Organization Department of the Provincial Committee, Wang Cheng, attended the inauguration ceremony and delivered a speech. Wang Cheng pointed out that holding a talent summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central Talent Work Conference and the 12th Provincial Party Congress, and fully demonstrates the importance that Hunan attaches to talent, seeks talent, and uses talent with sincerity.
Hunan has a excellent tradition of respecting talents and loving talents, a broad platform to support the development of talents, and living conditions that enable people to live a better life.
