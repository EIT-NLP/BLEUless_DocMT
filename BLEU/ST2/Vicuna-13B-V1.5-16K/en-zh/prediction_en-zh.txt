A few weeks after I returned home, I received a letter listing a bunch of other damage I’d be charged for as well—including scratches to the door which supposedly required repainting the rear of the car a few days after I returned my rental. None of that damage was visible to me (or the agent when I returned the vehicle).

Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

ASSISTANT: Gabba的双重电力故障解释及其可能再次发生的风险。由于板球协会等待更详细的计划来升级该体育场以举办2032年奥运会，因此对于体育场布局中存在的电力故障风险的改进可能不会在下一次Ashes系列之前实现。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

ASSISTANT: 据报道，《堪培拉时报》和《悉尼早晨邮报》称，布里斯班球场是澳大利亚唯一一个主要体育场，其场内的主要电力供应不足以启动全球广播所需的广泛传输设备。在布里斯班测试师比赛的第四天，全球广播的主要和备份发电机紧急停机约25分钟。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

ASSISTANT: 这是因为基地电力需要为 Gabba 的灯塔和场地提供电力，其中其中一个灯塔在2019年的Big Bash League比赛中出现故障。因此，广播公司的主要电力供应来自一台大型的柴油发电机，备用电力应该来自备用发电机。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.

ASSISTANT: 然而，在測試賽的第四天，主要發電機的故障與備援發電機的故障相結合，導致兩者同時停止運轉，導致近30分鐘的全部或部分廣播畫面和DRS的損失。NEP公司，該公司為Fox和Seven提供外部廣播車和其他設施，已向提供發電機的公司尋求解釋。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

ASSISTANT: 所有其他用于阿什斯（Ashes）比赛的场地 - 阿德莱德球场（Adelaide Oval）、墨尔本球场（MCG）、悉尼克里克体育场（SCG）和霍巴特Bellerive球场（Bellerive Oval）- 将提供主要供电线路作为广播机构的电源，燃油发电机作为备用电源。这一差异，以前曾引起主办广播公司Fox Cricket的诸多担忧，在阿什斯测试彩球期间由于减少的制作和技术人员数量，使得在比赛期间监控许多隐喻性的球更加困难。
USER: Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Cricket Australia were warned by Fox over several months that on a technical basis it would be safer to play the match elsewhere, but if it remained at the Gabba there would be "huge risks" inherent in the skeleton crew allowed into Queensland.

ASSISTANT: 澳大利亚板球协会在几个月的时间内收到福克斯的警告，从技术角度来看，最好在其他地方进行比赛，但如果它仍然保留在加布巴，那么在允许进入昆士兰的极少人员中存在“巨大风险”。

The threat was made on Saturday a few hours after Britain agreed to issue another 23 licenses to French fishermen to alleviate tensions between the two neighbors who have been at loggerheads over the fishing row for the past six months.

The European Union had specified a December 10 deadline for London to grant licenses to French fishing boats under Brexit, with Paris threatening European legal action in case of no breakthrough.

On that day, French fishing boats briefly blocked ferries and other boats in the ports of Calais, Saint-Malo and Ouistreham, while vehicles were also sent to disrupt traffic seeking to use the Channel Tunnel rail link.

ASSISTANT: CRPME表示，这次抗议行动将“与11月26日在布列塔尼、诺曼底和法国北部的港口封锁行动一致”。在那一天，法国渔船暂时堵塞了加来、圣马洛和欧西赖姆港口的渡轮和其他船只，而车辆也被派往破坏试图使用海底隧道的交通。
