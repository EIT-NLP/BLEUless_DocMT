The item cost less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the item's value.
I am a #PRS\_ORG# large customer, so it is not a problem for me. I just need a number or instruction on what I should include with the package so it can be tracked as a return from you.
I ordered the #PRS\_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€. Today it costs 179€.
I find this, to be honest, quite frustrating. Do I have to cancel the order and reorder for the better price, or is there another way to get a discount?
I personally also think that children should not be required to take on a parental role for their younger siblings. However, I believe it is beneficial for older siblings to take on some responsibility for looking after the younger ones.
Take a quick look, help out quickly, bring the bottle, etc. In this way, they learn responsibility, help out in the family, and feel involved.
As long as they can still be children themselves, I don't see a problem with that. If your K1 takes care of themselves for the short time being and it's okay for them, that's fine.
You can best decide for yourself whether this is suitable for your children. It's not like he has to wrap K2 and accompany him for hours when he falls asleep.
From a legal perspective, it is likely questionable. Perhaps this is why the statement of the psychologist is also included.
For if something were to actually happen like a fire, break-in, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether this is a risk you want to take, is of course up to you ;)
Please help me find the title of a book again! I read a crime / thriller a few years ago and I can still remember almost the entire plot, but I can't remember the title for the life of me. Maybe someone here knows something about it...
The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, a zookeeper commits suicide by covering himself with food and entering his predator enclosure with his prey animals.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a brief investigation, ends up at the therapist's clinic, who treats patients with fear. The commissioner has a small niece who also has a fear (of fire) and ends up at this therapist.
There are more cases of self-murder and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the site of each self-murder and document it, and post the photos on the internet. Ultimately, it turns out that this therapist runs an underground therapy group where a chip is implanted in the patients' brains that suppresses an anxiety center, and the patients are ultimately forced to face their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of the window, another deliberately drives herself to death.) This act of confronting one's fear will be referred to in the book as "the fight."
In the end, there is a big showdown at the hospital that had something to do with fire. This is the rough plot, and I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author.
If someone knows about this action or can even reveal the title of the book to me, I would be very pleased.
Oh dear, I don't have the Wi-Fi password available. I need to contact my husband first.
But that can take time. What steps should I take after that?
Is it also possible to get a refund of the price difference?
Child, 4 years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outer side) over the entire length.
Tried to pull it out with tweezers. Very difficult to grasp.
It didn't work and caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try.
No chance left. Tomorrow I'm going to the doctor.

The LokSound 5 is the most important member of the LokSound family. By combining a digital decoder and a sound module on a printed circuit board, we achieve dimensions of only 30mm x 15.5mm and can therefore be installed in almost any locomotive of the H0 and 0 scale.
LokSound 5 Decoders are offered with all common interfaces and always come with a 11x15mm large "sugar cube" speaker with a speaker basket kit. Like all family members, the LokSound5 is a true multiprotocol decoder.
He masters the data format DCC just as well as Motorola®, Selectrix®, and M4. In the DCC format, there are 14 to 128 speed levels as natural as 2- and 4-digit addresses and up to 32 functions.
Thanks to RailComPlus®, the decoders automatically register with a suitable digital central station. It supports all DCC programming modes, and with compatible central stations, CV values on the main track can be read out.
For centers that can only program the CVs of 1-255, there are auxiliary registers. Motorola® users benefit from up to 28 speed levels with 255 addresses.
Three more Motorola® addresses enable the activation of 16 functions. An integrated programming mode also allows reprogramming with the venerable Control Unit 6021.
The M4 protocol allows for automatic registration with mfx®-compatible central stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder recognizes Märklin® braking sections as well as ZIMO® HLU braking commands or the Lenz® ABC system.
Even braking with DCC braking blocks or with DC voltage is possible. In addition, he also holds with a Selectrix® braking diode.
An ABC pendulum automaton allows for automatic pendulum movement between two train stations. The LokSound 5 Decoder can be used on both analog direct and alternating current railways.
After my voucher was not extended due to a complaint that did not arrive, I will remove my order worth approximately #NUMBER#€ from my shopping cart and place it elsewhere, where customer friendliness is prioritized and I don't have to tip-toe around to achieve nothing at all!

Due to Omikron: Johnson will push for a booster shot as new Omikron cases continue to emerge in politics and science in the UK.
Therefore, all eligible adults in England will receive a vaccine offer this New Year. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to move faster with COVID-19 booster vaccinations than previously targeted due to rapidly increasing Omikron cases.
Every adult in England should already have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have passed since their second dose, Prime Minister Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his countrymen on Sunday evening. So far, the target date was set for the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support to accelerate vaccination campaigns in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing a crisis situation with the Omikron variant, which is why it is urgent to strengthen vaccine protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased again with a third dose of the vaccine. "Let's get boosted now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1,239 additional Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, bringing the total to 3,137. This represents an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. (Source: dpa)

I am in favor of everyone introducing themselves with pronouns. I have sent in an application.
Today I received an invitation for a conversation via email. I will respond to the email.
But unfortunately, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name. I have googled it and depending on where he/she has a cultural background, it is either a man or a woman.
I have no idea how to write this email now. Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want to step on any officials' toes either. Conclusion: everyone should introduce themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them are good.
Only the one I bought today doesn't work.
Apparently, the chair had an undetectable defect at the time of sale. How could such a foam damage occur otherwise after 9 months?
First try it on the #PRS\_ORG#. But it has been working since about
14 days no longer. Therefore, I have always bought the last books over the website and then read them on the #PRS\_ORG#.
I bought 6 PRS orgs and wanted to buy 8, but there were none left.
Now they are available again, and I would like to add 2 chairs to your order and bill you for them.
[CW] The feeling when I can't help. Content Warning: I will be writing here about domestic violence in some detail.
I just need to write something from the soul. I (21) often come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence for professional reasons.
A topic that really bothers me and unfortunately happens too often is that many victims cannot be helped or we think we cannot help them. I am clear that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I can't do anything in such situations. I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in a conversation with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing, I cannot reach everyone. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone, it is sometimes very close to tears, everyone is worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to accept violence.
Often I wish I could help... I know I can't. But it will never be easier that way.
Please always remember that you are worthy of living without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: How does the series fit into "League of Legends"? Lots of fantasy, many complicated names, stunning visuals: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" video game universe, has recently premiered on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two seasons?
Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim. At least youngster Johannes Patrick held up.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with regard to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have some anger in our belly."
She didn't lie down after the game, but instead became even more determined in the face of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas more than just the bare result of the game was disappointing, it was the manner of the team's performance that was most disheartening.
Substitute a statistic that expresses the whole dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was only 13 percent, 4 shots (all from young John Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions? John Patrick answered: "We were not concentrated enough after our win in Tenerife and did not execute what we trained for."
Specifically, to move the ball. Quite different reacted his counterpart Sebastian Gleim: "A cool game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg", said the happy coach.
"It felt like 10,000 people were there." Although only 750 visitors were allowed into the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they made the most of it.
Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. "The best playmaker I have ever trained," praised Gleim.
While in Patrick's team, the top performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed completely. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete rout and came within eight points after they had already trailed by 39:59.
In addition to Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points. Fortunately, there isn't much time for arguing.
Already on Wednesday (at 8 pm) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.
We had a different email address before, but I changed it.
Yes, I have already registered myself several months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have legally informed ourselves again and have written to them again for this reason. We originally registered ourselves half a year ago.
Always peeled like an egg: Max Raabe will be 59 and he is able to enchant his audience with new interpretations of hits from the 1920s and 1930s.
Currently, he is on the road with the program "Good day, dear luck" - if he is allowed to appear. Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But that won't work. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 "on official orders" to contain the coronavirus.
Other planned appearances during the Advent season must also fall through initially, as it says on the website of the singer, who is celebrating his 59th birthday today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de). From January, the artists then want to catch up on their already postponed dates from 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962, in the North Rhine-Westphalian city of Lünen, Max Raabe has been singing a lot and gladly since his youth. In Berlin, he studied opera singing, and in 1986, he founded the Palast Orchester together with his fellow students.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of schlagers and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded numerous prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached - just like his successful album "For women, this is not a problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts. He has managed to move from the niche to the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, with blonde hair strictly combed back and mindful of etiquette, Max Raabe is no longer forgettable from the current German-speaking music scene. With the program "Good day, dear luck," he has been on tour since 2020. dpa

It still doesn't work, I can only fold the cover but not flip through the pages.
Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz: The acquisition of property does not create new housing. The new Federal Minister of Building Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken out against the expropriation of large residential corporations, as has been proposed in a Berlin popular vote.
"Expropriation does not create a single new apartment, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). "My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will remain affordable in the coming years."
In a colorful mix of private landlords, cooperatives, or housing companies, by the way, is the best protection against the formation of a monopoly. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens, and Left Party plans to establish an expert commission to deal with the outcome of the referendum.
However, if the situation does not improve, Geywitz is not ruling out talks with the FDP in the traffic light coalition about further tightening of rental regulations. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation of rent increases in tight housing markets, and the expansion of the rental mirror.
I will be speaking with the Minister of Justice to implement this as quickly as possible. If the rental market does not loosen up despite this, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.

At least 100 people have died due to tornadoes in Kentucky. During a devastating storm system, numerous tornadoes have swept across the USA.
All in Kentucky could be mourning more than 100 deaths. The pictures from there remind one of a war zone.
In the night from Saturday to Sunday, several tornadoes caused severe devastation in the USA and may have claimed up to a hundred lives. The storms left a roughly 200-mile-long path of destruction, especially in the state of Kentucky.
Whose governor, Andy Beshear, said after a visit to the disaster area that everything was gone everywhere the tornado had passed through - houses, stores, government buildings - simply gone.
Parts of industrial facilities, roofs are in the trees. It is hard to imagine that this is even possible.
He calculates alone in the state of Kentucky within the branch with up to a hundred dead, the official numbers rise hourly.
Hello, I just saw that they are sold out of Vitrine #NAME#. That's very unfortunate.
Will it still be produced? Or has it been completely removed from the product line?
Is it possible to order this display case in another country?
Until when do you sign up? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I must cancel the order!
I understand that, but I can only order the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany from the shopping cart?
I had submitted an item through the contact form and wanted to follow up to inquire if it was received or being processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination bonuses and change advertising slogans. While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination bonus, companies in Austria have taken the initiative and are offering their employees financial incentives for vaccination.
This translates to:  Thus, they are in line with the social partners ÖGB and the Economic Chamber, who are calling for financial incentives for vaccination today. The redesign of advertising slogans into vaccination calls - based on the German model - is also intended to increase willingness to be vaccinated against Corona.
He switched to a company where he complained about. This does not improve his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea. It has been a year.
He has obviously not stuck to his old place and has looked for something else. You can do that too.
And that he didn't like you back then: well, who cares? He didn't like his job either.
There are too many variables.
Please note the cancellation. This will then be legally relevant.

Congratulations on your first own campaign Boron!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends through the adventure "Over the Greifenpass" and I want to seamlessly guide my heroes into a campaign specifically written for the players. We are playing DSA 5.
The big arc is done, the villains and their motivations written, the individual acts devised, and now I am working on writing the entry adventure and stumble already at the first encounter over my own feet. The premise is that the heroes have to bring a wagon with grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran Lake.
There, the further action should take place. A few miles from the village, the hero should be ambushed and lured into a trap by a group of goblins.
I want to give the player characters the option to resolve the confrontation in various ways: persuasion, action, intimidation, recognizing the danger early, whatever the players come up with. Group strength: 8 regular goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords.
"If the heroes fail to notice, the goblins lie in wait for them in a ditch on both sides of the road, armed with bows to the left and right, and two with spears to stop the wagon. If it comes to a fight and the heroes lose, I have two solutions."
1. The heroes are all unconscious and subsequently found and healed by the son of the village schoolmaster, a half-elf. The cart, of course, is gone.
2. If a defeat is unavoidable, then this half-elf will intervene with two of his henchmen and come to the hero's aid in battle. The carriage is still there, everything is fine.
How do you rate Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the encounter too much of a starting point for the adventure?
The group of goblins will play a crucial role later on, so it's not just cannon fodder.
I will definitely take many of your ideas into account and now also have more trust in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart and put it back together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. That's why I would still like to return it.

I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to blow off some steam with this post.
Firstly, the transmission was interrupted in the middle of the F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the accident during the start deviated from the schedule, they could still have shown the last ten minutes and the championship decision.
Apparently, it seems that F1 has priority for legal reasons, and therefore everything else must be restricted, so that Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the entire race.
Nonetheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the serious accident. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag.
Although there was such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about this topic to Hamilton. Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for Verstappen.
I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first puzzle solving, what is now possible or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties regarding the rules.
I generally don't like Roos's artificial commentary style, but I admit that taste is subjective. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL even more serious.
In addition to this, there are constant stupidities that both simply make them look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter in particular causes a lot of chaos in the commentary, which he obviously does not take seriously.
Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard at F1TV by listening directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.
Both of these broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not make up for the disadvantages.
The remaining program of Sky Sport F1 is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that broadcasts F1.
Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast, except for the commercials. Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion.
To the following: #PRS\_ORG# pendant lamp, brass and multi-colored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and it still hasn't been delivered. I have contacted the chat twice and haven't received any response yet.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email, but she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS\_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them already showed a defect after a relatively short time (the fabric had a hole in the front part of the chair).
I am requesting support.
Air pumps are excellent for supplying additional oxygen to an aquarium. It is also possible to operate a filter system using air pumps.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us. Please see the table at the end of the offer.
Here you can see the performances compared. If the pumps are strong enough, entire facilities can be operated with them.
If you own a large aquarium, it is suitable to use pumps with 2 or more outlets, so that you can connect more outlets. The MK series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. However, air pumps are also suitable to create an accent in the aquarium, for example, by using an air curtain (available in our shop) or by using decorations that convert air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a term like "treasure chest" or "shell" to describe it. The MK series has a special, sound-dampening construction and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple. The fan pump is connected to an outlet, etc. via a 4/6 mm air hose...and you can start right away.
The fan pump should be at the same height or higher than the water level and should be mounted outside. If the fan pump is located lower than the water level, a check valve should be installed in between.
Simply cut the air hose and place the valve in between. This would prevent water from flowing backward through the pump if it were to flow out of the pool...
If the fan pump is to be installed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps in the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Although we indicate the processing time as 3 days here on eBay, we pack daily and the packages are also picked up daily. If everything goes smoothly on the way, it goes very quickly.
We just want to prevent any disappointment in advance, so that no one is upset because it took a little longer this time. It's like that, not everyone understands all the employees who also work in the logistics industry... of course, there is no Corona here.
Please do not rate poorly just because the delivery is delayed, that is solely due to the package services. Of course, we are quick to complain about these services, even though we say at the moment...they have it damn hard.
This is also very different regionally. Don't be angry with anyone, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order the yellow ones with and without armrests? Can you also order the legs in light colors here?
Amazon founder Bezos sends astronaut's daughter and TV moderator into space. The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers have taken a short space trip.
They were transported on Saturday by the rocket system "New Shepard" of the company Blue Origin, founded by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the US state of Texas.
Under a radiant blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly-crowned astronauts back upon their return. "Welcome back," said Bezos, dressed in a blue spacesuit as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
Under applause from friends, family members, and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed out one by one and hugged the Amazon founder. According to Blue Origin, they were ten minutes and 13 seconds in the air and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after whom the rocket system of Blue Origin is named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan were honorary guests of the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much they paid for their tickets.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered after the short flight to her father's mission. He had worked hard during his deployments and had to make everything himself.
She was simply carried away, said the 74-year-old with a laugh. Even Michael Strahan expressed his enthusiasm.
"He would rather go back to space again right away," said the moderator. "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in altitude.
The rocket system "New Shepard" flies largely automated. The capsule that was separated from the rocket during the flight reached a height of about 100 kilometers above Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts see 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary between Earth and space, but there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight of Blue Origin: On the first in July, Amazon founder Bezos was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
During the second flight in October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, who became famous for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," was present, as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and the deputy head of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting the business of space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the climate.
By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should continuously glow in one color or play through its entire color spectrum. When the color change is activated, the light stone holds a light color for about a minute before gently transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the "Smart Stone" light lasts all year round outdoors. In a snowy environment, its light is particularly good - only with a shorter lifespan to be expected when the days get shorter.
Please make sure in winter that no snow impairs the function of the solar module. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh battery in the common Mignon (AA) format, which can be easily replaced if needed.

Someone who works or studies in biochemistry, I am currently studying biochemistry in my first semester and find the subject actually quite exciting, and in the lab it doesn't bother me (I have already completed the inorganic chemistry practical).
Of course, I also informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies. At that time, I also thought that I definitely wanted to study until I got my doctorate, and I will. But right now, doubts are creeping in, especially the career prospects are quite depressing.
On one hand (Studycheck etc), one always hears about great career opportunities and the profession being highly sought after, while on the other hand, one constantly hears about unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid positions. Therefore, I would really like to know:
1. What are you currently working on? 2. Are you satisfied with your job/salary?
1. What have you studied/ What education or training have you received? 2. Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers! I am currently really unsure and am considering in 2022 possibly dropping out of my studies and doing an training to become a IT specialist.
If you have any experiences, feel free to share them as well :)
Extra stress during vacations and holiday weekends. This topic came up last week for me.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax from it. That's why I'm posting about it only now.
Not only before big holidays, such as Christmas holidays, is there a lot of stress in our company. As it seems, there is also a lot of stress before holidays and bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was the Ascension of Mary, which is called "Ascension Day" with us in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
Last week, there was a long four-day weekend at home. What happened last week?
Everywhere stress. Loud emails that absolutely had to be sent before departure, order here order there, everything *absolutely* before the long weekend.
Because... well, because? Because "next week then" after so much time doesn't sound right?
Or because people want to achieve as much in a shortened week as they do in a normal one? Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but I was also pretty annoyed.
What is this self-imprisonment for holidays? Why do we even have holidays if we can't enjoy them properly?!
The stress didn't come from above, the colleagues were all very independent. My question is simply: Are we, the Swiss, the only ones like this?
Is this our reformed-evangelical way? Or do you know this in the north as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is looking forward to Christmas in Thuringia. Yvonne Catterfeld (42) is looking forward to Christmas in her Thuringian homeland - but she hasn't bought any gifts yet.
"Even if there's no snow in Erfurt, then one simply goes to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest", said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH. She will get into the spirit of the festival by baking and bastele with her son.
"I love that", said Catterfeld. But until the thoughtful days, she still had a lot to do: "I haven't gotten any gifts yet, I have to start now."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth shedding process and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all essential vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg of biotin per kg.
NETON-Bio gives the bird a smooth and glossy plumage. The majority of feather damage occurring in bird keeping are exclusively due to nutritional errors.
Since the plumage consists of protein-containing substances, the formation of perfect feathers requires a particularly rich and balanced protein diet for the bird. For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals, and trace elements.
In a large part of the animal losses that occur during the moulting period, they are based on insufficient or unbalanced protein intake and/or insufficient supply of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feedstuffs is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
During the application of NEKTON-Bio, no other vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is water-soluble and can be easily given through drinking water or through soft food.
Thank you, I found it but unfortunately it still doesn't work.
"Yes, the F-parts are, I have received a bed from you."
However, there were problems with one part. The middle bar is held by two feet...unfortunately, these are too narrow and the bar cannot be mounted on them.
What should we do now? I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is held by two feet, unfortunately, these are defectively produced. The middle bar does not fit into the intended holder.
I'm also receiving new ones. When will they be sent out?
There are no flat ones. According to the assembly instructions, these are the correct ones in terms of shape, but they were too narrow.
But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose.
At me, they are not flat. Could I have gotten these sent to me?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Residential fire with two lightly injured and high damage Two people were slightly injured in a residential fire in Bavaria, Germany.
In addition, an estimated damage in the five-digit euro range has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire had apparently spread from a carport to the adjacent residential building in Kinsau (Landsberg am Lech district).
Two residents were reportedly taken to the hospital with minor smoke inhalation on Sunday. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not initially suspect arson.
The criminal police in Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over further investigations.
That comes much later and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To debunk fake news - Biontech-CEO publishes vaccination photo Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Biontech CEO Uğur Şahin had not publicly expressed his vaccination status so far. Now, the entrepreneur published a photo that shows his COVID-19 vaccination.
The illness of a friend has prompted him to share, said Şahin. The CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company BioNTech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing him receiving a vaccination against the coronavirus.
In social media, there were false information that I supposedly wasn't vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I have received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine," wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the "LinkedIn" network.
"For months, friends have been urging me to post a photo of myself getting vaccinated in order to counteract these false rumors. So far, I have refused to do so because communication should not revolve around oneself."
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply saddened to learn that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is struggling with a severe case of Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The school friend and his family are not vaccinated, wrote Shahin further. He did not ask about the reasons.
The most common cause seems to be fear, which is often fueled by misinformation and mistrust. Fear is difficult to combat with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview with Deutsche Welle circulating on the internet in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"It is currently not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself", said Şahin at the time. There is a prioritization in Germany for vaccinating the vaccine.
Meanwhile, the prioritization has been lifted - and the BioNTech CEO has reportedly been vaccinated three times according to his own statements.
Fire in substation: tens of thousands of people without power - In several communities in North Rhine-Westphalia, the lights went out on Friday evening: no power and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had rendered a transformer station inoperable. In the Rhein-Sieg district in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, tens of thousands of people had to do without electricity for around 24 hours after a fire caused significant damage to a transformer station.
Due to the fire, the lights went out for 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities on Friday evening. The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday, numerous emergency power generators were in operation until the widespread disruption was finally fully resolved late in the evening.
Firefighters and helpers and female helpers of the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered childcare places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their efforts. We are fully aware that the last 24 hours have caused significant restrictions.
"We also thank the affected municipalities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Department, in a statement on Saturday evening. "Repairing the damage will still take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to temporarily restore some cables," he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to the company's statements, and the electricity is flowing again.
The fire that broke out around 7:15 p.m. on Friday has severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid transformer station, according to Westnetz. Extensive cleaning and repair work will be required there.
In addition to this, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the current supply is restored.
Since Saturday at 6 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had power again. An additional 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid were gradually connected from 9:30 pm.
Since 23:15, even the last affected by the outage have had power. Over 80 electricians from Westnetz and partner companies have been deployed.
The authorities had also called for neighborhood assistance after setting up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon. "It is important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially the elderly or those living alone, and inform the local fire stations when help is needed," explained District Administrator Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
When setting up and operating emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed strom-dependent medical devices or were dependent on medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the ceiling in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in euros? It's the #PRS\_ORG# daybed in blue-green.
I hope you have a beautiful day as well and please stay healthy ♡
However, I cannot mount the subframe on the tabletop. It is a custom #NAME#.
There are 3 versions available. We wanted those with tabletop diameters of #NUMBER#
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS\_ORG# arrived, but I can't move it around and thus shorten it. Can you help me with that?
Then I would have to send it back because it is not suitable for the purpose otherwise. I would appreciate a response.
Sure, that's much easier! Then let's do it that way!
Please send me the return label by email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, I had not restarted the E-#PRS\_ORG#. Should I do that now?
A discount that low, I find almost impolite. We are not in agreement with that.
Nordic Combined: Riiber wins, German Nordic Combined athletes Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid finish on the podium at the World Cup in Otepää, Estonia.
The duo had to surrender again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had started the cross-country skiing with a significant lead after the ski jumping.
Reverse of order number #NUMBER# When will the money be credited back to my account?
Sure, here's the translation:  "Yes, we both have s new made and use version 4.5... it could be that they have often heard of problems."
I bought a book directly from my #PRS\_ORG#, it seems to be the case. As soon as I want to open it, the message appears, ups!
This document cannot be opened. The file may be defective. Please contact customer service.
As far as I can tell, it is an EPUB file. Can you help me?

To ensure that the paint job is even and clean, you should clean the parts with soapy water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, rinse with clean water, and dry them. Before bringing the brush to the model for the first time with a new color, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the non-visible inner side of the components or on a yogurt cup. The first stroke on the component
Brush the brush evenly stroke by stroke. Light overlap of color layers later ensures an even surface.
Avoid rapid back-and-forth brushing with the brush. This creates unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence. Start with the bright colors.
The dark colors could shine through later. Metallic tones and metallic colors are added at the very end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, there can be unattractive metal flakes when they mix with normal colors. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve their faithful appearance through decals or stickers. From emblems on aircraft to ship names to decorative stripes and license plates on car models: the decals give the model the final touch.
Arrange the decals in the correct sequence while the parts are still accessible. It is easier to apply decals to an aircraft cockpit before it is installed in the fuselage.
More important than the right tool such as scissors, tweezers, and toothpick are patience, time, and a steady hand when applying decals. Cut each required decal individually and arrange them as needed.
Decals are also known as water slides, because you moisten the back of them briefly with water until the carrier paper turns dark. Then you slide the image only a little bit from the paper and place the piece on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also moistened beforehand).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, you pull the carrier paper sideways away. Attention: Always check first if the image is sitting correctly before you completely slide it off the paper, so it doesn't stick to your finger, wrinkle or even tear.
Squeeze out excess water with a household cloth. Not suitable for children under 3 years of age.
I can only briefly open a book, as soon as I look for something else, I can no longer read and have to log out and log back in and find the place where I left off reading. On Saturday, I have already communicated with you.
Will I receive this by email? Also for all 3 packages?
"For the lamp came in three separate packages to me."
Alright, thank you anyway! I will buy elsewhere as soon as the money is refunded.
Will I get it back problem-free?
Pregnancy treatment under statutory health insurance / What is an "insurance case"? Hello everyone,  In today's video, we will talk about pregnancy treatment under statutory health insurance and explain what an "insurance case" is.  If you are pregnant and have statutory health insurance, you are entitled to certain benefits and treatments. These include, for example, prenatal care, childbirth, and postnatal care. However, there may be cases where your insurance company denies coverage for certain treatments or procedures.  In such cases, you can file an "insurance case" with your insurance company. This is a formal request for coverage of a specific treatment or procedure that your insurance company has denied. You can file an insurance case if you believe that the treatment or procedure is medically necessary and should be covered by your insurance.  To file an insurance case, you will need to provide your insurance company with documentation supporting the medical necessity of the treatment or procedure. This may include medical records, test results, and letters from your doctor.  If your insurance company denies your insurance case,
We were in fertility treatment for a while, but now that it comes to settling accounts with the health insurance, it suddenly becomes difficult. In the following order:
We had applied for the fertility treatment in advance with our private health insurance and received the approval for up to three attempts. The attempts were not in any way restricted (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to a successful pregnancy and birth and was accounted for with private health insurance. Some time later, we tried to have a second child and made 2 (unsuccessful) attempts, but did not count these with the private health insurance.
We again requested the cost coverage from the statutory health insurance (PKV) and were granted another 3 attempts. After several more attempts (we conducted more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The justification: With pregnancy/birth, the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise expire. The second desire for a child is a new insurance event.
According to the GTC, however, "The insurance event begins with the start of treatment, it ends when the need for treatment no longer exists." The questions for the experts in the round are:
Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 attempts are reimbursed) or us (we have to reimburse 5 attempts)? Should the PKV have informed us in the terms and conditions that with a birth, the remaining attempts would expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? The infertility (caused by closed fallopian tubes) is not cured by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give their opinion here. Thank you very much for your help already!
Can you please send me the three variants by email and tell me how I can best achieve them?
Alright. We won't be ordering anything from them anymore.
If you and your friend #NAME# (same address) add up your sales, it's obvious that they've lost a good customer. They can certainly pass that on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment was initiated and now he's telling me that I have to return the item first. I can't do anything about the fact that the commode was completely disturbed when it arrived at my place.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote. It clearly and clearly states that the repayment was initiated and I still have not received any repayment via #PRS\_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment from his account.
We will no longer do that. No, the defect only occurred after several months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they cannot sell it as a desk chair.
Regardless, the warranty lasts for 24 months.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain packaging in any other way. I will disassemble the cabinet and make it available to the transport company in that way.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS\_ORG promoted products. Are these products also being purchased with additional hooks, which we unfortunately cannot find with you?
Can you help?
Topic of the week: The best low-budget films What exactly a low-budget film is, there is no general definition with exact budget limits.
According to Wikipedia, a low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture shot with little to no funding from a major film studio or private investor.
You can find plenty of lists of low-budget films on the internet, such as on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it? And what might you not like at all?
I am a very satisfied customer of yours, having already fully furnished two apartments with your furniture. I would like to inquire about the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable? Thank you.
With friendly greetings, there is no telephone number, a chat where you have to wait 30 minutes is not a chat!
Unfortunately, the waiting position does not change... I will give up again soon because it simply does not work here. Hello
"Partial victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU associated. According to political expert Raphael Bossong, the EU can announce a "partial victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs, however, were very high and resulted in significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarusian border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd). The EU has not sustainably resolved the confrontation, said the researcher from the Berlin-based Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (SWP).
This state of limbo - Belarus is not exactly small, but the EU feels like a winner - is likely to continue for a while longer. Bossong judged that the handling of people at the border is not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.
Apparently, there is a "growing normalization of pushbacks" by individual EU governments. As the EU as a whole has not decided to take action against it, it comes at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time. "She can apparently not assert herself when a member state insists on doing things its own way," as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even grant the EU border protection agency Frontex access to the border.
In addition, the EU is paying a price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong points out: The basic consensus on asylum policy will be made more difficult, as the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt at border crossing
According to statements from Poland's border guard, migrants have again attempted to cross the border from Belarus into Polish territory. 55 migrants were arrested overnight on Sunday and returned to the border, a spokesperson for the agency said on Sunday.
The Polish officials were reportedly pelted with stones by the migrants near the town of Czeremsza. According to the reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be medically treated by a military doctor.
In total, the border protection registered 52 attempted border crossings within 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months, or attempted to do so. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the ruler in Minsk, of having lured them with the prospect of entering the EU.
Poland and Lithuania have reportedly sealed off border sections, according to press reports. The EU has imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travel to the countries of origin of the people, in order to prevent departures there. The most effective element of the EU's reaction would be pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"There, the EU has thrown its market power into the balance and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard sanctions and extraterritorial measures." Minsk must also consider the internal political costs.
The Belarusian society may not be prepared for the fact that the security apparatus regularly pushes thousands of people through the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale, as they believe Max Verstappen committed two rule violations during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has lodged a protest. The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
In protest refers to an alleged breach by Max Verstappen at Red Bull in the last Safety Car phase, where he is said to have overtaken irregularly. A second objection has been lodged against the scoring at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed in a regulation-compliant manner. Verstappen had overtaken Lewis Hamilton in the Mercedes on the last lap and was on his way to his first Formula 1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a safety car period, during which the Dutch driver in front of him had overtaken.
I am checking that. I am speaking with the bank and will report back to you.
Thank you for the support.
Free admission for members: Europa-Park is hosting the SC Freiburg Fantag. The Europa-Park, namesake of the Europa-Park Stadium of the Sport-Club Freiburg, has invited to the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park's announcement, members and season ticket holders of the sports club from the Breisgau region, as well as members of the fan community, were allowed to visit the Europa-Park for free on that day. In addition, there were vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coaster trains glowed red and white on this day through the jerseys. Foxes, Ed Euromaus, and many red-white balloons provided the perfect backdrop, according to the park.
Already since the beginning of the 90s, there has been a cooperation between the Bundesligisten and the leisure park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg. At the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park, it has once again been shown how well the partnership fits.
"Bright fans enjoying the roller coaster together confirm that," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim" as part of the "LiteraTour Nord" reading series. The author read from her current novel "Daheim" on Friday at the sold-out Blue Note and also moderated the event.
She is divorced, lives in a house by the coast, and listens sensitively to the nighttime sounds at her door.
I submitted the contact form for returning an article yesterday, but I did not receive any email confirmation or similar. My question would be whether my request has been received.
Not everyone has the time for your idiotic chat and poorly delivered cheap goods from China. Your mistake, which you don't fix and not all from our household.
Please contact Mrs. #NAME#. I cannot chat with them every day.
We had agreed yesterday in a chat that I, or Mrs. #NAME#, would receive an email with a 60 euro voucher, a repeat order of the #PRS\_ORG# nightstand, and a return label. This email has not arrived yet.
The package wants to bring to #PRS\_ORG# today. Please contact me.

Sorry, but just because he says he's not an anti-Semite doesn't mean it's true. That's like when an AfD member says they have nothing against foreigners.
They will not give each other their own. But Kollegah constantly reproduces various anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, then you should simply let it go completely. Yeah, wow, then you are just as little to be taken seriously as Kollegah.
Anyone who seriously questions the evolution fundamentally is simply completely lost. As far as I'm concerned, God started it all.
But as soon as you are a creationist, you must believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is just nonsense. And that makes you an enemy of science and not to be taken seriously like Kollegah.
To obtain an optimal field of view, the loupe should be brought as close as possible to the eye. The specifically planar-achromatic lens system allows you to use the loupe practically free of distortion and color errors even in the outer zone.
Often binoculars are marked with magnification specifications. However, these specifications only apply to exactly defined conditions that rarely correspond to the conditions of use.
To optimize your use of the loupe, we kindly ask you to follow the guidelines in the "Technical Data" table (see instructions in the packaging). Light reflections can occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact-resistant lenses.
By applying an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. If the optimal usage conditions are followed - the loupe is held close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Fir tree sales in Schönwolde: In the municipality of Krembz, women search for Christmas trees. Farmer Frank Diers has experienced many curious situations during his fir tree sales.
One time, a man even had to be driven home alone by his partner because they couldn't agree. He plants around 2000 pieces every year for this.
There, the 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations. This makes the pre-Christmas period a bit fun, he says.
And what about the voucher? Otherwise, I'm out as a customer!
At least I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it. I will also rate it accordingly!
We don't need to have discussions here about the better dish, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names. In German, an equivalent might be something like the "Dreher," which definitely doesn't sound as tasty.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic We have had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I am currently having trouble building a stable WiFi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit flawlessly except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and also to the DLan module attached to the FritzBox. However, on the other DLan module that emits WiFi, the full 500 no longer come, but the more I move away from the module with the device in the house, the less comes (i.e., use a socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This results in the Internet being slower in the first floor with the new fiber optic connection (~45 Mbit) than before. I have also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses a new technology.
This was indeed better than the DSL, but there were also similar losses here. Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" over the power line with glass fiber?
And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely time-consuming to lay LAN cables in the house.
I am really at my wit's end, which is why I created this account specifically. Therefore, I would be all the more grateful for a response.
When it's time to switch to a current account, who would have thought that there would be peace and quiet with current accounts, finds themselves deceived.
While many banks have used the fall to confirm to their customers the fee increases of the past with all sorts of tricks, the free balances for negative interest rates are also declining further. The Deutsche Bank, for example, was long considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
Now she has just halved the allowance and even quartered it for savings accounts. In the first step, the limit was only lowered for customers of the Postbank corporate division - to 50,000 euros for current and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for savings accounts.
Meanwhile, however, these lower allowances apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesman confirmed upon request. And that not only for new contracts, but also for "newly concluded individual agreements with existing customers".
The Commerzbank had previously lowered the limit to 50,000 euros, which still applies, as does the case with ING Germany. The popular direct bank DKB, which is particularly popular with cost-conscious customers, has lowered the credit limits in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
Nonetheless: More than 100 banks have already reached a free allowance of 25,000 euros or less, according to figures from the internet portal Verivox. The Sparda-Bank Berlin has also reached 25,000 euros: However, there is still a legal dispute with consumer centers there, which even won in first instance before the Berlin Regional Court against this regulation.
Now, banks are already discussing whether the institutes should form reserves - in case the higher authorities declare negative interest rates to be fundamentally illegal and have to refund millions to bank customers.
The table top for 8 people was delivered instead of the one for 6 people. The base is the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston leads a whole beauty army and is now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But their life is like a mountain and valley journey. Jennifer Aniston (52) was chosen by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For her, who made a fuss in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers take care of her appearance.
Anyway, according to Aniston, she allows herself one chip a day (yes, read correctly: just ONE chip from the bag). That the hearts of both male and female fans still beat equally is actually a miracle.
Perhaps because she simply has bad luck - and is still searching for true love. And has crossed off the baby wish from her list.
Previously, she was constantly asked when she would become a mother. This hurt her.
The people who asked that have no idea what's going on with me medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame also bring happiness.
Undeserving end of a career: Räikkönen has to retire Kimi Räikkönen's farewell from Formula 1 ended quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn wiped his forehead with a handkerchief and said, "That's it."
After a driving mistake and a minor tire touch, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo after less than half of the race distance in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. It was his 349th and final Formula 1 race, as the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
For his farewell, his wife Minttu and the two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates. Räikkönen's greatest success was winning the 2007 World Championship in a Ferrari.
He achieved 21 Grand Prix victories, started from pole position 18 times, and finished on the podium 103 times. (dpa)
Friedrich wins 60th World Cup victory - Nolte wins in the two-man bob - Sports The brand of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsled pilot.
"I've calculated it, I would need to win nine and a half races per season to make it to Cortina 2026", said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg, who achieved two successes in two days at the races in Winterberg. First, he fended off Johannes Lochner's attack by five hundredths on Saturday, moving up from third to first place.
Then he changed something in the material setting and drove ahead with a lead of 0.30 seconds on Sunday. With his team consisting of Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg), and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle), he beat the British driver Brad Hall.
Third was the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also brought in his 22nd consecutive victory.
The Berchtesgaden-bound Johannes Lochner from Stuttgart came in fifth this time after previously coming in second. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach finished eighth after placing fourth in the first race.
"If I knew what he does differently, I would do it too", said Lochner. Nolte with home win - podium for Jamanka.
On the women's side, Laura Nolte secured her third season win in the two-woman bob on her home track. After only managing a fourth-place finish in the monobob the day before, she stormed to victory on Sunday as part of Germany's triple victory with pusher Deborah Levi in the World Cup.
Two-woman bobsleigh Olympic champion Mariama Jamanka from BRC Thüringen came in second place with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. She not only qualified for the Olympics but also achieved her first podium finish this winter.
The Wiesbaden woman Kim Kalicki finished third with Leonie Fiebig. For me, it was super cool, first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me along.
I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the start, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just pushing, there is also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed about the not entirely error-free journeys, but said: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the ceiling in my shopping cart and could buy it now! What should I do?
I have not received it either and therefore could not redeem it, which is why I finally asked about it. Last year, due to Corona, I had completely different problems and never had the time for it.
And now it was said it had expired, which really annoyed me. Look in the chat, it was about the Asare seat bench.
I want to return it and then order it again because it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipment only started on March 16th when there was no mention of such a long delivery time on your website?
No, only when I tap on it does an extra field appear with the message.
"It was collected from your colleague yesterday. Why is it a problem today?"
I have also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
But we still want the shelf module, a new undamaged one, not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello dear wonderful girls and women,
I have something I simply want to write down and maybe it will be of interest to someone else as well... I am 24, have kPTBS, am a full-time student, and a dog mom - aside from the fact that my dog doesn't bark or go to daycare, he is basically my child 1-on-1.
My friend (together for 6 years) is sick, he has burned himself 2nd degree on Monday and is depressive for years (but now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him, because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see and feel him, we have cuddled a lot and it was nice.
I helped him shower (because his hand is in a bandage due to burns). He is also burnt out and we currently see each other less often (1-2 times a week) which makes it difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My dog is currently suffering from stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he is lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I used a heating pad and stroked him. I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she is away for a month right now.
Now we also have homework coming up, which we will of course divide among ourselves. But cooking is a lot of work for me...
My PTBS condition is currently well regulated, I am halfway well treated and I am managing. Not good, but I am managing and am almost symptom-free.
My university is currently demanding a lot (from me), tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test for which I have done nothing, and on Tuesday of next week I have an anatomy lesson for which I should at least prepare a little. And what comes next is in my calendar, not in my head because there is no more space there.
My week goes like this: Only until tomorrow, then it's the weekend. But does it continue after that?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of the vacation.
Only until the weekend. Only until...
And so it goes on forever. I believe I just need these mental cues because otherwise I'll mess it up.
In some way, I feel guilty and "chaotic", but I can't do it any other way... Does it also happen to you?
Honestly, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work. I am really infinitely grateful, I can't even put it into words.
I don't know if I would have survived my kptbs otherwise. I think it also had a lot to do with the mental load that women carry and that's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a refreshing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today, unfortunately, the whole other color and surface is scratched and the table leg has a print. In the first delivery, the color was exactly as shown on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!! What can you offer me?
"When we switch tables now, will I get a different color or what?"
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#. In any case, it was sent twice.
It was not confirmed.
There was so much more to it: I realized in school that many religion teachers didn't believe in God and saw it as just another subject like math or geography. For me, that was always a bit strange, maybe also because I was raised Christian and I always kind of believed.
How do you feel about it? Perhaps you can also share experiences with coworkers or classmates with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional matters and it is reasonable to keep them separate. There is also a curriculum, etc.
But it seems strange to have a physics teacher who doesn't believe in the theory of relativity. What would motivate someone to want to teach religion if they don't believe in it?
Is this about preserving culture or something? I hope this question isn't too private.
Can't it be changed or something? Please write in English, I understand it well. That's already been like this for a long time, so I would give up on it.
It's good, thank you. I expect a response soon, no later than the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Film search help please Hallo dear people,
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24). I believe it was a movie for young people.
In the film, there are two timelines (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the realm of the dead) (not quite sure). Because I can't describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead, a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from Pirates of the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a plot is formed.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the realm of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm so that he can continue to live, I believe. The transition, I believe, is also the soldier's grave.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If this resonates with you, I would be grateful for any response.
Our little one has been sleeping on her stomach since week 1. Fast forward: still alive;)
Relax yourself. Children can endure much more than one might think.
Make sure everything is in order, no cuddly animals, occasionally go in and take a look, but no continuous monitoring. That would drive you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress.
No pillows. Oh, and we didn't have a sleeping bag either, we always had a blanket.
Observe your child when they sleep. Do they turn their head to the side?
Can something be propped up from the belly? Or does it lie face down directly on the mattress?
You can check this, whether everything is in order. We are also all grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the children to sleep on their stomachs.
Additionally, we are already a "regular customer" with you and have purchased many articles. But why are you then only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I have already written with a colleague of yours yesterday and have not received a response yet. It concerns my wardrobe, which arrived the day before yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#).
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet. Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To be quite clear, RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV as well.
It's just that the policy of this broadcaster is now under all sauce. Almost every format is sponsored (okay), but then they go on a big belt tour at the same time.
It was said that they were an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: "We don't want to be a running billboard."
What are we now? A 0815 advertising broadcaster trying to bring its merchandise to the elite fan.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. Of course, these apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to insult people. A Krogmann who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ash out of the rented rooms that exploded at the expense of the action.
How should one find all of this good? Great if you like it, I find it terrifying.
I am requesting a return, as the wooden table delivered to me is defective. The body is damaged due to a damaged delivery from #PRS\_ORG#.
Whether as a comfort for stomach ache or simply for cuddling - my little heat friend is versatile in use. Cherry stone pillows are a traditional home remedy for soothing warmth applications, as cherry stones can absorb heat very well and release it again in a dosed manner.
The removable inner cushion can be easily warmed in the microwave or in the oven. The soft cover makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when they don't feel so good.
The cherry pit cushion with reference is intended exclusively as a heat application for the following areas of application: Before warming the cushion, check for unusual odors, stains or burns and dispose of them immediately if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the cover before warming it up in the microwave! Warm it up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (following the manufacturer's instructions!).
Immediately after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it! Then place the inner pillow back in the cover.
During the first warm-ups, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but this disappears with repeated applications. Please strictly follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy outputs can lead to damage (fire and burn hazard!).
Please check before warming the pacifier in the microwave whether heating of grain products is allowed in the manufacturer's instructions. After the warmed inner pad has been placed back in the cover, please check the temperature of the pacifier on your wrist to ensure it is suitable for babies (max. 43°C).
Do not use the pillow with acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, circulatory disorders, fresh bruises, bleeding and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain perception. Please consult a doctor before use if you have existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes or tumor diseases, as well as during pregnancy.
If any seams have opened and loose cores have come out, dispose of the product and the loose cores immediately and in a way that is inaccessible to children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the baby should be checked regularly during use to rule out overheating!
All incidents related to the product that have occurred must be reported to the manufacturer and the relevant authority in the country where the user is based. The product is removable and can be washed at 30°C in the machine.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after winning the second half against Düsseldorf 98, Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football Bundesliga.
While Hannover 96 is working its way out of the table cellar, things are not going well for Ingolstadt under their third coach either.
Cheering in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hanover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the unsuccessful debut under new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery broken? Last night my laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer charged by my power adapter.
I bought this about 5 months ago, so it should still be working. I thought the power supply alone would be enough for operation.
Failure, the battery is empty and the laptop no longer starts even with the plugged-in power adapter. Therefore, I removed the battery, but nothing happened.
Do you have any ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in network operation?
Is something else broken? Thank you for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS\_ORG# to be brought to my room. How can I book it?
I am interested in the #PRS\_ORG# chair. But I don't know how high the seating area is...
Often on tour and yet with a lot of equipment? No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
20-liter capacity can also swallow larger photo equipment without any problems, which can be safely stored with the help of the padded FlexFold dividers. And everything else you need in everyday life remains well organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to the practical accessories in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series also presents itself in a new look. The stylish, minimalist design has it in a nutshell - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and still allow for quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: either conventionally through the lid flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch locking system, an excellent solution for effective protection that has already been proven in messenger bags. In the locking flap, there is a metal locking hook with matching anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of different "fill levels": there are actually 4 anchor bars, securely welded, into which the locking hook can be hooked. If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the top bar, if it is rather empty, a deeper one.
Flap closure and hook are also magnetic. This way, the backpack can also be reliably closed without the hook having to be hooked in.
The second option fundamentally distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other photo backpacks: In addition to the top lid, there is also a tear-open opening on both sides of the backpack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you no longer have to dig through the contents!
At the same time, this clever detail increases the everyday practicality of the backpack enormously: If you don't just take your photo equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage with you. In the Everyday Backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more on that below) and thus separate both easily - and also access them independently through the two side openings.
In addition, you can also pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right main compartment, while everyday items remain safely in the left backpack compartment and do not interfere. Comfortable, adjustable carrying straps help with this.
And since the outer layer of the backpack is made completely from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents will stay dry even when it's supposed to rain in Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I am still waiting for the email from their support. #NAME# sent me an email yesterday confirming the commissioning.
Contact from the shipping company regarding the collection of the incorrectly delivered table has been announced. So far, I have not received any message.
I am requesting immediate resolution. I am now communicating with the third support staff member, with none of whom I have progressed beyond the promise that I will receive an email confirmation.
It concerns the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It needs to be clarified when the cabinet could be delivered again? Keeping it like this is not an option for me...
It works. Thank you very much for your help.
I wish you a nice evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were made on January 12th, 2021.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will place a larger order, but nevertheless, I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back. And that the past year did not go as expected, I could not have imagined and could not have redeemed and clarified it in a timely manner.
But the damage I accept as a customer, I do not accept that.
Rotinger brake discs are designed for the demands of dynamic drivers who appreciate the reliability and safety of braking even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake discs are produced by casting and then mechanically processed (drilled and cut).
All glass plates are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics that are specific to certain glass plates and patterns. Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that takes into account the cutting of the glass plate according to the properties of the original installation.
The bent screens produced in this way ensure high comfort and braking efficiency. Additionally created openings increase the cooling efficiency of the screen, while the cutouts improve the cleaning of the brake discs and brake pads.
The aesthetic properties of our tinted windows emphasize the character of every car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing pebbles in the water at the southern fork of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery a secret, the news quickly spread and triggered the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and thriving cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the wealth of the country.
For many, it meant "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptcy)! In this game, you are a pioneer seeking wealth in the West and wanting to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, gather horses, and build companies. You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding riverbanks and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - it seems that the other pioneers have the same idea! You must surpass your pioneer colleagues in order not to go bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many paths to victory. You choose your actions simultaneously, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that increasingly works for you (known as "Engine Building").
The buildings on your game board allow you to become more efficient, gain additional actions, or have rules in your favor. With these buildings and the dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma is played over a period of three years from 1848 (the year in which gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush), to 1850 (the year in which California gained official statehood). One year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players secretly and simultaneously choose a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Afterward, their choices are revealed, and they place their pioneers on the appropriate locations.
If a location has the most pioneers, it receives a block! This deactivates half of the location - reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving wagons, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening businesses, and positioning revolver heroes. Once all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The auctioneer spins around at the beginning of each round to a new location and thus changes the available actions. This continues until the auctioneer has moved five times, i.e. has covered every location once, and the year ends.
There is a shooting range where players must defend Coloma against an impending bandit attack. If players have contributed enough Revolver Heroes and are numerically superior to the bandits, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up in the cemetery. The game ends after the third shooting, followed by the final score.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I use the shipping method "Warensendung" up to the dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm.
"Other than that, it is usually insured with DPD and comes with tracking (the game is involved, wrapped in plastic wrap and bubble wrap). If you are a collector, I can also send it in a cardboard box within a cardboard box for an additional fee of 2 euros, so that it arrives 100% free of any printing marks."
"Why Children Are Not Tyrants" Documentary, ARD Media Library CW psychological violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it right away. >The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a frequent guest on talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008), he sparked a heated debate on child-rearing. Former patients and legal guardians are now making serious accusations against him.
Please be aware that the film is difficult to watch. And I am very grateful that many people are now thinking and acting differently.
To parents and other responsible parties, it must never, never, ever be about gaining power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child freedom for their development and to make the framework for the child as large as it is reasonable and possible in the situation.
"Brrr, I'm still shivering."
Holetschek: Countries are consulting on the abolition of the testing obligation for triple vaccinated individuals. The health ministers of the countries want to decide on a nationwide abolition of the testing obligation for triple vaccinated individuals at their next meeting.
"We, the countries, need quick clarity on whether and when the testing requirement can be waived for those who have been vaccinated three times," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the Conference of Health Ministers, to "Bild am Sonntag". Holetschek said that the elimination of 2G plus for those who have been vaccinated three times is "not only medically reasonable, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination."
Federal Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has agreed to make a proposal to the Health Ministers Conference on the following Tuesday. - afp
I also want to return the lamp. What is the best way to do this?
Hello, I find the #PRS\_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me?
I am unable to complete any more purchases through my #PRS\_ORG. Error message: Oh no, an error has occurred.
Shopping via the #PRS\_ORG# page on the computer is possible. I have updated my account details.
What could this be due to?
What you describe is referred to as "awareness," which refers to sensory perceptions under general anesthesia. These occur at a frequency of about 1 in 1000.
Most commonly, it involves hearing sounds/voices, less frequently seeing images, and the rarest of all is perceiving pain. Relevant to this topic: Cesarean sections are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as they avoid deep anesthesia to protect the child until weaning.
Previous episodes of awareness should be mentioned during the anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia procedures, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
Dear all, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex did not have it by definition. I misunderstood their comment.
The chair is defective. Unfortunately, the 20€ won't help either.
This is a statement about legal warranty claims. The absolute minimum would be for them to take back the defective chair.
This is besides the legal obligation also a standard in the eCommerce area. Please check again if they at least take back the defective chair.
We sell the second chair privately then, and we also lose quite a bit of money.
I already sent you an email which you did not reply to. Again, the question.
The order and the invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The carrier is company #NAME#.
I just called there. They told me that they only deliver to the front door because of #PRS\_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I must cancel the order, as I do not know any person who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor for me.
Why wasn't I called? I had formulated a question.
Theater historian Günther Rühle has died at the age of 97. He made a name for himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later, he wrote a monumental theater history. Günther Rühle passed away at the age of 97 on Friday.
There's a new book on the table, fresh off the press: "An old man grows older". It's a shocking diary of a slow farewell to the world that the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle has kept from April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author has died. The last sentence in the book reads: "I hereby testify my gratitude for life."
There are different types of pallets. One of the most common are Euro pallets, standardized wooden pallets that are mainly used as load carriers in the European area.
They will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL in 2020, according to data from Statistics Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria.
The production value was around 79 million euros. The number of pallets imported into Austria annually is not recorded.

Rolled-up Tips & Tricks I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
That was for Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttery! So thank you again for that :)
Now I have developed a taste for it and I want to cook rouladen for the first time on New Year's Eve. Tomorrow I will prepare a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I don't have an oven, only a large pot.
How is it going now? What happened to the books and how do I get them back on my #PRS\_ORG#?
My English may not be as good anymore, but I'll manage.
This is about a reimbursement of €#NUMBER#. I was already informed by email on January 18th that the reimbursement had been made.
But until today, the money has not yet been credited to me. Could you please check on this?
Where there is still Christmas roast in the room for many people, goose or duck belong to the Christmas days like the Christmas tree and the gifts.
Have you bought any poultry yet? Time is running out.
We'll let you in on a secret: where you can still get a Christmas roast in Lübeck.
The "drive" of a tube stage significantly contributes to the warmth and fatness of the guitar amplifier sound. These characteristics are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN-, and MASTER VOLUME-regulator, you can set both the desired level and the distortion content of your sounds. In addition, the amplifiers in the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-regulator, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "Gain" and distortion.
Above, it was already mentioned that the POWER LEVEL regulator can even liven up a performance reserve when it gets a bit too loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL regulator, the full potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. Here, the signal is processed with a box simulation, so that you get an "acoustic" sound impression, even when using headphones or direct recordings.
The AUX input allows you to connect a CD or MP3 player, so you can jam along to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board, so you don't need a separate tuner.
If you also get a VFS5 foot controller, you can easily call up the sounds with your foot, turn the effect blocks on and off, and adjust the tempo of the compatible effects "tapping". For live use, this is actually indispensable.
With its new power packages, VOX is taking another step into the future!
But have you seen that with others? Is there then the possibility to send the lamp back?
"Is it too low for a dining table? So I would like to send it back then."
Can you help me with that?
And the chest of drawers? Will we receive another update in the next few weeks on the exact delivery date?
Hello, have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
If it doesn't work out, I would also be satisfied with an inheritance or voucher. Under certain circumstances, I might even find a buyer for the furniture.
Only for goods that I don't need, spending over 1,000 euros is quite a bit.
I have just received my delivery and I would have liked to know if screws were included as part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS\_ORG mirror (door) on the intended hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status?
Iran is making progress in talks on nuclear deal According to Iranian reports, progress is being made in talks to revive the international nuclear deal.
"Both sides are about to agree on the agenda items to be discussed", said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday to the news agency Irna. This is a "positive and important development", because initially there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons. The Vienna talks were resumed on Thursday after a brief interruption of almost a week to revive the agreement.
At the negotiations, negotiators from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France, and Russia are participating. There is also a US delegation in Vienna, but it is only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia overtakes Saxony - federal state now has highest coronavirus incidence Thuringia has overtaken Saxony and currently has the highest incidence nationwide.
As the only federal state, the value is above the mark of 1000. As the only federal state, Thuringia had the coronavirus incidence above the mark of 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day incidence rate of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Saxony, which had previously consistently shown the highest incidence rate nationwide, the value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia slightly decreased, but was still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths related to infection were reported in one day.
20 patients with severe Covid-19 were treated with intensive medical care on Sunday in hospitals. There may be delays in reporting on weekends.
In addition, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the recording of new cases.
I understand. As the delivery will only take place at the beginning of March, it might be possible by then.
I have to print this out and stick it on the package and drop it off at the post office, right? Do I not need to click or fill anything else in?
I want to avoid exactly that, which is why I am writing to you. I would like to kindly request that you allow me to cover the cost of the return shipping.
"An 8 euro return fee is, in my opinion, an audacity."
It's time for changes ###MBundestag greetings to you, I am u/StratorDE in the plenary hall in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
What is the point of this post? If you take a look at the activity in the past months of the German Bundestag, you can see one thing: it is not existent.
We have come into a winter drought and have extended the summer hole for a few months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what's the matter? Most likely it's just due to dissatisfaction with how some things have gone and how we generally stand.
In recent days, it has become apparent that many people here still have a strong desire for the German federal election. #What we need to change
At this point, the community around the German federal parliament is asked which wants to keep it alive. The impetus came from u/edizVEVO, who in the last few days became aware of this project and found a, to put it simply, pile of shards.
After some back and forth, several people from the community have expressed an interest in rebuilding the project. However, I would like to expressly call on everyone again to participate, only with everyone's involvement can this project have a future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server through this link.
Goals: * How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing arrangements need to be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we present ourselves to the outside world in the future?
* How can new members be recruited? * How can we create a fair election system?
I am fairly certain that I have forgotten quite a bit, but it's not a big deal. We can discuss and decide on the future democratically on the Discord at the end of the day. If you have the time and interest, come to the Discord, work with us, and let's decide on the future together.
I have ordered a lamp shade from you, which is still being delivered. Now I see that the article is too large/bulky for it and is not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different hanging from you.
I put it together and noticed it then when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it.
I hope that this is returned and I have a full refund. This is also quite sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: Does the #PRS\_ORG# daily towel come in a larger size, such as 240/240, for example?
#PRS\_ORG# must be able to guarantee me that the defective wardrobe will be picked up promptly. And I kindly request that you arrange this now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup. They must clarify with #PRS\_ORG# how this will work. #PRS\_ORG# can contact me at any time by phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction manual for assembly? How much time do I have to arrange this and decide on the return?
How do you respond to the question of why you are vegan? Today I had a conversation with a colleague that I really like.
She herself has lived vegetarian for a while, currently also rarely eats meat. I myself was also a vegetarian for several years.
Upon being asked if I had always wanted to be vegan, and if vegetarianism had been a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly without much thought. Specifically, I used to think that being a vegetarian would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately be supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. In that moment, I had the impression that disapproval arose on their side, then she defended vegetarianism and said she knew where her meat came from and that as a vegetarian, animal suffering is reduced.
Now I'm wondering if my answer to "plump" was too simple? How do you answer the question?
I have the feeling that as a vegan, one is quickly put in a corner and conflicts arise without one even noticing it. It greets a vegan who loves harmony.
This does not constitute an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code. Your #PRS\_ORG# does not exempt you from the legal requirements for distance selling.
I will not be able to collect my return at the designated location on the assigned date, as I will be unable to attend due to a funeral. Unfortunately, this cannot be changed.
Can I please be assigned an alternative pickup time. From 01.02.#NUMBER# onwards, I will be available consistently.
Lahnsteiner flood defense prepared: 45,000 euro subsidy from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate  Recently, Rhineland-Palatinate Interior Minister Roger Lewentz presented a subsidy of 45,000 euros in Lahnstein Town Hall to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte for the new water rescue equipment vehicle of the Volunteer Fire Brigade Lahnstein.
The total cost of the vehicle, which has been in operation since November 2020, amounted to 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in security.
"I am pleased that the state of Rhineland-Palatinate is supporting us in this," says the mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte. The device is used by the Lahnstein diving team, one of a total of seven units in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Above and underwater, they perform tasks in water and ice rescue as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, they permanently count on increasing deployments: The boom in hotel ship traffic on the Rhine and Moselle, as well as the further increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of and then the problems started. I can't open the book.
Following their recommendations, I have synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, but it has not worked. I am frustrated because the whole process has cost me a lot of time and I hope for help now.
Alright then, I would like to order 3 articles from the #PRS\_ORG# collection for June.
Can I enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you first of all for taking the time to address this issue. I too have spent almost a decade in public service in a similar capacity, i.e., we were both armed personnel in the executive branch. I don't want to go into this any further! I find the question of right and left to be very oversimplified.
Generally speaking, one should say that a civil servant is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone. Of course, it should also be clear to everyone that people in uniforms and weapons may be attracted to the right politically, and that these people may have difficulty dealing with the lived reality, which is also clear. After all, you now have not only the average white person, but also many Germans with a migration background, women, and homosexuals (and by that I don't mean the overly stereotypical cliché gays, because there are hardly any of those in the executive branch, but rather normal men and women whom you don't notice unless they tell you), and on these people I can and must rely. After all, in doubt, they will save your life or put it at risk for you.
But even these fringe groups, although it may sound strange at first, in my experience, represent a conservative stance, that is, they are proud of Germany and feel less comfortable with overly left-wing policies, even if these policies claim to speak for them or think they have the right to do so, they simply want to be treated normally. Returning to the right, of course, you will also find extreme right-wingers there, who are allowed to openly express their opinions and even openly devise dangerous plans for the state, which is completely exaggerated and annoys me as well.
Of course, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been on foreign deployment, begin to generalize and also say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences. Also, it happens that right-wing sympathizers certainly meet and engage in lively thought exchange.
Nevertheless, this is well combated in my opinion and also countered with political education and enlightenment! Germany is so deeply involved internationally and that, in my opinion, is good because we cannot afford to have actual racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, I don't understand what this is about. I have also ordered the other basket from Germany. Why would it come from England?
When I ordered, it was not sold out. I had already ordered in November.
However, it was confirmed to me in your order confirmation.
It's still about my order that is no longer deliverable. I previously chatted with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could the other #PRS\_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# euros in black still be delivered to Germany for #NUMBER# euros, or is this basket available in Germany somewhere else? I always only find you as a partner company.
But at the edge of the wooden part there are two deep grooves that have been filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself there is a small scratch.
Ordinary by child? Hello, I (w32) have been dealing with something for a while now.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (I am self-employed, have very little free time), but I have always struggled to keep my household clean and tidy on a permanent basis. There are always phases in which everything is left lying around, and sometimes it gets to me and I clean up.
But it's actually never really "that someone could come to visit spontaneously". My husband (unfortunately) isn't any better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time the household just loses against work and reluctance.
The kitchen will be cleaned most regularly because we like to cook. Now to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your child?
We don't have one yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been occupying me for longer. Because for me, I have no motivation, it simply doesn't bother me so much, as long as no visitor comes and, for example, there is always fresh clothing there and the kitchen is usable.
Does having a child serve as a greater motivation or do you remain sloppy? I'm looking forward to your answers.
"Exclusive, new, and high-quality anatomically pre-shaped cut, offers a maximum of comfort, perfect fit, and allows for almost unrestricted mobility. Pre-shaping with special, deeper engraving at the joints for improved mobility (at arm and knee bends)."
For the Focea Comfort 4, the covered area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to increase comfort even further. Smooth stretch panels at the joints reduce friction (armpits, elbows, and knees).
High-quality pre-shapes in the lower back area and in the thighs ensure a close-fitting, perfect seat. The Elaskin 8.8 Stretch Panel in the lumbar vertebrae area increases flexibility around the back zipper and improves comfort, especially when bending and when mounting and adjusting equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone located around the shoulders and on the back guarantees increased flexibility during arm and back movements. Fireskin is a warm, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high level of cold protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings warmth to a sensitive area of the body. A seamless, thin (-2 mm) seal on the face at the helmet increases comfort, sealing, and durability (separate helmet).
The soft, collar-located zone improves the sealing with a finely adjustable width adjustment by a flexible, gentle-closing clasp that does not adhere to the lining or seams. Double-layered cuffs with zippers connect a detachable inner lining with a soft, padded neoprene outer lining.
45° pre-curved seam at the end of the inner cuff for increased elasticity and load-bearing capacity when putting on. Long ripstop zipper at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort at the overall without hood.
Long back zipper (overall without hood) with metal slider and built-in water dam system for improved sealing (Beuchat patent) zippers on arms and legs.
Reinforcements at all ends of the tear releases to prevent tearing in case excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels glued flush with outer and inner overlapping.
Edges of the outer flanges beveled for greater load capacity Edges of the inner flanges indented for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer at its place, especially for deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common wrist-mounted computers).
Career in social work - as someone with an insecure personality disorder? I have completed an education in software development and have been out of college for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I am realizing more and more that this profession is not right for me, which is why I have been considering starting over and studying social work for some time now. The problem: I have a self-doubting (or avoidant) personality disorder (AVPS).
In simpler terms, this means that I lack self-esteem and am therefore shy. I have no problem speaking on a factual level with people, but it is very difficult for me to lead casual conversations and I have been told several times that I come across as unapproachable (although I believe this has improved).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
But I don't know if the concrete workday is really like I imagine it, and it's difficult to find something about it on the internet. The AVPS is already causing problems in my job (for me emotionally), because it brings me down every time there's something to criticize about my code ("I've messed up again with the simplest things") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should really know how to do this by now"/"I'm holding him back with my dumb questions"/"He must really think I'm underprivileged" etc.).
I will probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Have you already received the sofa back? Because there was no confirmation for that either.
I am waiting for a pick-up appointment. What do they mean by "return please"?
When I download a book from #PRS\_ORG#, the message "Your #PRS\_ORG# does not authorize this book" appears. Is there a problem?
I was in a chat with #PRS\_ORG#, who asked me if I received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein taken in with the food (protein) is broken down by the bird in its digestive tract into individual protein building blocks (amino acids) and builds its own body proteins from these again, which it also needs for feather formation. Feather formation in nestling and feather regeneration in the moulting bird are extremely complex processes and are closely connected with a particularly high strain on the animal's entire organism.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may cause disturbances in the breeding process. After this brief administration of NEKTON-Bio, it should be resumed with the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral supplement).

1 gram NEKTON-Bio in 250 ml water or 100 grams soft food. It is recommended to prepare only as much drinking water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/food daily.
In a marked measuring spoon (included), 1 g of NEKTON-Bio corresponds to. At the beginning of strong feather damage, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the onset of feather regrowth is visible.
According to this, the normal dose should be administered until the feather formation is completely finished. Storage: NEKTON-Bio should be stored dry, without sunlight, at a temperature between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair is sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That is really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order arrived damaged and I attached some pictures. Have you received this email?
Statement of a community member in conflict with the bylaws Hello r/LegaladviceGerman
I have the following problem. A walnut tree on our property is to be felled.
A request has also been made to the municipality. An employee writes to me that the felling of fruit trees, including walnut trees, is not part of the bylaws.
In the bylaws, the walnut tree is explicitly mentioned as a protected tree. Can I now rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On one hand, I must rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the bylaws are clear.
I thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any message, well, I still have a sofa that hasn't been used.
Could you offer me a discount or voucher? What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that, the question is just whether I can pay in euros and have the cover shipped to Germany. Can you check that?
Notification: Serious traffic accident on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg has occurred recently.
According to the current police press release (14:03), a car has come into the oncoming traffic while overtaking, resulting in injuries.
Alright, I understand. Good, thank you again that it was so easy!
Merry Christmas to you too! Here are some ideas and opportunities for further career development.
My Christmas is unfortunately not very good, because my dear head is currently thinking about everything that can be thought about. Before I now dig out ... briefly: I need advice and preferably from people who know my situation - that is, from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a newcomer. Originally, I studied something else and also worked in a field there (to remain at least a little anonymous, I don't want to mention anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could be more fun for me. At some point, I ended up in teaching and was sure that was it - even though the framework conditions were significantly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that didn't matter to me.
I have now arrived at my third "I Google other job postings". It has only been half a year.
Before the colors, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the underpainting, then I can still change afterwards. But right now, I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I am completely exhausted. Now there are holidays, but there is still a lot of work waiting for me.
Before the exam, I always thought I was stress-resistant, but there my weekend was my weekend and my weekend was my weekend. There I was free.
And the stress at work was irrelevant in those moments. Now, even the family celebration is too stressful for me.
And then there are these rigid structures that additionally annoy me. Basically, it's fun and from an external perspective, the REF also runs well in terms of feedback and so on.
But I'm completely exhausted and I'm wondering how much stress my body can handle before it completely seals off - if it's not already doing so. I'm wondering if I want to have this for the rest of my working life - especially when I read some of your contributions - or if I should go back to the old area where I was valued, could take free time when I needed it, and although I found the work a bit boring, it was appropriately paid and we worked together as a team, not just as a lone fighter like it is most of the time now.
But then I ask myself if I won't be back in the same place a year from now, feeling just as unsatisfied as I do now. You understand, it's all a bit confusing, but maybe you as outsiders have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, which I'm completely done with and start crying at the slightest thought of it.
I will not make emotional decisions at the moment, that probably leads to nothing good. But maybe your opinions will help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to be able to enjoy Christmas, that's enough for me for now.
Thank you for reading and I apologize for the whiny tone from me. I hope my situation has become at least a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and Amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers maintain an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier.
This is based partly on real analog circuits, because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a sealed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance upgrade of the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. From the portable VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers. The losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it will not be enough for victory against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven assists from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104:106 to the Los Angeles Clippers on Saturday.
The main compartment is also adaptable: with three individually placeable and foldable Klett-closure fasteners, it adapts completely to the needs of your photo equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless systems of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras. Ultimately, what fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible equipment would be a DSLR camera with an attached lens, two to three interchangeable lenses, and an external flash. Larger DSLM cameras such as the various models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can store a lot of accessories. And if you have a small mirrorless camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E series), you can use the backpack for your equipment and non-photo items.
Drone pilots also make an optimal choice with the Everyday Backpack 20L, as the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: possibly longest in history In the nearly three months since the start of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma since Sunday is the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 for 84 days was considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased in recent days, but volcanologists are not making any predictions about when it might end. The indicators suggest a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the president of the island council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV broadcaster RTVE. Damages in the millions.
In the last three months since the eruption began, the over 1000°C hot lava has destroyed almost 2900 residential buildings and other structures, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares have been covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1,700 soccer fields. More than 7,000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be over 900 million euros.
Off the coast, two new landings were created by cooled lava, with a total size of about 50 hectares. The banana cultivation, which is immensely important for the island and on which about half of the approximately 85,000 inhabitants depend directly or indirectly, was particularly affected. The banana cultivation was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
25 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed, and other areas were heavily affected, according to the newspaper "El País".
Christmas and the gifts Christmas stands at the door and especially the children can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree, combined with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, have something tempting about them. Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still hold together our increasingly divided society.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the gesture of giving, which according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss was a "peace-building social contract of natural peoples," can escape the rigid routine and be filled with life again in the context of this tradition, as Nicholas became the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who associated Christmas with gift-giving to a great extent. Prior to that, gifts were given on St. Nicholas Day in some way or another.
The background of this still popular custom today is that Saint Nicholas, as bishop of Myra, threw three women secretly gold into their window at night to save them from a life of sin. From this unconventional way of giving, the popular German custom of filling children's shoes, especially with gifts, emerged.
Protestants object to this custom because they reject the role of mediator between God and humans as "saint veneration". For these reasons, they distance themselves from the institution.
Martin Luther turned St. Nicholas into the Christ Child and thus established a new tradition. The focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas Eve.
As most Protestants no longer see such details as such, it only irritates the fewest that the custom of St. Nicholas is still a firm part of the pre-Christmas period, similar to the Martin's custom with Martin's singing and Martin's procession. Today, you can find everything from socks to coveted luxury watches under the Christmas tree and at the door in shoes, as long as it is desired by the heart.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries evidence a tradition of giving since the 13th century on St. Nicholas Day.
With the Reformation, the day of giving shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian-influenced countries, there is a joyful muddle over the question of who now brings gifts to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the respective region whether the Christ Child appears on Christmas Eve or the Christmas Man, who is essentially a kind of Nicholas, to whom some characteristics have been assigned over time. These include, for example, his white bushy beard, which has little in common with the rather strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas. In Spain, it is the Three Wise Men who give the gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown the Three Wise Men the way to the Christ Child.
In Scandinavia, sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia, it was Father Frost who brought some fame. Here, it is not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sled as a troika.
In the Czech Republic, the birthplace of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, the Christ Child is responsible for the gift-giving.

I bought another e-book.
I requested a return shipping label last week and this morning for my order #NUMBER. I was told that one will be sent to me.
As I have not received any yet (also not in the SPAM folder), I would like to inquire now how long this usually takes. Thank you very much.
Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace In the vicinity of Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot and killed by police on Saturday.
The police reported that a man had been reported to have entered a bank and a bookmaker's business with a weapon. The man fled, according to authorities, in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
There were shots fired, and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene of the crime.
The police did not believe it to be of a terrorist background. In the vicinity of Kensington Palace, there are several embassies located.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also reside there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I will be redirected to your page immediately.
The decorative lamp fits harmoniously into any flower bed, garden area, or rock garden. The lamp is simply placed and can be anchored in the ground with 2 earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery. Maximum brightness duration of up to 10 hours.
The sturdy plastic version is suitable for outdoor use all year round. In the Hollywood spectacle, it is usually objects from distant galaxies that are portrayed as threatening and internally glowing in color.
Quite harmless is "Smart Stone": The sun alone ensures that this solar lamp shines fascinatingly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The rounded, amorphous design was deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself during the day.
His organic curves fit into any natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn, or in the rock garden. He also does well in neighborhoods with larger gravel and boulders, where he manages to assert himself thanks to his size.
You can save big on preparation work: "Smart Stone" does not require any wiring or batteries as a solar light. Simply place the "Light Stone" in a sunny spot during the day.
Two delivered earth augers ensure a firm grip when needed. The matte white plastic shell itself is robust and weather-resistant.
Its solar module discreetly conceals "Smart Stone" inside, along with its battery and two LEDs - one for white light, the other for colored light. The battery charges when sunlight falls on the housing.
As dusk begins to fall, "Smart Stone" starts to glow automatically; you can choose the color yourself - there are six attractive light colors to choose from, in addition to daylight white. The power is also automatically turned off when the battery charge level drops to a predetermined minimum or when it gets bright again.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew from the beginning the next day.
I have already done this several times, it doesn't work.

Pillenproblem  Hallo liebes Weibsvolk,  ich hoffe, dass es euch gut geht. Heute möchte ich mit euch über ein wichtiges Thema sprechen: das Pillenproblem.  Für viele Frauen ist die Verwendung von Pillen ein wichtiger Bestandteil ihres Lebens. Sie helfen dabei, den Menstruationszyklus zu regulieren, Schutz vor ungewollter Schwangerschaft zu bieten und auch andere gesundheitliche Vorteile zu bieten.  Leider gibt es jedoch auch einige Nachteile, die mit der Verwendung von Pillen einhergehen können. Einige Frauen berichten über Nebenwirkungen wie Gewichtszunahme, Stimmungsschwankungen, Kopfschmerzen und Müdigkeit.  Deshalb ist es wichtig, dass wir uns über die verschiedenen Optionen im Kopf haben, wenn es um die Verwendung von Pillen geht. Es gibt verschiedene Arten von Pillen, die unterschiedliche Nebenwirkungen haben können. Es ist wichtig, dass wir mit unserem Arzt spre
I hope I'm doing this right, is this actually my first post on Reddit after a year? To my problem: I had to start taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such incredibly bad period pains and premenstrual syndrome before my period.
Now I would like to keep this as it is, because I already have to take enough medication due to chronic illnesses that I cannot choose. My main problem, surprisingly not the pain, but my skin.
I had suddenly gotten about 100 explosion-like pimples all over my body after a roughly two-year break from 0, and they were everywhere. So superficially, but it bothered me quite a bit and I didn't feel well.
In the two-year break, it never really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips to avoid this this time.
Unscented and odor-free is my cosmetics already, but perhaps someone can recommend something to me. Unfortunately, the gynecologist did not take me seriously and the dermatologist appointment is still to come.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, love is such a thing.
Had severe neurodermatitis before, then a period of rest, then widespread knötchenflechte and the acne theme. I have also tried everything in terms of diet in connection with the Christian disease and have remained on a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat, because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It can also be good that the worm is simply hormonal, but when you want to have construction sites everywhere like me, you might as well not want to look for anything else that might go wrong.
I had already written everything to her colleague, seminars and so on, and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered regarding my matter.
I always have to work and answer the phone, and suddenly it was all gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it. Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
But he is generally available in large print because it is available in large black letters.

In the name of the people: Laypeople render judgments in everyday clothing on the judge's bench in the courtroom.
But their judgment is crucial, even if they don't wear a robe: lay judges determine, together with professional judges, whether and for how long someone goes to jail. Two of them report in a conversation with the "public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher District Court: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the District Court on John-F.-Kennedy-Street.
Hello, unfortunately, I cannot access my customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the email address provided above?
"Can we dispose of the packaging material? We cannot keep it for so long."
We would use the table as offered as if it were ours.
Sure, had already ordered the same chair in blue in November and also received it. Therefore, because they are so beautiful, I now wanted to get one in gray.
Must the wardrobe be completely disassembled for collection and refund? And when would the collection be?
A 10 kV underground cable will be newly built in 2022. The permission for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria's plan approval decision paves the way for the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk now.
The approximately seven-kilometer-long earth cable will connect the transformer station Tann in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected near the Edermanning village at Reut to a mast of the overhead line.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived partially with us so far.
The blue betsell number: #PRS\_ORG# with the shipment number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS\_ORG# with the remark "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the process will continue now? Have a nice start to the week!
"You can forget that, I already explained it several times yesterday! This is a glass commode and all the sides are bulging out, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is damaged."
The commode is in my apartment and the #PRS\_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment due to the #PRS\_ORG# regulations. This means that the commode cannot be collected because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request was made to #PRS\_ORG#, as it seems to be a general problem.
Lesson Plan (EK) Hello dear colleagues,
I have been working at the Ref since summer, and teaching is fun for me, but I currently have major problems with time-efficiently planning my lessons in the subject of geography. Unfortunately, my school is not technically equipped at all, so I basically only have the blackboard, the textbook, and an overhead projector as media to use.
At school, I can also only copy black and white for free (which is annoying for geography). I currently just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently dealing with the topic of geographical factors, and for me, every hour stands for itself. In principle, the methods repeat themselves, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I always start planning by thinking about the learning goal (what I want to achieve) and then consider how I can build it up (usually I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We have the book Terra and I am not satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the work sheets. Perhaps a geography teacher can show me how to work efficiently with the book.
I would really appreciate it.
I would like to return the #PRS\_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#. I have actually already decided on a new one at #PRS\_ORG#, but I would like to handle the return as quickly as possible.
Retail fears Christmas business due to the 2G rule. In most stores, only those who have been vaccinated or recovered may enter.
The trade considers this unnecessary and regrets the decline in sales. It also has a possible solution ready.
The 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Retail Association (HDE) to the retail trade. Umsatzeinbrüche for articles of non-daily needs are to be lamented, criticized HDE-Chief Executive Officer Stefan Genth.
According to a current survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70 percent of companies looked negatively at the remaining days of the year. Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless hole," said Genth. Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost a third of their pre-crisis turnover in the past week.
It only runs well in retail and online. The association is calling for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe matter, said the CEO. "2G during shopping does not advance us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations were scaring off customers and requiring high personnel effort. He demanded that the ribbon rule must be approved nationwide.
According to this, each customer would only need to be checked once for 2G (vaccinated or recovered) and would receive a wristband that day granting them access to all businesses. In addition, spot checks should be sufficient in retail, just as they are in public transport for the 3G rule (vaccinated, recovered, or tested).
Even the real estate conglomerate Deutsche Euroshop specializing in shopping centers spoke of difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were last at around 75 percent of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and sales at around 90 percent.
"These numbers will now fall right in the middle of the important Christmas business," said CEO Wilhelm Wellner to "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personnel and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, can present their 2G proof once at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to a club hotel, can enter all shops undisturbed." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS\_ORG#. The mirror has a scratch and the frame also has a defect that was attempted to be covered up with a yellow filler.
That looks ugly. I would like to return the mirror and have already repackaged and sealed it again.
How should I proceed with the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high color reproduction. A modern microprocessor with extraordinary capabilities takes care of the setting of the color temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to adjusting the brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually set and store the color temperature in the range of 3100-5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is easy and intuitively operable.
The lamp produces a very high light output with soft, high-quality light that is completely flicker-free. The 120-degree emission angle allows you to illuminate large areas with relatively little distance, making it excellent.
By the way, it is also suitable for reporter situations in small rooms or short distances. You can practically adjust the brightness without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool for working both on set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows for remote control of the light in television studios or when the light is mounted in hard-to-reach places.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
Additionally, there is a slot there for NP-F Akkus (not included in the delivery) User memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To perform the settings of individual settings on the memory locations, simply press and hold one of the memory buttons for a longer period of time. The memory controller stores the current state of the lamp when turned off, so that when turned on again, the familiar situation is restored - very practical for studio work, for example, when the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with battery is one of the greatest strengths of the DL3120 functionality. This results from the ability to operate with cost-effective NP-F batteries. These are often already in the possession of photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL312 can also check before the set whether the batteries have enough power - there is a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, a value is displayed in both display indicators (the left battery in the upper display, the right battery in the lower display). In addition, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the headlight with current using the included power supply.
The construction of the flashlight is very simple. You have a 16mm mount for attachment, so you can directly attach it to your tripod.
The inclination is reliably adjusted using sensors on both sides. Attention has been paid to ensure that the mechanical components are of extremely high quality and are therefore designed for durability and heavy-duty use.
Additionally, a neck joint is included in the scope of delivery. It's great that a bag is also included in the scope of delivery.
This way, you can transport or store the lamp with all the accessories you might want to buy without any problems.
Sorry, I got a gift that is too small :(.
"Party, which we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after scoring a comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a row winless Hesse seemed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga debacle. But then the SGE turned it around, got rid of their frustration over a mixed start to the season within an hour, and won furiously with 5:2. "It's crazy what the guys did today," coach Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and gave a "blanket praise" to everyone involved.
At first, it looked like another setback for Frankfurt, who were still trailing behind their expectations in ninth place. Patrik Schick had put Leverkusen ahead 2-0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE coach. "How the players then came back and put on a fantastic performance", said Glasner further.
I am extremely happy with the performance we have shown and of course with the result. Even defender Christopher Lenz, who returned to the pitch for the first time since the fourth matchday and overcame his muscle injury, emphasized the team's morale.
"I believe our mentality is incredible", said the 27-year-old and looked forward to the result, especially for the viewers. That was the party we wanted to throw today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus within himself, but he is also well-prepared in terms of the personnel situation. It is extraordinary that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
It is top work in our medical department, but the players also live a highly professional lifestyle. Now one wants to "go step by step and remain humble" and carry out the tasks until the end of the year "at this level".
Next up is an away game on Wednesday as part of the English week, against Borussia Mönchengladbach (18:30, Sky).
I received the email that my package is being returned to you due to an error on my part. I tried to call #PRS\_ORG# to have it redirected, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is refunded and the order is placed again? Unfortunately, this would mean that I cannot order again because it has already taken a very long time.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS\_ORG# chairs?
Damper for women's handball before the quarterfinals against Spain. Germany's women's handball team sneak off the court with hanging heads and empty looks after the humiliation against Denmark.
To conclude the main round of the World Cup, the German national handball team suffered a crushing 16:32 (8:13) defeat in front of 800 spectators in Granollers and must now face hosts Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were much too timid and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
Against Spain, we need to adopt a different approach. After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany finished Group III of the main round with 8:2 points as runners-up behind the Danes (10:0).
It's unfortunate that we couldn't bring the flow with us. That was a bad game from everyone that we have to erase, said captain Emily Bölk.
In the fight for a place in the semi-finals, there must be a clear improvement against the runner-up of the 2019 World Cup on the coming Tuesday, in order to keep alive the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007. The best German thrower in the duel with the three-time Olympic champion Denmark was backcourt player Alina Grijseels with six goals.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack nor in defense," admitted defender Xenia Smits and demanded: "We now need to quickly look forward." From front to back, we were not up to par.
Unlike in the previous five tournament games, the German team was not at the level with the start. Missed shots and technical errors in attack and gaps in defense were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Only goalkeeper Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented something worse with a few parades. The first goal of the DHB team came after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully finished a quick counterattack.
The hoped-for initial spark was not this, however. Against the aggressive defense of the Danish women, the German women could hardly assert themselves on the pitch - and when they did, they mostly failed against the strong Althea Reinhardt in the Danish team's goal.
The game was called off early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since defender Mia Zschocke was sent off shortly after a hard foul on her opponent and saw a red card. However, she will be allowed to participate in the quarterfinals.
Only in the final phase of the first half did the German national team come a bit better into the game and at least managed to score five goals until halftime. The already faint hope of a comeback after the break was gone after just seven minutes at 9:19.
Once again, the Greens' protégés sinned in all areas and made it easy for the well-prepared opponent, who is now among the medal contenders. As a result, the German team was unable to catch up with their performance improvement and left the field as a clear loser.
DACH-Adventskalender Day 6: Family traditions in the Christmas season As part of the Reddit Advent calendar, we have managed to secure the Nicholas Day and use this as an opportunity to dedicate ourselves to family traditions in the pre-Christmas period, Advent, St. Nicholas Day, Christmas Eve, and the Christmas holidays.
How was it back then at home? How about with your\*r partner\*in?
Would you like to pass on your traditions to your children? What is most beautiful for children?
"Stiefelputzen?" "Plätzchenbacken?"  Translation:  "Stiefelputzen?" "Plätzchenbacken?"  Meaning:  "Stiefelputzen?" and "Plätzchenbacken?" are two separate questions in German.  "Stiefelputzen?" means "shoe shining?" in English.  "Plätzchenbacken?" means "cookie baking?" in English.
Decorating trees? Playing music?
Does the Christmas man, the Christ Child, or is the gift actually from Grandma and Grandpa? Regardless, everyone puts in the effort to make it as beautiful as possible as a family during and around Christmas.
Whether they are now established traditions or something different every year: tell us how it goes in your family!
Please send me any transaction number... or anything else that could help with the confirmation of the transfer... etc.
I would like to check the availability of a discount code, similar to #PRS\_ORG# gift vouchers.
What about them?
The title is there, I am a vaccinating physician in mobile vaccination teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine is administered in nursing homes. As these will soon be largely completed, it will then continue in part to vaccination centers for me.
I am happy to answer questions without a time limit regarding the organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, provided that they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, does it interact with the vaccination..."). In my area of responsibility, this includes providing information about the vaccination, determining the indication (the person has a right to be vaccinated according to the Corona vaccination regulation and there are no reasons against it), medical documentation, and if necessary, providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (which has never happened to me).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical auxiliaries. In vaccination teams, however, we often have no nurses there, but only (thank goodness no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical technicians for the preparation of the vaccine, who cannot (may not?) perform vaccinations, so that I also perform most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Huidlerer" question: Amberger knows the solution. What exactly is a "Huidlerer"?
With this dialect word, sent in by someone from Amberg, the BR television program "We in Bavaria" has caused intense reflection. However, unlike on many previous days, the term remained unnoticed in the "Host mi?" series by the callers this time.
No, it was not a "person who is nervous". And also not one who "must everything happen quickly".
As, heard the people from the TV presenter, is completely wrong. The man from Amberg provided the solution and thus probably also caused astonishment among many people in the Upper Palatinate.
"The Huidler", the viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven". Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been consulted as an expert by Bavarian Television for years, confirmed this.
With the remark that this is a typical Upper Palatinate term, derived somehow from the more well-known dialect word "Houdern". Thus, a gap in education was closed - probably also for many who have lived in the Amberg area for a long time.
I haven't been able to buy any books for two weeks now. Every time I get a confirmation, I get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have restarted the #PRS\_ORG# device, connected it to the computer, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing helped.
Tyre choice for racing bikes - really that safe from punctures? This morning I woke up full of motivation to train a little in preparation for my upcoming bike tour.
Well, said and done, and I rode my racing bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay. The first 40km were really nice - but then it happened, what lurks in every city center (this time: thanks Krefeld!).
Glass shards on the track. Zack, loud hissing and my rear tire refused to participate in the rest of the journey in any way.
As I couldn't really get a replacement jacket and inner tube on account of the day of the week, I had to turn around again with a somewhat bad mood and take the first train back home. Then it wasn't technically so bad either, maybe it's even better if I practice the tire change again before the bike tour.
Now I am facing a question and I hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would extremely dislike to encounter this problem frequently.
Now it wasn't really that bad, as the old tires from the previous owner (very nice old man, who had driven 120km on them by the time I picked up the bike at 2pm!) were also described as suboptimal, because he had been riding on them for several more years. But when I think that I still have to change the tires after 80-90km of riding, I'm not in a good mood :D
I then got into a conversation with an older man at the platform, who asked me curiously why I didn't have the Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unflatable. Now the whole thing naturally sounds very tempting.
But are they really indestructible? I have little desire to spend 40€/tire now, only to be disappointed in the end.
Furthermore, I also ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my racing bike at the moment. There seems to be a wider size available (apparently?) with the Marathon Plus tires, but the majority are already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you recommend me to other tires for a racing bike in general?
The Swallow's page seems to recommend the Durano DD to my absolute! Thank you in advance for the help and love greetings!

Hello everyone, finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to well-known reasons, which has resulted in a higher planning effort and explains the short notice of the announcement. BUT: At least three people will be present via switch, so we will stream the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans and hopefully thousands of you will follow us!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic – nevertheless, we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
It will start around 0:30. Start getting your drinks cold, plan some good food, and get ready for a long but very interesting night.
