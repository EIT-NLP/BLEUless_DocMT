牵头发起申诉的亚裔教育联盟当天在华盛顿召开新闻发布会。该团体主席赵宇空在发布会上说，过去１０年里，符合美国名校录取条件的亚裔申请人数量成倍增长，但在这３所美国名校中，亚裔所占比例基本维持在同一水平。

 [/INST] The Asian Education League, which initiated an appeal, held a press conference in Washington, D.C. today.

 [/INST] According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Duke University have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota for Asian applicants of over 20 years.

2020年9月，陆先生从房屋中介了解到一处位于浙江余姚丈亭镇的厂房，在多次现场看房后，陆先生决定购买该厂房。同年12月，陆先生就购买厂房的细节与房屋所有权人的家属林某进行磋商后，于当天通过银行转账汇款20万元作定金。

 [/INST] In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory located in Xiangjiang Baluyao Xiangquan Town. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Li decided to purchase the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Li negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the owner of the house and their family, and on the same day, through bank transfer, he paid a down payment of 20,000 yuan.

林某在《厂房买卖定金收条》上作为收款人签名，其中载明，“若买方不想买此厂房，此定金归卖家，如卖方不愿意卖此厂房，定金将双倍返还卖方，双方约定一周内签订厂房买卖合同。”然而，之后双方因厂房出售范围、付款方式等主要合同条款未能形成一致意见，导致房屋买卖合同迟迟未能签订。

 [/INST] Lin Some signed the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the payee, clearly stating, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week." However, after that, the two parties could not reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the sale range and payment method, causing the factory purchase and sale contract to be delayed in signing.

考虑到双方未能就合同内容达成共识，几天后，林某将20万元定金退回给了陆先生。好不容易看中的房子，定金交了，房款也准备好了，就差“临门一脚”签合同，卖方却不卖了，这让陆先生无奈又愤怒。

 [/INST] Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin Some returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Luo First several days later. After seeing the house and paying the deposit, the rent was also prepared, but it was just missing "signing at the door" to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell it, which made Luo First helpless and angry.

为此，陆先生将林某起诉至余姚市人民法院。法院经审理认为，双方最终未能签订正式合同，不能仅归责于被告，应合理推定为磋商不成，故本案不应适用定金罚则，被告无需承担双倍返还定金的违约责任。

 [/INST] This is why Mr. Li sued Mr. Lin at the Yueyang People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it was not fair to hold only the defendant responsible. Instead, it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations failed, and this case should not be applied to the penalty for breach of contract. The defendant should not be held responsible for returning double the penalty for breach of contract.

沙巴3200名新生婴儿无报生纸 因特制防伪纸断货（亚庇11日讯）沙巴国民登记局说，由于特制防伪纸存货用光，所以自10月初开始就无法颁发报生纸给初生婴儿，至今累积的受影响者达3200人。

 [/INST] According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on November 11th, the Sandba National Population Registration Office stated that due to the special anti-counterfeit paper being out of stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since October.

48小时核酸阴性、设“缓冲区 ” 国务院联防联控机制发文要求加强口岸城市疫情防控-新华网新华社北京12月11日电（记者董瑞丰、顾天成）国务院联防联控机制日前印发关于加强口岸城市新冠肺炎疫情防控工作的通知，要求近期离开陆地边境口岸城市（与香港、澳门有口岸相连的除外）人员需持有48小时内核酸检测阴性证明，前往陆地边境口岸城市人员抵达后至少进行1次核酸检测。

 [/INST] 48-hour negative nucleic acid test results, set "buffer zone" as the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism requires strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic in port cities - Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11, 2021 (Reporter Ni Ruifeng, Chu Tiansu) The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic in port cities recently. It is required that people who leave the land border ports in port cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) hold negative nucleic acid test results within 48 hours before arriving at the land border ports. After arriving at the land border ports, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

根据通知，上述要求的时间范围为，从各省区市确定口岸城市范围并公告之日起，至2022年3月15日。此外，通知还提出，有条件的口岸城市可研究在辖区内设置疫情防控缓冲区。

 [/INST] According to the notice, the time range for the above-mentioned requirements is from the date of determining the scope of the border cities within each province, municipality, and county, to March 15, 2022. Furthermore, the notice also states that, under certain conditions, border cities can be studied to set up a buffer zone for disease control within the jurisdiction.

国家卫生健康委疾病预防控制局有关负责人介绍，对于一些口岸城市来说，跨境边贸是当地主要经济支柱，双方边民往来频繁。实行分区差异化管理政策，由一道防控外溢防线变为两道防线，有望实现关口前移，压缩疫情外溢风险，以最小社会影响、最低社会成本实现疫情防控最大成效。

 [/INST] The introduction of responsible persons from the National Health and Welfare Commission of the People's Republic of China stated that for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. Implementing differential management policies based on regions, the prevention and control line has become two lines, which is expected to move the border closer, compress the risk of disease outbreak, and achieve the maximum effect of disease prevention with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.

 [/INST] Notice Requirement:

1. Strengthen the disease control mechanism of the border city.
2. Improve the health monitoring warning system.
3. Implement border control measures.
4. Enhance disease control in the border city.
5. Scientifically and precisely carry out disease control work.
6. Strengthen the defense line against external inputs.

The notice emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the research and deployment of disease control with the protection of people's livelihoods. It is necessary to publish and widely disseminate the hotline for people's livelihood protection, to conduct regular inspections of the supply of basic living materials and prices, and to promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public.

 [/INST] Most people will be afraid to make a change before the "转变" characters, hesitant and unwilling to take the first step; or they will make a hasty decision to change based on a momentary impulse, and take the first step bravely, but the good scenery is often short-lived, and they cannot persist for long before giving up. The classic "从明天开始" section of Ma San's famous "从明天开始" skit is the most famous portrayal of this "universal human nature."

“最好原则”的最大问题在于门槛太高，它往往超越了普通人的能力极限，让绝大多数人“望门兴叹 ” 。或许 ， “ 次好原则”才是一种有可能让更多普通人走上相对成功之路的途径。

 [/INST] "The principle of 'best' has the biggest problem, which is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limit of ordinary people's ability, making most people 'watch the door with excitement'. Perhaps, the 'second-best principle' is a kind of possible way for more ordinary people to walk up the relatively successful path."
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

“次好原则”的核心在于“降低门槛 ” — —它鼓励的是一种“积小胜为大胜”的理论，即如果做不到100，只做到1也行：因为1永远大于0；如果登不上泰山，只登上你家门口的小沙丘也行，因为那也总比原地踏步强。总之，只要你做了点什么，就总比不做强。

 [/INST] "The core principle of '次好原则' is to 'lower the threshold' - it encourages the idea of 'small victories leading to big victories', meaning that if you can't achieve 100, achieving 1 is still a victory: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your family's front door step is still a victory: because it's still better than staying put. In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing."
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

由于门槛大幅度降低，因此就多了使普通人做到坚持的可能性，而凡事只要坚持，成功概率也会加大。只不过遵循“次好原则”的成功之路，其路程略长一些而已。

 [/INST] Due to the significant reduction of the threshold, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as one persists. However, following the "second-best principle" success path may be slightly longer.

总而言之 ， “ 最好原则”尽管在表面上打着让所有人都成功的旗号，但它最终能够激励的，实际上还是少数；而“次好原则 ” ， 才能有效激励更多的人，尽可能地让更多人受益。

 [/INST] In summary, "the best principle" may have a flag that appears successful to everyone on the surface, but it can only truly motivate a few in reality. On the other hand, "the second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and bring more benefits to more people.

青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年增加0.71万吨-新华网新华社西宁12月11日电（记者骆晓飞、张宏祥）记者从青海省农业农村厅获悉，最新监测结果显示，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量今年较上年增加0.71万吨,达到10.85万吨，与2002年保护初期相比，累计增长40余倍。

 [/INST] According to the latest monitoring results, the amount of bare-headed goose resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 tons this year, reaching 10.85 tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection period in 2002.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

青海湖裸鲤俗名“湟鱼 ” ， 是青海湖中特有的珍贵鱼种，对维系青海湖流域“水-鱼-鸟”生态链安全和生物多样性有着举足轻重的作用。20世纪六七十年代，受人为大量捕杀、裸鲤繁殖水域环境日益退化等因素影响，青海湖裸鲤数量锐减，2002年青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量仅为2592吨。

 [/INST] The Chinese name for the bare-headed goose in the Qinghai Lake is "Tangyu." This is a rare and valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the "water-fish-bird" food chain in the Qinghai Lake ecosystem. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human factors such as overfishing and breeding of bare-headed goose, the environment of the breeding water domain began to deteriorate, leading to a sharp reduction in the number of bare-headed goose. In 2002, the resource reserve of bare-headed goose in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

2004年在《中国物种红色名录》中青海湖裸鲤被列为濒危物种。从2003年起，青海省实施封湖育鱼，禁止任何单位、集体和个人到青海湖及湖区主要河流及支流捕捞裸鲤，禁止销售裸鲤及其制品。

 [/INST] In 2004, the naked swan was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake breeding program, prohibiting any organization, group or individual from catching naked swans in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked swans and their products.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

与此同时，通过人工增殖放流以及清理青海湖主要入湖河流河道、设计科学合理的“过鱼通道”等措施持续加大保护力度，青海湖裸鲤资源蕴藏量逐年增加。青海省农业农村厅副厅长杨林介绍，截至目前，青海湖裸鲤已累计实施人工增殖放流近1.8亿尾，对青海湖裸鲤资源恢复的贡献率超过23 % 。

 [/INST] At the same time, through artificial breeding and flow release, as well as cleaning the main inlet rivers of the Qinghai Lake, designing scientifically reasonable "passageways for fish" and other measures, the protection degree of Qinghai Lake has been continuously increased. Yang Lin, the deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, more than 1.8 billion tails of Qinghai Lake sturgeon have been implemented through artificial breeding and flow release, and the contribution rate to the recovery of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources exceeds 23%.

 [/INST] The Qinghai-Three-Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source supply area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the westward expansion of aridization towards the east. To protect the ecological environment of the Three-Rivers Source Area and the water domain of Qinghai Lake, protect the wild animals and plants in the water, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in recent years, Qinghai has successively issued fishing prohibition notices for the key water domains of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

一个想分享个人经历的编程小白。如果是打算在这一行业入行倒是可以选择去找一个地方进行培训，但如果没这方面的想法的话，最好还是自学的好，毕竟培训要花的钱是非常多的，而且还要用6个月的时间去学习。

 [/INST] A beginner programmer who wants to share their personal experiences. If you plan to enter the industry, it is recommended to find a place for training, but if you don't have any ideas, it is best to self-study. Training requires a lot of money and takes 6 months to learn.

但如果是打算在这一行业入坑的话培训确实是非常不错的选择，尤其是那些自制力及其弱的人，培训更是非常好的选择。要是自身自制力比较强的话也可以选择自学，只不过会比较累。

 [/INST] However, if the intention is to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is even a better choice. If one's self-discipline is relatively strong, one can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

当然选择一个好的培训机构是非常重要的事情。首先要看这个机构的师资力量，如果师资力量不够强大的话，这个培训机构就没有什么意义了，当然一些新开的培训机构师资力量都不是特别强。

 [/INST] Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the teacher resources of this institution. If the teacher resources are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course some new opening training institutions teacher resources are not particularly strong.

其次在选择之前打探一下这个培训机构，最好可以打探一下这个机构出来的学生，毕竟只有机构的学生才知道这个机构到底怎么样，讲解的课程是好或者不好。你好，其实你这个问题问的我也不知道怎么回答，因为对于你自身的情况并没有做一定的介绍，而学习这个东西和个人自身的情况有很大的关系的。

 [/INST] Next, you should explore this training institution before making a decision. It's best to explore the students who have graduated from this institution to get a better understanding of this institution. After all, only the students of this institution can truly tell you about the quality of the courses taught here. Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have enough information about your personal situation. Learning this thing is closely related to your personal situation.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

比如专业、年龄、想学习的语言，甚至在哪个城市，这些都会和你学习或者想要从事的行业有关系的。如果你是学生的话并且还没有毕业，或者是计算机专业的已经毕业的，那么如果时间充足我个人建议自学，这个是效率和成本最低的，现在很多的线下线上的培训机构其实也很不错，但是一学习成本高，二投入的时间比较多，基本需要集中培训3-6个月。

 [/INST] For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to study or work in are all related to the industry you want to pursue. If you are a student who has not graduated yet or have graduated in computer science, and you have enough time, my personal suggestion is to self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are many good offline and online training institutions, but the cost is high, and the investment of time is quite a lot. It usually takes 3-6 months to complete the training.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但是如果是我说的这些情况的话，自学就很方便，现在网络上的很多学习资源都是免费的，或者去b站也有很多的培训资源，如果你不会找资源，你也可以通过简介联系到我，获取免费的资源，或者详细的咨询也行。另外还有一些比较经典的书籍可以结合视频综合学习。

 [/INST] However, if I were to speak of these situations, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources available on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili to find training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources, or you can also get detailed consultations. Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

如果你不是计算机专业的，但是也能够支付一定的学习金钱和时间成本，那么建议去培训机构学习，这样学习不用很费劲，老师讲解的也很详细，有问题也有人专门解答，另外在学习规划或者监督方面也有帮助。而且现在很多的培训机构都会签就业协议，有内推名额，学习之后推荐去公司，这样后面找工作的面试环节也能够省不少事情。

 [/INST] If you are not a computer major but are willing to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution. This way of learning is not very expensive, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help in planning and monitoring. Moreover, many training institutions now sign job placement agreements, have internal recommendations, and recommend students to companies after learning, which can greatly simplify the job search process.

中沙策展人携手举办沙特首届当代艺术双年展-新华网新华社利雅得12月12日电（记者王海洲 胡冠）沙特阿拉伯首届当代艺术双年展 — — 迪里耶当代艺术双年展，于11日在位于沙特首都利雅得西北部的迪里耶JAX艺术区正式向公众开放，共有来自沙特、中国等地的64位艺术家参展。

 [/INST] The first contemporary art biennial exhibition of Qatar, titled "Doha Contemporary Art Biennial 2021," was officially opened to the public on November 11 in the Doha JAX Art Zone, which is located in the northwest of Doha, the capital of Qatar. A total of 64 artists from Qatar, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.

本次双年展由沙特迪里耶双年展基金会和中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心联合策划，中国UCCA尤伦斯当代艺术中心馆长田霏宇担任艺术总监。据策展团队介绍，本次双年展的主题为“摸着石头过河 ” ， 隐喻社会经济转型时期所采取的改革策略，也反映沙特社会文化发展的当下境遇。

 [/INST] The current bi-annual exhibition is organized by the Saudi Binladin Group and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, with Tian Xiaoyu, the director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serving as the art director. According to the organizing team, the theme of this bi-annual exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as the current state of cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

本次双年展占地近12000平方米，展厅横跨六个相互连接的建筑，以六个单元呈现 ： 《 摸着石头过河 》 《 传承作为实验 》 《 边缘思考 》 《 走向公众 》 《 美丽新世界》以及《论艺术的精神 》 。其中，27位沙特艺术家的作品数量占本次展品总量的四成以上，囊括绘画、装置艺术和表演艺术等多种形式；12位中国艺术家的作品同样备受关注，有的艺术家以新颖的方式使用回收材料进行创作，例如徐冰在《背后的故事系列之溪山无尽图 》 （ 2014）中，用废弃物重构了一幅经典山水画。

 [/INST] The current bi-annual exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, with six connected buildings showcasing six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Moving Toward the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art." Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists make up more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in "The Backstory Series: Endless Mountains" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials.

 [/INST] The chairman of the Beijing Biennale Foundation, Barclay, expressed his hope that this biennale would establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia's booming development, and enhance mutual exchanges. Tian Yu said: "The goal of the biennale is double-sided, both allowing contemporary art from Saudi Arabia to participate in global dialogue, and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world."

云南：统筹规范乡村公益性岗位管理-新华网新华社昆明12月12日电（记者林碧锋）为持续做好脱贫人口就业帮扶，巩固拓展脱贫攻坚成果，云南省日前出台促进乡村振兴乡村公益性岗位管理相关政策，助力全面推进乡村振兴。

 [/INST] Yunnan: Standardizing the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Villages - Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th, 2021 (Reporter Lin Bijian) To continuously improve employment opportunities for poor people and consolidate and expand the achievements of attacking poverty, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in villages, which will help to comprehensively promote village revitalization.

云南省人社厅有关负责人介绍，目前，云南共开发44.83万个乡村公益性岗位，用于安置脱贫劳动力等农村困难群体就业，在帮助脱贫群众实现就业增收、巩固脱贫攻坚成果、有效提升乡村各项公共服务能力等方面发挥重要作用。此次新规由云南人社、乡村振兴、财政等七部门联合印发，主要对基层招聘乡村公益性岗位人员的对象范围、资金管理、岗位开发、岗位管理等方面进行统一规范。

 [/INST] The Yunnan Provincial People's Bureau has released an introduction to the responsible persons for the development of public welfare positions in villages. Currently, Yunnan has developed 44,830 public welfare positions for the employment of disadvantaged rural labor force and other difficult groups in villages. These positions play an important role in helping disadvantaged groups find employment, increasing their income, consolidating their anti-poverty achievements, and effectively improving the public service capabilities of villages in various aspects. This new rule has been jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial People's Bureau, the Rural Revitalization Bureau, and the Finance Bureau, among others, and mainly aims to standardize the recruitment of village public welfare position personnel, financial management, position development, and position management.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

在岗位开发设置方面，新规明确，按照“按需设岗、以岗定人、动态管理、总量控制 ” “ 谁开发、谁使用、谁负责”及“一人一岗、自愿公开、统一管理”的原则进行设置。招聘程序必须按照公告、申报、审核、公示、聘用、岗前培训及安排上岗等步骤进行。

 [/INST] In terms of development position settings, the new rules are clear, following the principles of "on-demand posting, based on job definition, dynamic management, and total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person per post, self-voluntary disclosure, and unified management." The recruitment program must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-training before posting, and arrangement of posting.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

此外，新规还明确了乡村公益性岗位主要开发部门的具体职责、乡村公益性岗位的补贴标准和补贴方式，规定各乡村公益性岗位开发部门应为乡村公益性岗位安置人员购买意外伤害商业保险；要求有关部门定期对乡村公益性岗位补贴发放情况进行监督。

 [/INST] In addition, the new rules have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments in charge of developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and required each department in charge of developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It is also required that related departments regularly monitor the situation of subsidy payments for rural public welfare positions.

二、虽然右派在历史上有得志时代，但不长，所以短是因为给点儿阳光就灿烂，喝点儿开水就出汗；稍得志便得陇望蜀，遭打击便毛将焉附。但实事求是来说，右派在社会进步过程中起到过积极作用。

 [/INST] Although the right wing has had its moments in history, it is short-lived because it is dazzled by a little sunshine and sweats a little water. As soon as it gets its bearings, it is prone to being attacked and its spirit is dampened. However, in reality, the right wing plays a positive role in the process of social progress.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

从结束文革定义真理标准，发展经济提高科技以及促进行政制度化和人权保障等方面，右派的积极意义不该否定。三、就我而言，尽管不完全同意李伟东的有些说法，但我很在意他的说法，也很尊重李伟东这个人；因为他是认真的，他对中国是认真的，对中国的社会问题也是认真看待的。

 [/INST] From defining the truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting political systemization and protecting human rights, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied. Three, in my opinion, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements, and I highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincerely concerned about the social issues of China.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

但我反对他的反共理论，我认为反必要革命，革命则必然导致社会动荡，民生受损，政治团体鱼龙混杂泥沙俱下，再就是外国趁虚而入。四、改变或改善中国要有耐心和为国为民负责的态度，政治投机企图火中取栗者，那不是右派，是混蛋。

 [/INST] However, I oppose his anti-communist theory, I believe that revolution is necessary, revolution is inevitably accompanied by social turbulence, people's lives are harmed, political organizations are chaotic and mixed with mud and sand, and finally, foreign countries take advantage of the chaos to enter. Four, changing or improving China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people, political speculation attempts to take advantage of the chaos, that is not the right-wing, but the mixed egg.

 [/INST] If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts at the right time, and the left will not have been corrupted, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away. Five, I recently saw some friends criticizing counter-revolutionaries and rejecting left-wing madness, and they were also full of vigor. I think it's not necessary.

我这样告诉朋友们：当反贼骂你五毛，当左癫骂你右狗的时候，恰恰证明我们的这条中间道路是正确的！许多人少年时候也有理想，老了之后，却忘了理想，或追求理想，却沦为偏执。

 [/INST] I would tell my friends: when a counterrevolutionary curses you as a five-mao, when a leftist curses you as a right dog, that proves our middle path is correct! Many people had ideals in their youth, but forgot them as they grew older, or pursued them but became dogmatic.
[INST] Translate the following text from Chinese to English.

和理想渐行渐远，甚至屠龙少年终成恶龙。左右我觉得一般是指约束和自由，中国从历史文化的先天基因导致中国整体应该是偏左。

 [/INST] The gap between reality and idealism gradually widens, and even the young dragon eventually becomes an evil dragon. I think left and right generally indicate constraints and freedom, and China, due to its historical and cultural roots, should be generally left-leaning.

而国内右派自由，注重效率和发展，左派加强监管，更注重公平以及安全。现在社会总体希望更注重公平，同时中美相争，偏左是肯定的，估计还得持续很多年。

Currently, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, but at the same time, there is tension between China and the United States, and the left-wing is definitely the case. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.

 [/INST] The coverage of the green comprehensive service area on the water surface is another milestone event in the construction of the Longjiang Green Navigation. The reception of pollutants from Longjiang ships has been significantly improved, and the navigation service capability has been enhanced. According to the introduction, the green comprehensive service area is an important facility that provides comprehensive production and living services for large ships and crew members, helping to solve the "urgent difficulty and anxiety" problem for crew members.

 [/INST] This time, two green comprehensive service areas have been built and run on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. They integrate life services, production services, and government services into one body, with environmental protection as the main theme, and ship repair and emergency rescue services as special features.
