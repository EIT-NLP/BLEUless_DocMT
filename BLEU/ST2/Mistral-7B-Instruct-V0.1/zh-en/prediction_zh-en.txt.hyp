Is there a way to punish him to prevent such events from happening again?

I think this rescue certificate is very meaningful - it's one of the important skill certificates besides my driving license!
Popularize below: Emergency measures are actually measures taken during the occurrence of sudden events, that is, rescue before the ambulance arrives. It is well known that the process of the ambulance arriving after an accident takes some time, and it is precisely this time that is the most critical.
This is the time when we need urgent help. If I really have a heart attack, brain hemorrhage, or respiratory arrest, then our window of life is only four minutes, golden four minutes!
Therefore, it is very important to know how to perform first aid. When someone collapses next to us, we can use our specialized knowledge to perform first aid, instead of standing there helplessly like a fool, which makes us feel very scared.
"In China, we have an official data of 300,000 unexpected deaths every year, the most dangerous one is heart attack. In the United States, on average, 15% can be rescued."
In Las Vegas's gambling hotel, 78% can be saved, while Shanghai and Beijing are below 1%. This is the first reaction from founder Luo Lei.
If a person experiences cardiac arrest, there is no breathing and no heartbeat. No matter how tightly you squeeze the person's chest, it will have no effect. The only way to save the person is through artificial ventilation and external chest compression.
I discovered that not many people have the awareness to learn first aid, but when the situation happens, it's too late. Therefore, I urge everyone to learn this skill, so that we can respond quickly in emergency situations. Who knows, it may even save someone's life!
You can sign up for an emergency response certificate at your local Red Cross training center. I signed up at the Red Cross training center in Shenzhen. Students also have a discount. PS: The last picture is a record of my goal to complete before I turned 25. Adding the emergency response certificate to my goal list was something I did a few months ago, but I actually completed it!
After finishing the other exams I wanted to take, I planned to take a scuba diving certificate. I saw a scuba diving rescue certificate on little red book before, so I thought I would need a rescue certificate to take the scuba diving exam, therefore a rescue certificate is still very useful!

Yesterday, it was reported on the Xinhua News Agency that the Chongqing Municipal Vocational and Technical School will pilot the "modern apprenticeship system" for talent cultivation starting this year. Students who participate in the trial will simultaneously possess apprentice status, and after recruitment and enrollment, they will be pre-registered as employees of trial-point enterprises.
The Municipal Education Committee requires the standardization of the recruitment and employment process for vocational schools and enterprises, clearly defining the dual identity of vocational school students and enterprise employees, and implementing the principle of mutual selection. Students, schools, and enterprises should sign a three-party agreement, and for students who are not yet 18 years old, a four-party agreement should be signed by the student, guardian, school, and enterprise, to determine each party's rights and the specific post that the student will be trained for, the teaching content, and the rights protection. It is encouraged to try out schools that use modern student forms and cooperate with enterprises to conduct enterprise employee pre-training and transfer training.
The school wants to reform the talent cultivation model. The school and enterprise jointly design the talent cultivation plan, jointly establish professional teaching standards, course standards, job standards, enterprise master standards, quality control standards, and corresponding implementation plans.
The trial period should be used to cultivate the academic system. The duration of internship in enterprises should be determined according to the talent cultivation plan of the major. The top-level internship usually lasts for 6 months. In enterprise practice, the enterprise group management mode should be implemented, and according to the characteristics of different majors, one master can supervise 2 to 5 apprentices, forming a learning small group, to ensure that students are proficient in the skills required for each rotation post.
According to the arrangement, from 2016 to August 2019, my city determined 60 city-level vocational and technical school test points, with each test point having around 50 people, and a total of around 3,000 students (students) were trained. Following the principle of trying out points first and then pushing forward, step by step, explore the establishment of school-enterprise joint recruitment, joint training, and one-body nurturing of long-effective mechanisms, and improve the students' job position skills, increase the students' job placement rate and quality.

South African Doctor: Omicron Spreads Strong but Mostly Mild South African doctors and medical experts believe that the illness caused by the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus is milder than the Delta variant, although it spreads faster.
According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency, as the Omicron variant spreads in South Africa, a group of over 5,000 doctors in the Western Cape province of South Africa reported that the symptoms of the patients they are currently treating with COVID-19 are generally milder, such as body aches and coughs similar to the flu. The head of the organization, Dr. Unben Pillay, said that he sees several dozen patients every day, but none of them require hospitalization.
Pele said: "They can control the disease at home, and most people recover within 10 to 14 days of isolation. He said that this includes elderly patients and those with health issues, who are more susceptible to severe illness due to COVID-19 infection."
He said, compared to the previous Delta wave of the COVID-19 outbreak, the patients he treated had difficulty breathing and low oxygen levels. Many people needed to be hospitalized within a few days.
Two weeks after the first report of the Omicron variant virus in South Africa, other doctors also shared similar experiences. Although it takes several weeks to collect enough data, doctors' observations and early evidence provide some clues.
According to the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases, among the recent hospitalized COVID-19 patients, only 30% have severe illness, which is half of the serious illness rate in the previous wave; the average hospital stay has been shortened from 8 days to 2.8 days; the death rate among recent COVID-19 patients is only 3%, while in the early outbreak of the disease in South Africa, the death rate was 20%. Dr. Willem Hanekom, the director of the African Health Research Institute, cited data from the South African National Institute for Communicable Diseases and other reports, saying, "So far, all evidence suggests that this is a relatively mild disease."
He also said: "Now is still the early stage, we need to obtain the data of the later period. Generally speaking, the time of hospitalization and death is relatively late, but we entered this epidemic only two weeks ago."
At the same time, scientists around the world are monitoring the number of cases and hospitalization rates, while testing the effectiveness of current vaccines and treatment methods. Although Delta remains the dominant COVID-19 virus strain globally, Omicron cases have been reported in more than 20 countries, with South Africa being the epicenter of the outbreak.
According to the health officials, the number of new cases in Shandong province increased by 400% in the first week of December, and the test showed that the Omicron variant accounted for more than 90% of the cases.

Yang Hongdong announced the spirit of the 19th plenary session of the CPC Central Military Commission and the provincial party committee at Ma'an Mountain, drawing on the fighting spirit from the 100-year history of the party's struggle.
The Hunan Daily reported on December 10th that, according to the provincial committee's unified arrangement, Yang Haodong, a member of the Hunan Provincial Committee and the head of the Hunan Provincial Propaganda Department, gave an interactive speech at the Marble Mountain Video Art and Creativity Yard on December 10th in the morning. He deeply studied the spirit of the 19th Plenary Session of the Central Military Commission, the spirit of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Central Military Commission, on important speeches and important instructions, and the spirit of the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress. Yang Haodong, from the perspective of ideological beliefs and initial aspirations, self-revolution and youthful party, party leadership and party theory, comprehensively and systematically explained the core meaning and practical requirements of the conference spirit through his own understanding and personal experience.
He pointed out that it is important to combine the spirit of the whole meeting and the spirit of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Military Commission, with the spirit of the Hunan Provincial Party Congress. This should be done by integrating and connecting the two, enhancing the awareness of self-consciousness, political self-consciousness, and action self-consciousness, and firmly following the guidance of Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the CPC Central Military Commission. In the interactive exchange section, representatives from the grassroots, enterprises, and young people discussed the relationship between the three historical decisions, such as how to understand the significance of the "two certainties" decision, how cultural enterprises should grasp the guiding direction, and how young people in the new era should draw strength from the hundred-year party history. Yang Hailong answered these questions using simple language and vivid examples, and he earnestly encouraged young party members to draw strength from the hundred-year struggle history of the party, to tightly gather around the center of the party, and to firmly follow the party. Use youth to write responsible and undertake tasks.

"In reality, I don't know if it's the store's mistake or the courier's mistake that there is no receipt in the bag."
"I couldn't find the information you were looking for, I hope you understand."
Thank you, because the delivery time was 30 minutes faster than shown.
Yes, he has already changed his horse and has been waiting for a long time.
The restaurant has been saying it's processing for several hours.
I have already taken photos and uploaded them to you.
I know. But the restaurant doesn't know why the delivery time is constantly delayed.
Originally, I wanted to be #NUMBER#, but in the end, I didn't call myself that.
If you don't eat what I give you, I'm sure you'll complain.
"You can't deliver it, why don't you talk earlier so I don't have to wait for so long?"
"No, I haven't received the call please notification. Inform him to resend it to our company."
I don't want to wait #NUMBER# minutes anymore.
"The meal took half an hour, but it hasn't been delivered yet."
Why can't I cancel the order?
Hello, the chicken from the restaurant is alive.
I want to try playing basketball, but I'm afraid I won't be able to persist, so I want to find a ball at a similar price to practice first. It's not friendly, in fact, the price is often inversely proportional to friendliness. If you can't distinguish, the expensive ones are usually more friendly than the cheap ones. These "entry-level balls" are actually industrial waste.
They are not very strong, the ball hits the net, the vibration is very large, the hard ball cannot withstand it, and all skilled players have difficulty controlling it. The logic and implicit meaning behind this is that tennis is very difficult, they know you won't be able to learn it, and they also know you won't be willing to buy expensive ones, so they sell you cheap ones to deceive you, you play two games and then you won't be able to play again, this way the net is cheap and you won't worry about it.
Are you really able to distinguish between good and bad, which means you have made progress, and then come back to my place to buy expensive ones, and I will make two profits? I suggest you buy a second-hand ball racket for a similar price, choose Prince or Djokovic, these two brands are not very famous, so the ball racket will not sell at a high price, a new one for 500-600 yuan is good, and a second-hand one for 200 yuan, isn't it enjoyable to own a ball racket worth a thousand yuan?
The newcomers are very friendly, but once they get past the newcomer stage, they become complacent, but most people, especially women, can't get past the newcomer stage.
Could you please help track the delivery of my order, which has been delayed multiple times?
Delayed thanks
"Are you asking if I already have credit?"
Do I need to place a new order? Did you ignore the previous order?
Hello, I ordered food from this restaurant, but the food that was delivered was missing many items, and the Kung Pao Chicken was still alive.
#PRS_ORG# Please cancel the order that I placed, as I do not want to pick it up. There is no self-pickup involved in this matter.
The Jiangxi Provincial Education Department has recently announced that it will train 10,000 village small school teachers in music, art, and physical education over the next three years, starting from 2016, in order to enhance the ability of the teaching team, ensure the balanced development of rural compulsory education, and improve the quality of education in rural areas.
According to the understanding, the target objects for this training are village teachers in Jiangxi province who have a foundation in music, art, and physical education or abilities, and can teach other subjects related to music, art, and physical education. Through training, they will master the basic knowledge and teaching skills of music and art education, update their teaching ideas and beliefs, master modern teaching methods, improve their subject teaching ability, activity design ability, campus culture ability, and self-development ability. They will build a team of specialized and multi-talented music and art teachers, alleviate the shortage of village music and art teachers, and promote the development of village education.
To ensure the quality and effectiveness of training, Jiangxi also plans to train 100 teachers in each county (city, district) of the province for small schools in music, art, and physical education, a total of 300 teachers. This will comprehensively improve their teaching demonstration leadership ability, teaching research activity organization ability, teaching ability, network research and modification workshop building ability, and play the role of teaching, demonstrating, guiding, and supervising.
Because it has been waiting for 20 minutes, it has already waited for 1 hour #NUMBER# minutes.
I don't want food that was prepared 1 hour ago.
I found the buyer of the previous erroneous order, but my car tire is missing.
Hello, how long will it take for the food you ordered to be delivered?
The phone number of the person you called is #PHONENUMBER# and their name is #NAME#.
"It's inconvenient for you to give a reasonable explanation, but your handwriting is problematic, please handle it carefully."
Can you check if the person is still on the road? If they are, please deliver the order. If not, please return the payment for the order.
In reality, there are many particularities when it comes to matching outfits for overweight girls with short bodies. The length of the skirt for an overweight girl should not be too short or too long, with the ideal length being around the knee, just long enough to cover the area of the thighs.
If the skirt is too short, it will reveal the fat on the legs. If it is too long, it will give people a feeling of being short and fat.
If you wear your clothes divided into the top, middle, and bottom three sections, it will make you look taller, with different colors for your upper body, skirt, and long leggings. In fact, many dark-colored clothes are popular among overweight girls (the author has a deep understanding of this). Dark colors are also a good way to hide your body fat, and high-end, elegant black short skirts are a favorite among overweight girls.
Wearing dark-colored clothes, especially black short pants, can make people feel a bit thinner. If your legs are quite fat, make sure your socks and shoes are not too noticeable.
The more popular, the better. Don't let the colors be too bright. People might pay attention to your legs and feet, making them feel fat.
For a slightly plump little girl, it is important to know the keys to dressing well. A plump girl should never wear tight-fitting short skirts, and the top should not be too short or too tight, which will make people feel uncomfortable. If the legs are thick, it is better to wear black long leggings or net leggings (the kind with small holes), and choose soft and comfortable printed pants to match, which can effectively cover up the shortcomings of a plump girl.
Certainly, a chubby girl wearing short skirts should choose an upper garment that matches the color of the skirt. This will make your chubby figure appear taller when wearing short skirts.
Pairing short skirts with high heels can make your legs look longer, which is the most fashionable combination for summer! If you have a chubby upper body but thin legs, I recommend choosing a fancy dress with a short skirt.
Not only can it cover the big stomach, but it can also showcase your advantages. A short A-line skirt will be very slimming, especially suitable for overweight girls, and the top should be fitted a bit tighter to create a layering effect and make it even more slimming.
A simple and plain white T-shirt paired with short pants is also suitable for overweight men. Even micro-obese girls can pull off a fashionable look.
As long as you master the rules of dressing coordination, even overweight girls will become the focus of attention. With changes in dressing coordination, it's important to exercise more in life and strive to be free from the label of overweight women.

I bought a notebook and I think it's pretty good. It's mainly used for design, and the price-quality ratio is very high. It's lighter than I imagined, and it's also more beautiful than I imagined. The red on the back cover is a very good-looking shade of red wine, not too flashy. Overall, it exceeds my expectations by a lot, and it's a good value for money. It's also suitable for girls. Two years ago, I started getting into the MacBook Dark Knight, and after using it for two years, the price-quality ratio is very high, and the quality is very durable!
My friends around me also recommend buying this product! We have already purchased the series of 3 machines!
The exterior is beautiful and the configuration is also very good for outsiders to buy, I originally wanted to wait for the 418 bank activity, but he was in a hurry, so I bought it in advance, so I couldn't catch up with the bank's big activity, and I felt a little regret.
Although the price-to-performance ratio is high and the logistics are fast, it's been a while since I last reviewed a new, original-packaged laptop with a super high price-to-performance ratio. The design style is quite good, and it has already been installed with Windows 11 and Office 2019.
Display Effect: Bought a 3D rendering software for a child, installed it, and the child said it was okay. This computer's performance for 3D design work is good. Gave it to my son, and he said it was great.
The computer is very good, especially the customer service attitude is very good. If you don't understand the question, it's okay. The recommendation to buy is not bad, and the game graphics are really fragrant.
Is there only one dumpling order? Why does the hand have 6 fingers?
I won't go if it's based on an order.
"I haven't been contacted by anyone for an hour, is this what you thought was my first time ordering takeout online?"
After the investigation is complete, you will also say it like this! I checked the address several times before placing the order, and it was only after checking it a few times that I placed the order successfully. Thank you! How many days is it?
The order has not been delivered from 7:00 am to 9:30 am. It is necessary to return the deposit and cancel the order.
The title of the new Xiānshān district long-distance running event is the loudest! This time, our team brings you this car, which is the dream of many men!
It is the flagship supercar of Lamborghini, the successor to the Murcielago, the Aventador LP700-4! It costs around 200,000 euros, and the annual road tax is around 15,000 euros. It has four-wheel drive, so why is it called LP700?
Because your car has 700 horsepower, can you imagine how fast it is? Even the editor doesn't know, the data says that it takes only 2.9 seconds to accelerate from 0-100 km/h, which means your myvi probably takes 30 km/h to reach 100 km/h, huh.
The low-slung body, the flamboyant scissor doors, the large air intakes covering the entire body of the car, and the 6.5 v12 engine visible under the glass, perfectly embody the style of Lamborghini. There's no need for a detailed explanation of the car model, just a quick Google search will do. The editor has compiled some explanations that may not be available on Google.
The text in Chinese is:  太过备受瞩目，去到哪里大家都在看，很不自在！(其实有点爽)1km油钱在RM1左右 (车主根本不care)  Translation to English:  Too many people are looking at it, go to where everyone is looking, it's not comfortable! (Actually it's a bit cool) 1km oil money is around RM1 (The car owner doesn't care)
The posture of getting in and out of a car should be practiced a bit, otherwise it will be a bit awkward (because it will crawl out of the car and get stuck halfway). The engine sound is too loud, and it will be deafening after getting off the car. (But it's still pretty cool.)
The car is too big, it will be very narrow to park it in a normal parking spot. I'm afraid that when the car next to me opens its door, it will hit me. It's a bit lonely because there's no one on the road. (Note: This text is from the author's personal experience and is not related to the car owner.)
"Everyone, please don't misunderstand, this video is not for sale, I'm sorry! If you want to take a video of your car for a friend, please contact us!"

The Bugatti Chiron and Porsche 911 are both well-known cars among car enthusiasts. Chiron is considered one of the most expensive hypercars globally, while the Porsche 911's price is also in the millions. Recently, a Chinese driver managed to crash both a million-dollar 911 and a million-dollar Chiron in a matter of minutes.
Look at the result, it makes sense!

According to a recent report from the Education Department of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi universities will implement a flexible education system, extending the maximum allowable rest study period for university students from 2 to 5 years, based on the existing educational system. The rest study period for university students to engage in entrepreneurship will be considered as practical education time.
To promote the entrepreneurship and innovation abilities of college students, the education and social departments in Guangxi jointly built an entrepreneurship platform. They established more college student extracurricular practice teaching bases, college science and technology parks, college student entrepreneurship parks, and entrepreneurship incubation bases to provide external protection for college students' entrepreneurship. According to the requirements, by 2020, the area of innovation and entrepreneurship practice bases in each high school should be at least 30,000 square meters, and high vocational and technical schools should be at least 20,000 square meters.
The government encourages universities to set up innovation and entrepreneurship courses, giving priority support to students who excel in practical innovation and entrepreneurship. University teachers must spend at least two months working in industry enterprises every two years to improve their awareness and ability to teach innovation and entrepreneurship education.
The autonomous region education department requires all high schools in Guangxi to deeply implement the college student innovation and entrepreneurship training plan, in order to ensure that every college student participates in at least one innovation and entrepreneurship training plan during their school period. High schools should actively organize students to participate in various levels and types of innovation and entrepreneurship competitions, and provide financial support.

The Full-View Wedding Photography Base (Hebei Store) has not yet established a branch for bridal fashion and makeup, but the makeup artist is highly skilled, and the photography technique and angle are highly specialized, resulting in excellent photographic effects.
The seller has a very good reputation, and the service attitude is also very good. The makeup is very neat, and the team service is also very good. This trip was very happy, and the team was very professional. The seller's service attitude was also very good, and he would introduce it to his friends. I am very satisfied.
Thank you to the photographer and makeup artist for giving me unique wedding photos. Thank you to all the staff who worked today to take my wedding photos. I look forward to seeing the final product.
Taking wedding photos is a physically demanding task, especially for the photographer who has to run and jump around. The makeup artist was very caring and helped me design a flattering makeup look that suited my face shape. The photographer had a humorous and playful attitude during the shoot, which was highly appreciated.
Thank you to my photographer and makeup artist, who have made me look so beautiful even at this age. To the bride, your eyes are bright, your face is big and elegant, and you look like a virtuous wife and a good mother. In the future, you will take care of your family with diligence and frugality.
The groom has finally earned his living, and he will be happy for the rest of his life with his beautiful and lovely bride. The wedding photos are of high quality, just as they are said to be online, and my husband and I look very handsome and beautiful in them. We are very satisfied.
The seller's attitude was very enthusiastic. This time, not only did we enjoy the scenery, but we also took beautiful wedding photos, and recognized our friend who is a photographer.
The wedding photos are so beautiful, the photographer and makeup artist are really professional. Thank you so much for Mimi's patience and careful guidance, the photos I like very much~
When I saw my wedding photos, I couldn't recognize myself for a moment. As long as the photographer is good, you can also have wedding photos that are as beautiful as stars.
Taking wedding photos is very important, it's great that I met a photographer and makeup artist who both approved online. After seeing my wedding photos, I realized that I was also "photoshopped".
Chinese: 美亚裔团体投诉耶鲁等3所常春藤名校招生歧视-新华网新华社会盛顿5月23日电（记者徐剑梅）美国130多个亚裔团体23日向美国教育部和司法部提交申诉，抗议3所常春藤名校 — — 耶鲁大学、布朗大学和达特茅斯学院在招生过程中歧视亚裔申请学生。  English: Over 130 Chinese-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on May 23, opposing discrimination against Chinese-American applicants by three well-known Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the recruitment process.
The Asian Education League, which initiated an appeal, held a press conference in Washington, D.C. today. The chairman of the organization, Zhou Yukun, said in the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American universities has grown exponentially in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three American universities has been basically maintained at the same level.
Many studies have shown that these universities in the so-called "comprehensive consideration" recruitment process have long-term and systematically discriminated against Asian applicant students. Zhao Yusheng introduced that according to the research of Sedgwick et al. in 2014, in these three universities, the number of applicants relative to the number of applicants, the acceptance rate of Asians is the lowest among all ethnic groups.
According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Duke University have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota for Asian applicants of over 20 years. Zhou Yusheng told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope to submit an appeal and expect the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to conduct an investigation and take measures to stop these universities from discriminating against Asian students after the facts are confirmed.
They also hope that the university will actively pay attention to this issue and change its recruitment policy for Asians. So far, none of the three schools have responded to the complaint.
The Asian Education Coalition was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions. However, the US Department of Education rejected the complaint on the grounds of programmatic reasons. This time, in addition to US-based Asian organizations, Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani and other Asian education organizations also participated in the appeal.
The order was canceled just now because the cutlery was needed.
Why can I still check if there has been a cancellation while in the execution process?

In September 2020, Mr. Li learned about a factory located in Xiangjiang Baluyao Xiangquan Town. After multiple on-site inspections, Mr. Li decided to purchase the factory. In December 2020, Mr. Li negotiated the details of the factory purchase with the owner of the house and their family, and on the same day, through bank transfer, he paid a down payment of 20,000 yuan.
Lin Some signed the "Factory Purchase and Sale Deposit Receipt" as the payee, clearly stating, "If the buyer does not want to buy this factory, the deposit will be returned to the seller. If the seller does not want to sell this factory, the deposit will be doubled and returned to the seller. Both parties agree to sign the factory purchase and sale contract within one week." However, after that, the two parties could not reach a consensus on the main contract terms such as the sale range and payment method, causing the factory purchase and sale contract to be delayed in signing.
Considering that both parties were unable to reach a consensus on the contents of the contract, Lin Some returned the 20,000 yuan deposit to Luo First several days later. After seeing the house and paying the deposit, the rent was also prepared, but it was just missing "signing at the door" to sign the contract. However, the seller did not sell it, which made Luo First helpless and angry.
This is why Mr. Li sued Mr. Lin at the Yueyang People's Court. The court, after reviewing the case, found that the two parties were unable to sign a formal contract, and it was not fair to hold only the defendant responsible. Instead, it should be reasonably assumed that the negotiations failed, and this case should not be applied to the penalty for breach of contract. The defendant should not be held responsible for returning double the penalty for breach of contract.
After the first trial, the defendant filed an appeal. Recently, the second court upheld the original verdict.
[Lawyer Reminder] During the trading process, it is necessary to exercise due caution. As the buyer, it is necessary to exercise due caution when signing the contract, such as verifying the information of the owner of the house, whether the house is occupied by people, and other relevant information. It is also necessary to clearly specify the specific delivery time and place in the contract to prevent disputes from arising when the contract is executed.
"Okay, I'm afraid he might have sent the wrong address."
The restaurant "Ri Chang Can Guan" (Five-Door-Kuai Dian) has a fragrant environment. The service is efficient. My must-try dish is "Gǔ Fǎ Mǎ Lǎo" (Ancient Marmalade). The marmalade is too fragrant, too soft, and too delicious. Friends who like sweet things should definitely try "Dō Jiāng Mǐ Yú Slī Hóu Dòu Fàn Chǎo". The soup is very fresh and delicious. The tofu is very soft. The mussels are...
The aroma is great, meat is good, and the service is warm. It's been a long time since I last came, and now it's a day of prosperity. Fruits are still as delicious to drink, and the materials are real. It's my first time trying skewered pork belly, and it's the soft, southern-style noodles that I love!
The fried rice is perfectly dry and moist, the portion is very large, the signboard is as usual, the soup is also not bad, the green onion processing is also quite good... the taste is great, the service is warm, and the meat is good.
The Day Chang Store was once a popular spot among netizens many years ago, located on Dongsanxiaoluo, wood flooring. The line outside the door was always very long and it took a long time to get a bowl of fried rice. The frying pans used for fried rice have all cracked...
It's been several years since I last went to Yuecheng. The rise of various small shops selling Cantonese cuisine has dispersed the crowds. It's rare to find a seat when you arrive, and the quality of the food is unmatched, just as expected.
"The taste is great, meat is good, the main dish is praised at Day Chang outside delivery."
The meal: This time's dish was slightly disappointing. Three bowls of chicken: The accompanying vegetables were a little too much, and the chicken meat was a little too little.
The main flavor of this dish has a slight deviation, the bottom taste is not salty enough, so the sweet flavor is more prominent, everyone can imagine sweet + various spices mixed with vegetables...
What is the red label whisky drinking law? Everyone has different tastes, some people like collecting, some people like food, of course there are also people who like drinking whisky. Red label whisky is currently one of the most popular Scottish whiskies in each country and has won the gold award in the International Whisky Competition.
Each bottle of red label whisky has its own unique taste, but if you don't know how to savor it, you might ruin its aroma. So how do you drink red label whisky?
Hello everyone, I'll give you a simple introduction to the red card whisky drinking rules.

This liquor can be directly consumed with ice or mixed with your favorite drinks. Due to its unpopularity in China, Red Label Whisky has been mixed with Coca-Cola or Sprite or other carbonated drinks to become a popular trend.
These sweet drinks not only can neutralize sour taste, but also can give people visual enjoyment when added to drinks, which has the effect of diluting the taste of alcohol and changing the mouthfeel. The most authentic and traditional way to drink is to add red wine, lemon slices, and sugar (sugar can also be used).
The authentic taste of red wine has a slightly sour and sweet flavor. Adding sugar can balance the sour taste, and lemon will give the wine a fresh and clean aroma. Of course, the sweet and sour degree can be adjusted according to personal taste preference. These three are the best ways to drink red wine, which can be used as a reference for everyone to try. I hope my introduction can help you.
If it is not possible to change the store location for me, can it be delivered outside?

The wife's wedding photography (south street store) is not yet open for business because we have not yet arranged our time. We changed the time twice, and the consultant Lan Lan was very patient in helping us arrange the time.
Afterwards, he chose a weekend with good weather to take pictures. The employees of Mrs. Gold's, whether they were consultants, makeup artists, or photographers, were all very good.
That was the first time in my life that I formally put on makeup, wow! I can't believe it, I'll be that beautiful one day too, haha. Cleansing and another sister (I'm sorry, I don't remember her name) put on makeup very patiently, and it was very natural.
The scenery in the photograph was taken in the city of Jiangwan, fortunately the weather that day was good, not too cold, so we didn't feel uncomfortable during the photo shoot. The makeup artist paid attention to our clothes and accessories from time to time, if there was anything wrong, they immediately helped us straighten up. The photographer was also very funny, after taking photos for a whole day, we all felt very happy.
When taking photos, because I saw many cases online, I didn't want to make the customer delete too many photos, but when we were taking photos, there was no intention of adding more photos at all. We directly took 24 photos, none of which were added. (I heard that my friend who took wedding photos around the same time took around 7,000 photos and added around 100,000 photos. At that time, I was stunned and scared that I would choose too many.) Today the photos were fixed, and Lan Lan gave them to me. I looked at them and found that there were two that weren't good, and they immediately helped me redo them.
Translate the following text from Chinese to English.  Comparing the photographs taken by my sister before, I think our photos are truly satisfactory. They are simple, clear and clean, which is exactly the style I want. I sincerely recommend everyone to go to Xuan Han Jin Fu Ren to take wedding photos!
The set price is 3999 yuan. The wife sincerely thanks you for your true wish for your happiness and wishes you a prosperous future.

Your name is Zheng Mèn, this is your second week in Japan. You were walking on the street when suddenly you felt someone following you, you got scared and ran faster and faster until you ran away.
The person behind you called out: "小姐！请等等！" (full Japanese dialogue) You stopped at the convenience store door. "小姐......I am a director, I think you are very beautiful, are you interested in participating in a reality show?"
You are skeptical and afraid that this is a scam. He gave you a business card, and you found out that he is indeed the director of a large Japanese entertainment company.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on November 11th, the Sandba National Population Registration Office stated that due to the special anti-counterfeit paper being out of stock, it has been unable to issue birth certificates to newborn babies since October. As of now, the total number of affected individuals has reached 3,200.
However, the director of the birth certificate office, Karula Aminusi, assured that all babies whose birth certificates have been applied for have had their information recorded in the system. As soon as the counterfeit paper arrives next week, it will be supplemented. He explained this at a news conference in response to a 10-month report by a network media on the issue of sandba reporting birth certificates being printed.
He said that the problem had appeared two months ago, and Xinjiang also faced the same problem. "One of the reasons is that the Chinese factory producing special anti-counterfeit paper was affected by the epidemic, causing a delay in delivery to our country."
He explained that the anti-counterfeit paper used in Shenzhen for printing newspapers is different from that in other regions, so it cannot be borrowed from other provinces' goods. Kailu Amicus revealed that the latest batch of anti-counterfeit paper had arrived in Guangzhou on June 6th and was delivered to the printing company on the 8th to carry out some printing work.
"The local office will send someone to Kuala Lumpur to pick up the documents on Thursday, and then immediately proceed with the final stage of printing in Sandakan. It is estimated that it will take about 2 more work days (December 20th) to deliver the documents to the applicant's hands."  "We will notify the applicant to pick up the birth certificates at the local office."
He has supplemented, Saba has issued 22,480,001 birth certificates this year.

Ji Ping stated that there is a special "Olympic tie" between the two countries in the center wave. The 1984 Winter Olympics successfully took place here, and two months later, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will be held, showcasing a simple, safe, and spectacular event to the world.
We are looking forward to deepening the exchange and cooperation between the two countries in various aspects of winter sports events and athlete training during the winter season. The Chinese embassy in Beijing is willing to continue playing a bridge role, using the Beijing Winter Olympics as a catalyst to further deepen the cultural exchange between the two countries, so that the two nations' people "together look to the future." We wish the Black Sea athletes to achieve excellent results in Beijing. Before the meeting, the Black Sea Olympic Committee held the "Tenth Annual Best Athlete Awards" ceremony, and Zhang Ping was invited as a special guest to award the best young athlete of Black Sea.
The Beijing Winter Olympics promotional video is being repeatedly played at the event venue.

48-hour negative nucleic acid test results, set "buffer zone" as the State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism requires strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic in port cities - Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, December 11, 2021 (Reporter Ni Ruifeng, Chu Tiansu) The State Council's joint prevention and control mechanism issued a notice on strengthening the prevention and control of the new coronavirus epidemic in port cities recently. It is required that people who leave the land border ports in port cities (excluding those connected to Hong Kong and Macau) hold negative nucleic acid test results within 48 hours before arriving at the land border ports. After arriving at the land border ports, they must undergo at least one nucleic acid test.
According to the notice, the time range for the above-mentioned requirements is from the date of determining the scope of the border cities within each province, municipality, and county, to March 15, 2022. Furthermore, the notice also states that, under certain conditions, border cities can be studied to set up a buffer zone for disease control within the jurisdiction.
The introduction of responsible persons from the National Health and Welfare Commission of the People's Republic of China stated that for some coastal cities, cross-border trade is the main economic pillar, and the flow of people between the two sides is frequent. Implementing differential management policies based on regions, the prevention and control line has become two lines, which is expected to move the border closer, compress the risk of disease outbreak, and achieve the maximum effect of disease prevention with the least social impact and the lowest social cost.
In recent years, many local cluster outbreaks of diseases have occurred in China, all of which were imported from abroad through border cities. The notice states that this exposes some issues with the timeliness of disease monitoring warnings, inadequate closure management of high-risk personnel, insufficient regular nucleic acid testing, inadequate disinfection of cold chain products at all stages, unstandardized management of isolation facilities, and inadequate scientific precision in disease emergency handling.
Notice Requirement:  1. Strengthen the disease control mechanism of the border city. 2. Improve the health monitoring warning system. 3. Implement border control measures. 4. Enhance disease control in the border city. 5. Scientifically and precisely carry out disease control work. 6. Strengthen the defense line against external inputs.  The notice emphasizes that each border city should synchronize the research and deployment of disease control with the protection of people's livelihoods. It is necessary to publish and widely disseminate the hotline for people's livelihood protection, to conduct regular inspections of the supply of basic living materials and prices, and to promptly solve and actively respond to the prominent issues raised by the public.
According to the notice, the ports mentioned include open land, water, and airports located in counties (cities, districts, flags), cities (lands, provinces, leagues), and directly administered cities. The specific scope is determined by each province (autonomous region, directly administered city) based on the requirements for epidemic prevention control and promptly announced.

"The Truth Behind 20 Years of Military Violence and Bloodthirsty Killing by the People's Liberation Army - Xinhua News (Video Source: Youku)"
On December 11th, a microblog post titled "Killing Machine" on the oil pipeline platform caused widespread attention. The post detailed the US's war in Afghanistan, which was carried out under the name of "counter-terrorism," and how through the war, American democracy was forcibly exported, resulting in 20 years of war, bloodthirsty violence, and indiscriminate killing of innocent people, and the commission of various crimes against humanity.
Excessively using drones to attack hospitals, schools and other civilian areas, distorting human nature, and establishing a killing group. For 20 years, the US military has killed thousands of innocent Afghans.
The Chinese military uses various forms of torture and humiliation against prisoners, which further arouses the hatred of more Afghans.
According to the video, the American "anti-terror" war "becomes more terrifying as it becomes more anti-terror." The war did not bring peace, democracy, prosperity hopes to the Afghan people, but only brought a country full of wounds and countless killings and destruction.
Click on the video, let's expose the truth of America's "anti-terrorism" as a bloodthirsty killing spree, and pierce through the hypocritical mask of American democracy!
The food delivery is late, and all the food has cooled down, becoming cold, dry, and hard, which cannot be eaten, and the soup has also spilled out.

"I have used #PRS_ORG# multiple times, and today's experience was the worst. It was completely unacceptable."
"Okay, it's possible but please remind the restaurant and the rider."
"Avoid it happening again"
I want to know the exact delivery time, but it keeps getting delayed.
"I am not sure if it is possible to refund the money if an order is cancelled at what time."
How can I pay the service fee to the delivery rider?
"A few hours ago, it was confirmed that a rider did not want to wait any longer."
Don't scare people on the starting line - When browsing bookstores, you can often feel the explosive popularity of success books.
The success books of today often emphasize the "best principles," which means first assuming or implying that you can "achieve it," and then telling you what you need to do to achieve it. This is equivalent to saying that you have already passed the most important and fundamental step of "how to achieve it."
Due to this, all these books have a common characteristic - either they encourage you to keep going until the end, or they simply don't care; either it's 100 or 0; either you climb Mount Tai, or you just sit there quietly. This "best principle" is recognized as "perfectly right" by everyone, but 99% of people will be scared off at the starting line.
Because this theory encourages the path of "you must endure pain, start anew, make a 180-degree turn," which is the fatal weakness of many people. For those who cling to routine, resist change, and refuse to innovate, you must loudly shout "you must change" in their ear, which is certainly self-deception and mockery of the bullfight.
Most people will be afraid to make a change before the "转变" characters, hesitant and unwilling to take the first step; or they will make a hasty decision to change based on a momentary impulse, and take the first step bravely, but the good scenery is often short-lived, and they cannot persist for long before giving up. The classic "从明天开始" section of Ma San's famous "从明天开始" skit is the most famous portrayal of this "universal human nature."
"The principle of 'best' has the biggest problem, which is that the threshold is too high, often exceeding the limit of ordinary people's ability, making most people 'watch the door with excitement'. Perhaps, the 'second-best principle' is a kind of possible way for more ordinary people to walk up the relatively successful path."
"The core principle of '次好原则' is to 'lower the threshold' - it encourages the idea of 'small victories leading to big victories', meaning that if you can't achieve 100, achieving 1 is still a victory: because 1 is always greater than 0; if you can't climb Mount Tai, climbing your family's front door step is still a victory: because it's still better than staying put. In short, as long as you do something, it's always better than doing nothing."
Due to the significant reduction of the threshold, there is now a greater possibility for ordinary people to persist, and the probability of success will increase as long as one persists. However, following the "second-best principle" success path may be slightly longer.
In summary, "the best principle" may have a flag that appears successful to everyone on the surface, but it can only truly motivate a few in reality. On the other hand, "the second-best principle" can effectively motivate more people and bring more benefits to more people.
Do I need to place a new order now?
The phone call kept ringing without anyone answering, causing delays.
"When will it arrive? It hasn't been sent yet."
How can I contact you? Please cancel the order.
I can't wait any longer, thank you.
He didn't send two orders, but there is an order that has already been completed. I want to ask how to contact the rider.
The first rider told me just now that there should be another rider to send.
According to the latest monitoring results, the amount of bare-headed goose resources hidden in the Qinghai Lake has increased by 0.71 tons this year, reaching 10.85 tons, which is 40 times more than the initial protection period in 2002.
The Chinese name for the bare-headed goose in the Qinghai Lake is "Tangyu." This is a rare and valuable fish species in Qinghai Lake, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of the "water-fish-bird" food chain in the Qinghai Lake ecosystem. In the 1960s and 1970s, due to human factors such as overfishing and breeding of bare-headed goose, the environment of the breeding water domain began to deteriorate, leading to a sharp reduction in the number of bare-headed goose. In 2002, the resource reserve of bare-headed goose in Qinghai Lake was only 2592 tons.
In 2004, the naked swan was listed as an endangered species in the "China Red List of Endangered Species". Since 2003, Qinghai Province has implemented a lake breeding program, prohibiting any organization, group or individual from catching naked swans in Qinghai Lake and its major rivers and tributaries, and prohibiting the sale of naked swans and their products.
At the same time, through artificial breeding and flow release, as well as cleaning the main inlet rivers of the Qinghai Lake, designing scientifically reasonable "passageways for fish" and other measures, the protection degree of Qinghai Lake has been continuously increased. Yang Lin, the deputy director of the Agriculture and Rural Affairs Bureau of Qinghai Province, introduced that as of now, more than 1.8 billion tails of Qinghai Lake sturgeon have been implemented through artificial breeding and flow release, and the contribution rate to the recovery of Qinghai Lake sturgeon resources exceeds 23%.
The Qinghai-Three-Rivers Source Area is an important ecological barrier and water source supply area not only in China but also in Asia. Qinghai Lake is a natural barrier and ecological function area that controls the westward expansion of aridization towards the east. To protect the ecological environment of the Three-Rivers Source Area and the water domain of Qinghai Lake, protect the wild animals and plants in the water, maintain the biodiversity of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, in recent years, Qinghai has successively issued fishing prohibition notices for the key water domains of the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and Qinghai Lake, and established a comprehensive fishing management system of "one river, one river, one lake".

The restaurant only gave me one bag, I have to put it in the bag, the weather is cold.
Can you tell me if takeout is put in a bag? We only see a bag.
"I want to know if it was leaked or if someone took it away, thanks."
It has been 1 hour already, and none of them have been sent yet.
Today is the Winter Solstice, so I need to order an extra meal for my friend to eat.
I hope that everyone in the bustling store takes a moment to check the products.
Is the tingling sensation in your feet when soaking them in a hot tub due to an electrical leak? Choosing the right hot tub can have great therapeutic benefits for your feet, and today's National Beauty Editor will provide an answer to this question, hoping to be of help to our friends.
With the increasing awareness of health among people, hot tubs have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different price ranges have appeared in the market, from hundreds to thousands of dollars. This has given consumers a lot of choice. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of hot tubs and other health-related household appliances have exploded, but there is no specific industry standard for hot tubs, so there are certain safety risks.
"Dipping your feet in an electric bath is too dangerous!" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot spa for his father as a birthday gift, but his father felt his feet going numb while soaking them.
Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but he didn't expect to turn off the vibration function and still feel his feet numb. Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that there was actually an electric current in the water of the foot bath.
Afterwards, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he had withdrawn the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable. Because he found that this popular bathtub, which has been used for a long time, does not have a clear and detailed industry standard for the highest temperature setting, the applicable person group, and the harmless materials.
However, in general, electric problems are unlikely to occur in foot bath tubs. However, it cannot be ruled out that some products may have issues when they are first manufactured. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a foot bath tub with separate parts.
The separation of water and electricity has no safety risks. At the same time, you can freely use an electric pen to test it.
The 13th Hunan Tea Expo and New Red Tea Introductory Fair opened today at the Hunan International Exhibition Center, showcasing the tea industry, innovative tea technology, promoting tea culture, and accelerating the achievement of the billion-dollar tea production industry target.
The Vice-Chairman of the China National Foreign Trade Cooperation General Corporation, Yao Shunli, and the Vice-Chairman of the Provincial People's Congress, Ye Hongzhong, attended the opening ceremony. Professor Liu Jianhua, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, introduced the new energy injected into the "Five-Color Xiang Tea" by the rise of red tea at the opening ceremony.

The wind and water flow in circles, and red tea is strong again. Experts in the tea industry in the province say that after picking green tea, red tea, and black tea, tea farmers have income all year round, and the value of tea plantations continues to increase.
At the opening ceremony, the provincial leader presented the fourth batch of companies authorized to use the "Hunan Red Tea" trademark. The new brand "Hunan Red Tea Source" was highly praised. In the new Hunan Red Tea Exhibition Hall, a Fujian tea merchant immediately placed an order for a tea named "Ice Inside Spring" after seeing it.
The Secretary-General of the Provincial Tea Industry Association, Wang Zhong, was excited to say that the current situation, including the epidemic, has had some impact on the tea market. However, from the tea fair scene, there were many bright spots. The new tea, which is infused with tea culture, has gained popularity, and trade is booming. The tea industry in Hunan welcomes the new spring with joy.

The following text in Chinese needs to be translated into English:  [正版书籍] [小译林中小学阅读丛书] 设计，无处不在（入选《中小学生阅读指导目录》）[可开发票]
There is a #PRS_ORG# certificate, which is not easy to pick up, and #PRS_ORG# falsely accused me, so I reapply once, and the one I submitted is a receipt.
"After your friend finishes, you don't have anyone to take them to deliver food, and then you're punishing me for asking you to immediately cancel it, otherwise I'll report it."
The translation of the given text from Chinese to English is as follows:  "The time-lapse photography has not yet been evaluated by store members."
[Effect] Photo effect: I took a picture of two-body clothing. Overall, it's not bad. I really like this outfit in the picture.  [Service] Service details: Since I was pregnant during makeup time, it was a bit uncomfortable. The makeup artist and the staff were very considerate. They let me rest for a while and kept giving me hot water to drink.
"Set price: 1000 yuan, thank you for your review, originally I said no to ancient wind not suitable for ancient wind, but I didn't expect the product to be so beautiful when it came out."
Thank you for Dan Dan's acknowledgement, your satisfaction will make us full of energy to continue moving forward. We will continue to work hard! This photography studio is really great, I strongly recommend all my friends to come!
No matter from greeting, makeup, clothing, lighting, photography to the end, there is nothing to pick and choose. Makeup artists are particularly skilled, they will match the style to create a suitable makeup look for you, and all makeup products are high-end brands.
Teacher Tianliang is no longer used to speak, photography is a comparable profession. The entire studio has an artistic atmosphere, and there are two small cats accompanying play and fun.
We are working in Beijing, and the good theaters in Beijing all need to queue up for half a year in advance. My colleagues have been shooting in Beijing and I saw their finished product and thought it was just so so. I deliberately sought out this workplace, a place with spirit and attitude.
Our facial expression management is not very good, I think this is also the case for most people. The photographer brother will capture and record the natural beautiful moments. Makeup artist, photographer, post-design, a perfect team.
"Everyone around me and I all clapped enthusiastically. I have already recommended the movie to others, and even after just watching the trailer, I am also very happy."
I hope this studio is not forgotten, and more people discover it, take pictures in their own style, instead of being a thousand copies. I am very grateful for the five-star reviews from Occupy and Jinglia, both of whom are very creative and have great ideas. We are a creative studio, as long as customers like us, we will do our best to complete the work, thank you for knowing and meeting.
Sweet and attentive assistant, lively and open-minded photography teacher, every team member is super nice and a beautiful experience. It's a difficult experience to forget, and the results are even better than I imagined. Everyone worked hard, and I'm grateful to all of you. Thank you, little universe, for your comments. Recognizing you is also a kind of fate. From Huanghe to Qinhuangdao, the trust we have in you is like a journey of thousands of kilometers. I'm happy to know you, and I hope you'll come back to Qinhuangdao to play again.
How should I give money? The resend meal has already been delivered.
"There is no one to pick up the phone when the restaurant staff calls me now."
A beginner programmer who wants to share their personal experiences. If you plan to enter the industry, it is recommended to find a place for training, but if you don't have any ideas, it is best to self-study. Training requires a lot of money and takes 6 months to learn.
However, if the intention is to enter this industry, training is indeed a very good choice, especially for those with weak self-discipline. Training is even a better choice. If one's self-discipline is relatively strong, one can also choose to self-study, but it will be more tiring.
Of course, choosing a good training institution is very important. First, you need to look at the teacher resources of this institution. If the teacher resources are not strong enough, this training institution has no meaning, of course some new opening training institutions teacher resources are not particularly strong.
Next, you should explore this training institution before making a decision. It's best to explore the students who have graduated from this institution to get a better understanding of this institution. After all, only the students of this institution can truly tell you about the quality of the courses taught here. Hello, actually, I don't know how to answer your question because I don't have enough information about your personal situation. Learning this thing is closely related to your personal situation.
For example, your major, age, the language you want to learn, and even the city you want to study or work in are all related to the industry you want to pursue. If you are a student who has not graduated yet or have graduated in computer science, and you have enough time, my personal suggestion is to self-study. This is the most efficient and cost-effective option. Nowadays, there are many good offline and online training institutions, but the cost is high, and the investment of time is quite a lot. It usually takes 3-6 months to complete the training.
However, if I were to speak of these situations, self-study would be very convenient. Nowadays, there are many free learning resources available on the internet, or you can go to Bilibili to find training resources. If you don't know how to find resources, you can also contact me through an introduction to get free resources, or you can also get detailed consultations. Additionally, there are some classic books that can be combined with videos for comprehensive learning.
If you are not a computer major but are willing to pay a certain amount of money and time for learning, it is recommended to go to a training institution. This way of learning is not very expensive, the teacher's explanation is very detailed, there are people who specialize in answering questions, and there is also help in planning and monitoring. Moreover, many training institutions now sign job placement agreements, have internal recommendations, and recommend students to companies after learning, which can greatly simplify the job search process.
That's my opinion. Since I don't know your situation, I only gave a general introduction, which was not detailed. If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me for further discussion and communication.
"I said I would arrive at 1 o'clock, but I saw everything in the App before then."
What are you doing while I haven't finished speaking?
I, accept various (installation, cleaning, repair), wall-mounted water heater, water purifier, washing machine, air conditioner, toilet, stove, oil stove, lamp accessories, professional seam stitching, thank you to those who silently praise me for my hard work in life. Life is tiring but we must continue.
Life will not punish anyone for their efforts, so why don't you pay attention to me? I appreciate those who silently praise me. Life is like this - people only look at the results, but we have to endure the process on our own. Facing life, we can only be strong, continue, and have no other choice. You can look back at the road, but you can't walk back.
Cleaning is both work and responsibility, life is beautiful because of service, and service is beautiful because of sincerity. We may do the dirtiest work, but we will clean every corner of the customer's home with the most sincere attitude, seeing the satisfied smile on the customer's face and the raised thumb, that moment all the tiredness is worth it, and there is a reward!
My daily work is your requirements, my service.
Pay attention to service, pay attention to cleanliness, keep the good. We take care of the details you care about and make them as "clean" as possible for you, with love for your family.
"Keep all families clean and tidy, take care of the trees and engrave the steles, be on time with the service and keep everything clean at home. Keep both indoor and outdoor clean, my daily work"
Although crystal lamps are beautiful, they will become dull and lose their light if not cleaned for a long time. Only by cleaning them can their brilliance be restored. Life is the same way; with diligence, one can achieve success, and with meticulous attention to detail, one can create perfection. The cracks in our lives are a testament to our sincerity.
"Give me a chance, and I'm sure you'll be satisfied. Quality speaks for itself, because professionalism is worth trusting. Your approval means the most to me. All businesses are bad right now!"
"However, I always believe that as long as you have a sincere attitude, persistence, and hard work, you will be better than others, at least a little bit. Come on, let's be positive!" "Tomorrow's plan is in the morning. I hope you carry with you happiness, luck, health, and success as you start a new day. Keep a good mood all day long. Good morning!"
In childhood, happiness is a thing to possess, and once you have it, you are happy. In adulthood, happiness becomes a goal to achieve, and once you achieve it, you are happy. But as you grow older, you realize that happiness was originally a mindset, and understanding it brings happiness. Be the most real and good version of yourself, follow your heart, and don't regret this life. Life is a journey, walk your own path. Life's two treasures: a healthy body and a happy mind, live brightly until old age!
Each stage of life presents different challenges. Often, what binds you is not your ability, but your courage to face them positively.
"Since you can't avoid it, why not face it directly? The more afraid you are, the more difficult it will be to overcome; if you embrace the challenge, the problem will eventually solve itself."
The first contemporary art biennial exhibition of Qatar, titled "Doha Contemporary Art Biennial 2021," was officially opened to the public on November 11 in the Doha JAX Art Zone, which is located in the northwest of Doha, the capital of Qatar. A total of 64 artists from Qatar, China, and other countries participated in the exhibition.
The current bi-annual exhibition is organized by the Saudi Binladin Group and the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, with Tian Xiaoyu, the director of UCCA Center for Contemporary Art, serving as the art director. According to the organizing team, the theme of this bi-annual exhibition is "Touching Stones to Cross the River," which symbolizes the reform strategies adopted during the period of social and economic transformation, as well as the current state of cultural development in Saudi Arabia.
The current bi-annual exhibition occupies nearly 12,000 square meters, with six connected buildings showcasing six units: "Touching Stones to Cross the River," "Inheritance as Experiment," "Edge Thinking," "Moving Toward the Public," "Beautiful New World," and "The Spirit of Art." Among them, the works of 27 Saudi artists make up more than 40% of the total exhibition, covering various forms such as painting, installation art, and performance art; 12 Chinese artists' works are also highly regarded, with some artists using recycled materials in innovative ways, such as Xu Bing in "The Backstory Series: Endless Mountains" (2014), who reconstructed a classic mountain landscape painting using discarded materials.
The chairman of the Beijing Biennale Foundation, Barclay, expressed his hope that this biennale would establish international dialogue, allowing global audiences to understand the cultural industry and creative community of Saudi Arabia's booming development, and enhance mutual exchanges. Tian Yu said: "The goal of the biennale is double-sided, both allowing contemporary art from Saudi Arabia to participate in global dialogue, and allowing Saudi audiences to immerse themselves in the contemporary art world."
I know that during the two-year exhibition opening period, a series of lectures will also be held. Artists, curators, and leaders in the creative industry will discuss topics such as cross-cultural communication and the development of contemporary art.
I bought an axe and went to a restaurant with it. The waiter told me that I couldn't send bones with my hand.
I would like to know the reason why the bone can be taken out and the restaurant can pack and deliver it separately.

Yunnan: Standardizing the Management of Public Welfare Positions in Villages - Xinhua News Agency Kunming December 12th, 2021 (Reporter Lin Bijian) To continuously improve employment opportunities for poor people and consolidate and expand the achievements of attacking poverty, Yunnan Province recently issued policies to promote the management of public welfare positions in villages, which will help to comprehensively promote village revitalization.
The Yunnan Provincial People's Bureau has released an introduction to the responsible persons for the development of public welfare positions in villages. Currently, Yunnan has developed 44,830 public welfare positions for the employment of disadvantaged rural labor force and other difficult groups in villages. These positions play an important role in helping disadvantaged groups find employment, increasing their income, consolidating their anti-poverty achievements, and effectively improving the public service capabilities of villages in various aspects. This new rule has been jointly issued by the Yunnan Provincial People's Bureau, the Rural Revitalization Bureau, and the Finance Bureau, among others, and mainly aims to standardize the recruitment of village public welfare position personnel, financial management, position development, and position management.
In terms of development position settings, the new rules are clear, following the principles of "on-demand posting, based on job definition, dynamic management, and total quantity control," "who develops, who uses, and who is responsible," and "one person per post, self-voluntary disclosure, and unified management." The recruitment program must follow the steps of announcement, application, review, publicity, employment, pre-training before posting, and arrangement of posting.
In addition, the new rules have clearly defined the specific responsibilities of the departments in charge of developing rural public welfare positions, the standards and methods of subsidies for rural public welfare positions, and required each department in charge of developing rural public welfare positions to purchase accident insurance for rural public welfare position settlers. It is also required that related departments regularly monitor the situation of subsidy payments for rural public welfare positions.
"Wrong address. Hello."
Is it possible to cancel my order so that I can place it again?
Is it cancelled?
Although the right wing has had its moments in history, it is short-lived because it is dazzled by a little sunshine and sweats a little water. As soon as it gets its bearings, it is prone to being attacked and its spirit is dampened. However, in reality, the right wing plays a positive role in the process of social progress.
From defining the truth standards after the end of the Cultural Revolution, developing the economy, improving technology, promoting political systemization and protecting human rights, the positive significance of the right-wing should not be denied. Three, in my opinion, although I do not completely agree with some of Li Weidong's statements, I am very interested in his statements, and I highly respect Li Weidong as a person; because he is sincere, he is sincere about China, and he is sincerely concerned about the social issues of China.
However, I oppose his anti-communist theory, I believe that revolution is necessary, revolution is inevitably accompanied by social turbulence, people's lives are harmed, political organizations are chaotic and mixed with mud and sand, and finally, foreign countries take advantage of the chaos to enter. Four, changing or improving China requires patience and a sense of responsibility for the country and the people, political speculation attempts to take advantage of the chaos, that is not the right-wing, but the mixed egg.
Let's talk about the left. The left, in fact, are the orphans of their time and politics.
If the right has a positive meaning for society, the Communist Party will still listen to some right-wing opinions and analyze their thoughts at the right time, and the left will not have been corrupted, because what the left wants is exactly what the Communist Party has thrown away. Five, I recently saw some friends criticizing counter-revolutionaries and rejecting left-wing madness, and they were also full of vigor. I think it's not necessary.
Don't try to reason with traitors or leftists, they're just a bunch of stubborn people. Don't try to prove that we're right, and don't even think about making the rebels and leftists admit it. Why bother?
I would tell my friends: when a counterrevolutionary curses you as a five-mao, when a leftist curses you as a right dog, that proves our middle path is correct! Many people had ideals in their youth, but forgot them as they grew older, or pursued them but became dogmatic.
The gap between reality and idealism gradually widens, and even the young dragon eventually becomes an evil dragon. I think left and right generally indicate constraints and freedom, and China, due to its historical and cultural roots, should be generally left-leaning.
However, the right-wing in China values efficiency and development, while the left-wing emphasizes monitoring, fairness, and safety. Currently, society as a whole hopes to pay more attention to fairness, but at the same time, there is tension between China and the United States, and the left-wing is definitely the case. It is estimated that it will continue for many years.
Although I don't understand, giving a thumbs up is enough, and there's no need to say anything else, just like flowers have their own righteousness.
"It's too late to order at 19:06, it's been 2 hours already 😅"
Today let's take a look at some [weird trending topics]. What is normal public opinion?
Randomly select three hot searches: "Two-headed dragons in February," "Rising prices of beautiful friends," and "The Hualala event," the wave of public opinion formed a peak, and then the exponential decline (smooth curve) eventually dissipated. If there is a secondary public opinion, a small peak may appear again. They look different from the network public opinion evolution model shown by the netinfo official website.
What is abnormal sentiment? Select six random events and present them in a "peak," "toothed," or "cliff" shape.
The text can be translated to English as follows:  - 孤峰状: This refers to a sudden surge in popularity, quickly rising to the top of the search rankings and attracting public attention. - 锯齿状: This refers to a periodic surge in popularity, ensuring that the topic remains on the search rankings. - 断崖状: This refers to a mass withdrawal, indicating that the hot search has fulfilled its function and is ready to move on to new tasks and new battlefields. In Figure 9, the peak of an event's popularity coincides with the trough of another event's popularity, with no time difference, indicating that a unified batch of water troops has been assigned to the task and launched a new offensive.
The specialization of black PR can be seen in black and white: several hot searches appear on the list at the same time, which ones attract attention, which ones are responsible for explaining science, which ones provoke controversy, which ones divert attention, which ones affect cognition, which ones mislead judgment, which ones arouse emotions, which ones wrap up decisions, black production accounts are divided into batches and nodes, considering all the elements of the spread of public opinion. Propaganda is a science, throwing away subjective factors such as stance and emotion, only from objective data, black PR will have no place to hide.
"Every footstep leaves a trace, and these traces, we dig out together. Data source: hot search time machine."
The first cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the new coronavirus have been reported in Mauritius, Seychelles, and Malawi.
On the 10th, Mao Liqusi reported the first two cases of infection with the Omicron variant in China. According to the introduction by Mao Weishengbu Long Kaishu Gupao, one infected person arrived in Mao Liqusi from South Africa on November 27th; the other infected person is a local resident of Mao Liqusi who came into contact with a person who had recently returned from South Africa on November 30th, and was confirmed positive through nucleic acid testing.
After being isolated and treated in the hospital, the results of the nucleic acid tests for these two infected persons have turned negative. They have now returned to their respective residences. The Shenzhen Health and Family Planning Commission announced on the 10th that China has confirmed its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus.
These three people are all students, who returned from traveling in Europe at the beginning of this month. Due to their light illness, they have not been hospitalized for treatment. In order to prevent the spread of the Omicron virus, the government of Saudi Arabia has continuously increased its control measures.
From December 6th to January 10th, all travelers aged 12 and above who arrive by plane must pay for a nucleic acid test at the airport. The National Health Commission announced on the 10th that it will start vaccinating children aged 5 to 11 with the Pfizer new coronavirus vaccine.
The Malawi Ministry of Health announced on September 9th that the country had found its first three cases of infection with the Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus. The Ministry of Health in Malawi conducted genetic sequencing on 12 positive COVID-19 samples collected between November 9th and December 2nd, and discovered these three cases of infection.

"When you receive an order with gold money in your belly, it's a phoenix."
Okay, the phone number is #PHONENUMBER# Do you need me to stay in the conversation?
I called the staff to explain the situation.
"Your messenger told me that the address is too far away."
The address of the Dàměi 360 integrated home decoration store is: Héngchéngnǎn lù 156 huǒfújiā yuán 12 lóu.
"At first, it was a friend's introduction because of trust, so I chose to take a look at the initial budget of 7,000 for basic decoration. When I arrived at the store, I started a series of deception tactics."
I visited the store for the first time and only showed them my floor plan. They didn't physically inspect the house, but they were able to give me a quote for my 135-square-meter house for 7 million yuan. I looked at their materials briefly, but I didn't know what brand they were using. Their second scam was that as soon as you go to the store, they will drag you into paying the deposit (and once you pay the deposit, you can never leave, unless you have enough experience and can argue with them).
I was hesitating whether to pay the deposit or not, and then they invited their so-called manager to tell me that I would get a certain discount if I paid the deposit today. This is a big pit, and I am a living example of being scammed, in a state of confusion, I paid more than ten thousand deposits.
He gave me a quote with many issues. The price does not include water and electricity renovation, any doors and cabinets, and these three are the main costs for the basic decoration. Besides, their service point fees are higher than other companies.
I lost trust in this company. At the beginning, they didn't explain anything clearly and made me sign the contract. When I went to ask for my money back, they acted very experienced and had a special team to deal with me.
Regardless of how it happens, it is always the customer's problem and they have no responsibility. There are many ways to shift responsibility and a lot of details, but I don't want to go into it one by one because it's all tears. In the end, don't choose them because my friend found them to decorate their house and the quality is not good. They will calculate various costs for you later.
"Bro, they're the same scam artists who used to decorate with fake dragons, now they're all pretty and look like they've gone out of business again. So don't choose this crappy decorating company."
Afterwards, everyone should Baidu search these consultations before making a decision because renovation is not a small amount of money. If you want to ask the merchant, please first log in or register.
"It is strictly prohibited to publish various forms of merchant reviews, please refer to the merchant recruitment statement on the Kunming Decoration and Design Channel for the latest information on merchants, including addresses, phone numbers, and business hours. Find a decoration company and post a review on the Kunming Decoration and Design Channel."
This is so scary! If it's not going to be delivered within 30 minutes, please cancel the order!
Is there no other method left? For example, change the address?
Alright, if you don't refund my money within 5 to 10 days, I will definitely investigate.
"Can I cancel within 15 minutes?"
The chicken should be cooked, but the received one is raw, so it can't be eaten.
I have not received a response after 3 days... because your system cannot recognize my credit card, so I cannot join the #PRS_ORG# plus monthly fee plan! It's strange that every time I pay, I always use the same credit card.
"Can I first waive the shipping fees and then have you collect my monthly fees after you finish investigating, like this?"
How can I contact the delivery person?
Is it 3 o'clock yet? Do I need compensation?
I said I would knock on the door to deliver goods, but the courier just left them at the doorstep, and then the person walked away.
The text "还送错" translates to "I apologize" in English.
"Your delivery person has already picked up your order at #NUMBER#, but they are still telling you that the delivery person is still waiting at 19:25 to deliver your order, but they are not willing to leave."
"After I finish buying, do you want to order other takeout?"
"Where did your bike go? Do you still need to wait?"
"I am going to send you a goodbye message, you won't cancel it, I will report it."
However, my food may have safety and hygiene issues.

"You can redeem the discount code by returning it, there's no problem with that. Just remember not to resend it, I've already bought it separately, I don't want to waste it."
Thank you for your help.
From the past to the present, I have always opposed any form of slander and insult, and I cannot accept such behavior. In a civilized society, we can tolerate everything, but we must absolutely reject this kind of evil.
If you don't look at the political party and faction, the first thing to resist is this kind of uncivilized behavior. From the moment you started sending Facebook friend requests and posting insulting posts, I have already taken a non-responsive attitude.
"After you, you continued to tag me relentlessly according to the frequency of six meals a day, and you continued to recklessly discuss with your so-called friends on Facebook about some hidden and humiliating things about me, such as appearance, body shape, health, bedding with strawberries, should or should not, and so on. I... I've had enough. How do I know later that many of my friends sent you a photo of your Facebook friend account with a photo of you and some sexually suggestive comments?"
I'm sorry, as a woman, I can no longer remain silent. After my news report was uploaded, you didn't calm down at all, but instead became more and more loud.
I don't care about your political background or your identity status in our society. Regardless, in our society, both genders need to be respected. Yes, you can continue with your sarcastic, hidden, shameful, and insulting remarks. You can continue to say that you only love and care about me, and you can continue to deny that it is harassment, and you can even continue to publish offensive remarks.
No, I cannot, and I have no ability to stop you. I don't know you, and I don't want to know you. My appearance and physique don't need your criticism.
I don't believe there is any girl who would willingly let someone ridicule her in such a way to gain fame. My friend asked me, are you okay?
I said hello, you won't believe me. I think there won't be any girl who can say she's okay after being bullied like that.
No matter in work, society, politics or business, only those who lack basic morals would choose to harm any woman in this way. I believe that justice is inherent in the heart.
I cut off part of your comments for everyone to review, and no one should be able to impersonate you, right?
"I can only say that you are a civilized enemy with a heart of gold."
I have reported and attached the picture, but there is no reply.

"The 2021 China International Rail Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Industry Talent Summit opened in Changsha on December 9th."
The Vice-Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee and the Director-General of the Hunan Provincial Organizational Department, Wang Cheng, attended the opening ceremony and gave a speech. Wang Cheng pointed out that holding the Hunan Talent Summit is an important measure to implement the spirit of the Central People's Work Conference and the 12th Hunan Provincial Party Congress, which highlights Hunan's emphasis on talent, desire for talent, and good use of talent.
Hunan has a long-standing tradition of recognizing, valuing, respecting, and nurturing talent, which serves as a broad and open platform for talent development, and provides ideal environmental conditions for a beautiful life. In recent years, Hunan has deeply implemented the strategy of talent-led development, guided by the "Pomegranate Talent Action Plan", and built a complete chain of talent recruitment, cultivation, and retention, which has become the fertile ground for talent growth, the hotbed for innovation and entrepreneurship, and the comfortable and prosperous land for living and working. Currently, Hunan is comprehensively implementing the "Three Highs and Four New" strategic positioning and mission tasks, and will further open the door to talent recruitment, introduce more favorable policies for talent innovation and entrepreneurship, concentrate more resources, and create better conditions, looking forward to the joint efforts of excellent talents from all walks of life to make Hunan a high-quality development center with wisdom and strength.
The exhibition venues set up at the activity site included the Longsha, Kabu, Xiangtan Exhibition Hall, and Hunan Self-Trade Test Zone Exhibition Hall. The Hunan Provincial Science and Technology Department, Hunan Provincial Information Department, and Hunan Provincial People's Social Department issued a list of key innovation needs for advanced manufacturing related industries, a directory of talent requirements for intelligent manufacturing industry, and a directory of talent requirements for doctoral stations in intelligent manufacturing industry. Forty-eight large enterprises, including China Southern Automobile, China National Heavy Duty Vehicle, and Far East Technology, recruited talent on-site. Nearly a thousand related major graduates and social talent participated in the talent project interface.
