The cost of the goods is less than 20 euros. The fee is 40% of the value of the goods.
I am a large customer and therefore it is not a problem for me. All I need is a number or instructions on how I should label the package so that it can be tracked by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€. Today it costs 179€.
I have to admit, I find that very frustrating. Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it at a better price, or is there another option for a refund?
I generally believe that it should not be expected of children to take on the role of parents for their younger siblings. However, I think it is good for older siblings to take care of the younger ones to some extent.
Look briefly, help briefly, bring the bottle etc. So they learn responsibility, help in the family and are connected.
As long as you are still young enough to be a child, I see no problem. If your K1 is busy alone for a short time and it's okay for him, then that's good too.
You are the best judge to determine if it is suitable for your children. It is not the case that he should wrap them in K2 and accompany them for hours during their nap time.
Legally, it is probably questionable. Perhaps that's why the psychologist's statement comes into play.
If something were to actually happen like a fire, burglary, earthquake, alien invasion, etc., it would be too much responsibility for K1 to take care of K2. Whether that's a risk you're willing to take is of course up to you ;)
Could you please help me find the title of a book I read a while back? I remember reading a crime/thriller and I can recall almost the entire plot, but the title just escapes me. Maybe someone here knows it.
The story was about fear and how to treat it. At the beginning of the story, a animal caretaker commits suicide by pouring food over himself and going into the enclosure with his feral cats.
The case is taken over by a commissioner who, after a short investigation, comes to the therapist who runs a clinic where he treats patients with anxiety. The commissioner has a small niece who also has anxiety (of fire) and ends up with this therapist.
There is an increase in suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is anonymously commissioned to go to the scene of each suicide and document it, then post the photos on the internet. However, it turns out that this therapist is actually running an underground therapy group where patients have a chip planted in their heads that suppresses an anxiety center, and they ultimately confront their anxiety in the most extreme way.
(A woman jumps out of a window, another drives intentionally to her death) This will be referred to as "the fight" in the book due to fear.
At the end, there is a big showdown in the hospital that had something to do with fire. That's just the rough plot, I'm pretty sure the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If someone knows about this action or even tells me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, I don't have the Wi-Fi password with me. I need to contact my husband first.
That could take a while. What steps should I take next?
Is it also possible to have the price difference refunded?
The child, four years old, has wooden splinters under the thumbnail (outside).
I tried to catch him with a pair of tweezers. It was very difficult to grab him.
It didn't work and it caused pain. Now the child reacts hysterically when we try it.
There's no chance left. I'm going to the doctor tomorrow.

Due to Omicron: Johnson will push for booster vaccinations to keep new cases coming in Politics and Science in Great Britain.
By New Year, all qualified adults in England should receive an immunization offer. London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson intends to accelerate the Corona booster immunizations faster than previously planned due to the rapidly increasing Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should have the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided at least three months have passed since the second vaccination, Johnson said in a pre-recorded video message to his fellow citizens. The previous deadline was the end of January.
The British government will provide additional support so that the vaccination campaigns are accelerated in the regions of Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. We are facing a crisis with the Omicron variant, which is why it is urgently necessary to strengthen the vaccination protection, said Johnson.
The good news is that the protection level can be increased with a third booster dose. "Let's get boosted now!", said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 more Omicron cases were registered in Great Britain, increasing the total to 3137. This represents an increase of 65% compared to the previous day. dpa
Will the full amount be refunded from the purchase price upon pickup?
I am for the fact that everyone presents themselves with pronouns. I have sent out an application.
Today I received an invitation to a conversation via email. I will respond to the email.
Unfortunately, the name is not "Peter," but a more complicated one. I looked it up on the internet, and depending on where he/she comes from culturally, it's either a man or a woman.
I don't know how to write this email now. Can someone please help me?
I am a foreigner and I don't want any official to step on my feet. Conclusion: everyone should imagine themselves with pronouns.
I have a total of 5 books. 4 of them are going.
"Only one thing that I bought today is not going."
It seems that the chair had an invisible defect in sales. How can such a damage to the upholstery occur after 9 months?
First on the #PRS_ORG# it tries. It works since about
14 days ago. That's why I bought the last books online and then read them on #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8, but there were none left.
"Now they are available again, and I would like to add two chairs to the order and have it charged to me."
The feeling when I cannot help. Content warning: I will be writing in detail about domestic violence.
I just have to write something about the soul. I (21) come into contact with the victims (and perpetrators) of domestic violence more often due to professional reasons.
A theme that bothers me a lot and unfortunately occurs too frequently is that many victims do not allow themselves to be helped or we think we cannot help them. It is clear to me that we cannot do everything and it is not perfect.
However, there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than when I am unable to do anything in such situations. I see the blue stains, the blood, the desperate eyes...
However, in conversation with four eyes, with the perpetrator far out of sight and hearing range, I cannot reach all of them. I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of revenge, fear of leaving behind the familiar social environment, fear of taking the children away from it.
What I always want to make clear, which is sometimes very close to my tears, is that all of it is worth living without violence. I want all women to know that they don't have to just accept violence.
Often I wish I could help in every case... I know I can't. It becomes easier that way, but never.
Please, always remember that it is valuable to live without violence, that is so incredibly important.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's the point of the series based on "League of Legends"? A lot of fantasy, many complicated names, a breathtaking setup: "Arcane", the series set in the universe of the "League of Legends" video game, has recently started on Netflix.
Why are we looking forward to the already announced two staffel?
Basketball Bundesliga: Merlins Crailsheim Derby-Debacle for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at least Youngster Johannes Patrick was absent.
Nothing again: For the second time in less than three months, the giants in Crailsheim lost - and how! Ludwigsburg's trainer John Patrick had said before the game, looking back on the cup loss in early October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: "We still have something anger in our stomach."
She did not lie down after the game, but instead raised herself again in view of the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. However, more than just the result disappointed the way of appearance.
A statistic can be called to represent the entire dilemma: The three-quote was only 13%, with four hits (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts. Are there any more questions? The answer from John Patrick: "We were not concentrated enough after the win in Tenerife and did not implement what we had trained."
Specifically, moving the ball. Sebastian Gleim's counterpart reacted differently: "Winning a great game against Ludwigsburg for the second time," said the happy coach.
"It felt like there were 10,000 people." Despite only 750 visitors being allowed at the Hohenlohe-Arena on Saturday, they managed to cover their costs.
Lastly, also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. "The best playmaker I've ever trained," praised Gleim.
During Patrick's team itself, the performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) failed on the entire line. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a total debacle and come within eight points, after they had already been 39:59 behind.
Besides Johannes Patrick, there was also Justin Simon with twelve points. Fortunately, there is still a lot of time left for squabbling.
The Riesen received the Skyliners Frankfurt on Wednesday (8 pm), with a maximum of 750 spectators in Ludwigsburg beforehand.
We had an earlier email address, but I changed it.
Yes, I had already registered a few months ago. Unfortunately, all warranty claims were rejected.
We have informed ourselves legally again and have written to them for that reason. We originally reported ourselves a half year ago.
Always like chiseled from an egg: Max Raabe turns 59 and manages to captivate his audience with new interpretations of songs from the 20s and 30s.
Currently, he is on his way with the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" - if he can show up. Actually, Max Raabe wanted to celebrate his birthday on stage in Leipzig on this Sunday.
However, nothing comes out of it. The planned concert has been postponed to May 2022 - "by official order", to prevent the spread of the Corona virus.
The website of the singer, who is turning 59 today, and his musicians (www.palast-orchester.de) states that other performances that were planned during the Advent season must be postponed. The artists plan to make up for the 2020 dates that were postponed due to the pandemic in January.
Max Raabe was born on December 12, 1962, in Lünen, North Rhine-Westphalia, and has been singing with pleasure since his youth. He studied opera singing in Berlin and founded the Palast Orchester together with his classmates in 1986.
Since then, the baritone has established himself with his repertoire of swing songs and chansons in the style of the Comedian Harmonists. He has been awarded many prizes.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) reached the second spot on the charts, just like his successful album "Für Frauen ist das kein Problem" (2013). He managed to bring it from a niche to the mainstream.
Max Raabe, dressed elegantly with his blonde hair tightly combed and labeled, is a well-known figure in the current German-speaking music scene. With the program "Guten Tag, liebes Glück" he has been on tour since 2020. dpa
Hello #NAME#, is it also possible to receive a small sample of the furniture wood in advance? So that we can match it with existing furniture and check if it matches color-wise before making a purchase.
It's still not working. I can only see the cover but not turn the pages.
Bundesbauministerin Klara Geywitz: Expropriation does not create new housing. The new Federal Minister for Housing, Klara Geywitz (SPD), has spoken out against the expropriation of large housing corporations, as has been proposed in a popular vote in Berlin.
"Expropriation does not create a new housing unit, it only changes the ownership structure," said Geywitz in an interview with the "Tagesspiegel" (Sunday). My goal is to give tenants security that their rent will be affordable in the next few years.
A colorful mix of, for example, private landlords, cooperatives or housing societies is actually the best protection against monopoly formation. In Berlin, the coalition of SPD, Greens and Left Party wants to set up an expert commission on how to deal with the result of the popular vote.
If the situation does not calm down, Geywitz held talks with the FDP in the coalition government about further strengthening the rental law. The coalition agreement provides for a rental price brake until 2029, a limitation on rent increases in tense housing markets, and the expansion of the rental index.
I will speak with the Justice Minister to implement it as quickly as possible. If the rental market does not relax, "we will talk with our coalition partners about further steps," emphasized the SPD politician.
Hello, I wanted to place an order and I realized after a few days that I had forgotten the last step in payment. Unfortunately, the product is no longer available.
Do you know when it will be available again? Or if it will come back at all?
#PRS_ORG# with storage space (180 x #NUMBER# cm),
The coupon sounds great, then I'll add it to the new order on my own.
Thank you for the quick clarification!
If the lamp is sent in March, how long does the shipping take?
I have already cut myself on my finger. That's an absolute audacity.
At least 100 people were killed by tornados in Kentucky during a devastating storm system in the USA.
Alone in Kentucky, more than 100 deaths could be mourned. The images from there remind of a war zone.
On Friday night in the United States, several tornados caused severe damage and may have resulted in up to 100 deaths. The storms left a trail of destruction approximately 320 kilometers long, mainly in the state of Kentucky.
Governor Andy Beshear of that state said after a visit to the disaster area, everywhere where the tornado had passed through, everything was gone. Houses, shops, government buildings - just gone.
Parts of industrial equipment, roofs are in the trees. It is difficult to imagine that this is possible at all.
He counts alone in the state of Kentucky up to a hundred dead, the official numbers are increasing hourly.
Hello, I just saw that Vitrine #NAME# is sold out. That's too bad.
Is it still being produced, or has it been completely removed from the assortment?
Is it possible to order this vitrine in another country?
When would you like to sign up? If the delivery cannot be made to my apartment, I will have to cancel the order!
I understand, can I place the order for the ceiling now and have it delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had submitted the contact form or given a return and wanted to inquire if it arrived or was processed, as I had not yet received any confirmation.
Companies pay vaccination incentives and change advertising slogans While the federal government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination incentive, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees financial incentives for vaccination.
With this, they are on the same line with the social partners ÖGB and Wirtschaftskammer, who today called for financial incentives for vaccination. Also, the transformation of advertising slogans into vaccination appeals - in the German model - should increase the readiness for Corona vaccinations.
He switched to a company where he was mistreated. That doesn't improve his situation any better than yours.
Waiting and drinking tea. It's been a year.
He obviously didn't stick to his old job and looked for something else. You can do that too.
And even though he didn't find you good back then, that's okay. He didn't find his job good either.
There are too many variables.
Please stop the cancellation. Then it will actually be relevant.
I am taking a screenshot.

Hello and welcome to your first Boron campaign!
I am currently leading a group of 4 friends on an adventure over the Griffon's Pass and want to seamlessly transition my heroes into a campaign specifically written for players. We are playing DSA 5.
The big arch is complete, the villains and their motivations are written, the individual acts are planned, and now I am starting to write the adventure and am already stumbling over my own feet at the first encounter. The premise is that the heroes are supposed to bring a cartload of grain from Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-See.
The further development of the plot will take place there. A group of Goblins will ambush the hero a few miles away from the village and lure them into a trap.
I want to give the player character the ability to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten, recognize danger early, whatever the players come up with. Group strength: 8 normal goblins, 2 with spears, 6 with bows and swords armed.
If the heroes are not noticed, the goblins lie in wait for them in a hollow path and flank them with three bows on both sides, while two of them stop the carriage with spears. If a fight were to break out and the heroes were to lose, I have two solutions.
The heroes are found unconscious and later by the son of the village schoolteacher, a half-elf, and healed. The cart is of course gone.
If a defeat was inevitable, this half-elf with two of his servants suddenly appeared and came to the hero's aid in battle. The cart is still there, everything is great.
How do you hold the Deus ex Machina from Solution 2? Is the encounter as an introduction to the adventure too much?
The Goblins group will play a decisive role later, so they are not just cannon fodder.  EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will definitely cherish many of your ideas and now I have more trust in my narratives.
I took the lamp apart again and put it back together.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work. Despite this, I would still like to send it back.
Can you let me have the receipts so I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#?

I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1. Hello F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to express my frustration with this post.
For the first time today, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race in the middle to start the F1 warm-up on time. Despite the delayed start and the accident, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!).
It seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE here had no choice. Stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the end of the race.
Despite the small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule knowledge mistake by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag the tires could be changed.
Although there was this situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen could change his tires when they received corresponding radio messages about this topic from Hamilton. Both commentators at Sky UK and RTL immediately knew that this was possible for Verstappen.
I believe that such basic rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a Pay-TV channel. It's not the first time to guess what is allowed or prescribed by the rules, both have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.
Generally, I don't like the commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. But seriously, I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL.
There are constant absurdities that both look unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuHD" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter brings a lot of chaos to the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously.
Lastly, advertising takes over at Sky, during the final round, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV where only the German audio track without commentary comes directly after the race, neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two channels do less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel. Although we must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages.
The rest of the program on Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster to transmit F1.
Ironically, RTL does a better job with the races it broadcasts, except for advertising. So at least the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would with a reasonable broadcaster.
I would like to hear your opinion once.
"To here: #PRS_ORG#-Pendelleuchte, Messing und mehrfarbiges Glas x 1"
Hello, I have an article that was supposed to be delivered last week and is still not delivered. I have contacted the chat twice and so far nothing.
The First Lady told me that it will be sent on Monday, the Second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an email and she never replied.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on December 12th, 19. One of them has already shown a defect (the material has a hole on the front of the stool).
I am requesting support.
Air pumps are excellent for providing additional oxygen to an aquarium. Additionally, it is possible to operate a filtration system using an air lifter.
This series is offered in 3 variants. You can see the details in the table at the end of the offer.
There you can compare the services. If the pumps are strong enough, the entire equipment can be operated with them.
If one has a large aquarium, pumps with two or more outlets are suitable to attach multiple outlets. The MK-series has one, two, or four outlets, depending on the model. Lüfterpumpen can also be used to add an accent to the aquarium, such as with a Luftvorhang (which can be found in our shop) or with a decor that converts the air bubbles into a function.
Here there would be a treasure chest, shell or something similar to name. The MK-series has a special, soundproof construction and therefore ensures low operating noises.
The installation is very simple. The blower pump is connected to an exhaust port using a 4/6 mm hose...and it's ready to go.
The blower pump should be at the same level or higher than the water surface, and placed outside. If the blower pump is lower than the water level, a return valve should be placed between them.
To simply cut through the air hose and place the ventilator in between would prevent it from working properly if water were to flow backwards through it, which would cause the water to be pumped out of the tank.
If the blower pump were placed outdoors, it should be covered and protected from moisture, like other air pumps. The pumps in the MK series are pure power packages that consume little energy.
Even though we specify a processing time of 3 days on eBay, the packages are packed and picked up daily. If everything runs smoothly, it goes very quickly.
We just want to take a little precaution so that no one gets upset because it took a little longer. It's just that not everyone understands the whole team that works in logistics...of course, here Corona doesn't hold anything.
Please do not evaluate negatively just because the delivery is delayed, it is solely due to the packaging services. We often criticize these services, even though we say at the moment...they have made it difficult.
This is also very different regionally. Be nice to no one, stay healthy, and we all hope that there will be better times again.
How long does it take to order yellow with or without armrests? Can we also order the legs in bright colors here?
Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, sends his daughter and a moderator into space. The daughter of the first American in space, a TV moderator, and four other passengers took a short trip into space.
They were transported on Saturday by the "New Shepard" rocket system from Blue Origin, founded by Jeff Bezos. The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the western part of the US state of Texas.
Under a shining blue sky, Bezos personally welcomed the newly trained astronauts upon their return. "Welcome back," he said, dressed in a blue space suit, as he opened the hatch to the capsule.
The six passengers climbed out of the spacecraft one by one and embraced the founder of Amazon. According to Blue Origin, they were in space for 10 minutes and 13 seconds and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronaut Alan Shepard (1923-1998), for whom the Blue Origin rocket system is named, and the 50-year-old TV host Michael Strahan were honored guests at the company. The other four passengers had paid for their tickets: space engineer Dylan Taylor, investor Evan Dick, technology entrepreneur Lane Bess, and his son Cameron. Blue Origin did not disclose how much each person paid for their ticket.
Laura Shepard Churchley remembered her father's mission after the flight. He had to work hard and do everything himself during his missions.
The 74-year-old said with a laugh, "You just flew along so easily." Michael Strahan also expressed his enthusiasm.
The moderator said, "He would love to return to space again, specifically to go back to the All." "New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers in height.
The "New Shepard" rocket system flies mostly autonomously. The capsule separated from the rocket during flight reached an altitude of approximately 100 kilometers above Earth, experiencing weightlessness at times, before the reusable object was slowed down by large parachutes and landed safely.
The International Air Transport Association and many other experts consider 100 kilometers above the Earth as the boundary to space, however, there is no binding international regulation. It was already the third manned flight from Blue Origin: The first in July had Amazon founder Bezos on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old former US pilot, and an 18-year-old Dutchman.
In October, during the second flight, was the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner, known for his role as "Captain Kirk" in "Star Trek," as well as former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, entrepreneur Glen de Vries, and Blue Origin's deputy CEO, Audrey Powers. Critics accuse Bezos and Blue Origin of promoting space tourism without scientific research interests for the benefit of humanity and without regard for the environment.
By pressing the button, you can easily choose whether your "Smart Stone" should remain lit in a fixed color or play through its entire color palette. When set to change color, the stone retains a light color for about a minute before smoothly transitioning to the next decorative color.
The solid construction of the 'Smart Stone' light ensures that it remains functional all year round in outdoor environments. In particular, its light performs exceptionally well in snowy surroundings. However, it should be noted that the lighting duration will be shorter as soon as the days get shorter.
Please be careful in winter not to let any snow affect the functionality of the solar module. "Smart Stone" uses a NiMh-battery in the standard Mignon (»AA«) format, which can be easily replaced when needed.
You can get a suitable replacement battery from our webshop and extend the usage time of your decorative lights further.

I am currently studying Biochemistry in the first semester and find the subject quite interesting. Even in the lab, I don't get bothered. I have already completed the practicals for anorganic chemistry.
I had already informed myself about career prospects before starting my studies, at that time I also thought that I would study until my promotion and who would be. But now I have doubts, especially because of the career prospects.
On one hand, we often hear about great career opportunities, and on the other hand, we often hear about unemployed biologists and poorly paid jobs. Therefore, I would be really interested in:
1) What are you working on currently? 2) Are you satisfied with your work/salary?
3) What did you study/What kind of training did you complete? 4) Would you do it all over again?
Thank you for your answers! I am currently unsure and considering whether to drop out of my studies in 2022 and pursue an apprenticeship as a Fachinformatikerin.
If you have experiences, write them down too :)
The topic of extra stress before holidays and weekend ends came up for me last week.
I had to use my long weekend now to relax. That's why I'm going to a chair now.
Not only during big holidays, like Christmas break, there is stress in our business. It seems like there is also stress before holidays plus bridge days.
It was actually like this: Last week was Mariä Himmelfahrt, which is called "Aufahrt" in Switzerland. On Friday, most people and businesses take a bridge day, which is semi-official.
Last week, there was a long 4-day weekend at home. What did you do last week?
Everywhere stress. Endless emails that had to be sent out before leaving, tasks here and there, everything *absolutely* had to be done before the long weekend.
"Because... yes because? Because 'next week then' sounds so far away and that can't be?"
Or because people are so serious in a short week that they want to accomplish as much as in a normal one? Not only was I stressed on Wednesday, but also extremely exhausted.
What is this self-sacrifice for holidays? What is the point of having holidays if we cannot enjoy them properly?!
The stress came unexpectedly, the colleagues were all quite independent. My question is simply: Are we Swiss like that?
Is this our reformed-evangelical tradition? Or do you know it in the North as well?
Yvonne Catterfeld is excited for Christmas in Thüringen, but she still doesn't have any gifts.
"The beautiful, even if there is no snow in Erfurt, then you just drive to Ilmenau in the Thuringian Forest," said the actress and singer Hit Radio FFH. She would focus on the festival by baking and whistling with her son.
"Ich liebe das", said Catterfeld. Until the thoughtful days she still had something to do: "For the first time, I still have no gifts, I finally have to let go."
NEKTON-Bio supports a smooth process of molting and feather regeneration. NEKTON-Bio contains all the necessary vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements, and 200,000 µg biotin/kg.
Nekton-Bio gives the bird a smooth and shiny feather. Most of the feather damages that occur in birdkeeping are due to feeding errors.
Since feathers are made of protein-rich substance, it is particularly important for the bird to have a nutritious and balanced diet that is rich in protein. In order for the metabolism to function properly, the daily food intake must contain sufficient vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
A large part of the animal losses that occur during moulting are due to insufficient or imbalanced protein intake and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals. In the composition of NEKTON-Bio, the unfavorable ratio of amino acids in most plant-based feeds is explicitly considered and balanced.
While using NEKTON-Bio, no additional vitamin preparation should be administered. NEKTON-Bio is soluble in cold water and can easily be added to drinking water or soft food.
Thank you, I have found the function, unfortunately it still doesn't work.
Yes, the F-parts are mine. I received a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part. The middle beam is held by two feet. Unfortunately, these are too narrow and the beam cannot be mounted on the feet.
What are we doing now? I can't make the bed.
The middle section is held by two feet, unfortunately they are produced incorrectly. The middle section does not fit into the intended holding device.
Additionally, I will receive new ones. When will they be sent out?
"No flat ones. According to the mounting instructions, these are the correct ones, they were just too narrow."
"But that doesn't matter. The main thing is that they fulfill their purpose."
Can't you send them to me? They're not flat.
Hello #NAME#, would you like me to explain the problem again?
There was a house fire in Oberbayern that resulted in two people being lightly injured and significant damage.
Additionally, a damage in the range of six-digit Euros has occurred, as the police announced on Sunday. The fire seems to have spread from a carport to the adjacent residential house in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were reportedly brought to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning. The exact cause of the fire was initially unknown, but the police did not rule out an intentional arson.
The Kripo Fürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigation.
Then she comes much later, and I have to pay shipping costs again.
To combat fake news - Biontech CEO releases vaccination photo Uğur Şahin released a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021.
Uğur Şahin, the CEO of Biontech, has not publicly stated his vaccination status until now. The entrepreneur has now released a photo showing his Corona vaccination.
Uğur Şahin, the CEO and co-founder of the Mainz-based company Biontech, has shared a photo on social media showing him receiving a coronavirus vaccine. According to Şahin, the illness of a friend motivated him to get vaccinated.
There were false information on social media that I was not vaccinated. In fact, my wife and I received three doses of the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine, wrote Şahin on Friday in a post on the network "LinkedIn".
"My friends have been urging me to post a photo of me getting vaccinated for several months now, in order to counteract these false rumors." So far, he had rejected it because he believed that the communication should not revolve around him.
However, a call from last week had changed his opinion: "I was deeply disappointed when I found out that an old school friend of mine is currently fighting for his life. He is fighting against a severe Covid-19 infection and has been on a ventilator for three weeks."
The classmate and his family were not vaccinated, wrote Şahin further. He did not ask for reasons.
"It seems that the most common cause is fear, which is often fueled by incorrect information and mistrust." Fighting fear with facts is difficult, and sometimes it's better to share personal experiences.
There is an interview circulating on the internet with Deutsche Welle in which Uğur Şahin states that he is not vaccinated. However, the video was created in December 2020, as Deutsche Welle itself clarified.
"At that time, it was not legally allowed for me to get the vaccine myself," said Şahin. There was a prioritization in vaccination in Germany.
Now the prioritization has been lifted - and the Biontech CEO has stated that he has been vaccinated three times.
Fire in transformer station: Thousands of people without power in several towns in North Rhine-Westphalia on Friday evening the lights went out: no power anymore and in many cases also no heating.
A fire had paralyzed a substation. After a fire with severe damages in a substation, tens of thousands of people in the Rhein-Sieg-District in North Rhine-Westphalia had to be without power for about 24 hours.
On Friday evening, 41,000 residents in several towns had their lights go out due to a fire. Westnetz, the power supplier, reported that on Saturday many emergency generators were in operation until the large-scale outage was finally completely restored in the late evening.
Firefighters and helpers from the THW provided support in the communities. The authorities offered care places in schools and called for neighborhood help.
The supplier thanked the affected parties for their patience and the helpers for their effort. We are very aware that the past 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We would like to thank the affected communities, the district, the fire departments, and the THW for their tireless efforts," said Florian Witt, head of the Primary Technology Division, in a statement on Saturday evening. The repair of the damages will take several days, as the Westnetz technicians were only able to provisionally restore some connections at first, he explained.
A technical defect caused the fire, according to the company. Power is flowing again.
The fire that broke out on Friday at 7:15 pm, according to Westnetz's reports, severely damaged parts of the 10,000-volt switchgear at the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid substation. It is necessary to carry out extensive cleaning and repair work there.
In addition, a connection to a 30,000-volt voltage level has been created. With the help of this bypass, the power supply is restored.
Since Saturday 8 pm, over 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth would have had power again. Additionally, 20,000 residents of Neunkirchen-Seelscheid would have been gradually connected from 9:30 pm onwards.
Since 11:15 PM, the last customers affected by the outage also had power. Over 80 technicians from Westnetz and partner companies were in action.
The authorities had set up an emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday afternoon, they also called for neighborhood help. "It's important now that citizens take care of their neighbors, especially the elderly or those living alone, and report to the local fire department if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
During the installation and operation of emergency power generators, the focus was mainly on the residents of nursing homes. In addition, temporary care places were set up in schools for those people who could not take care of themselves or who needed medical equipment that was dependent on electricity or who required medical care.
Hello! Unfortunately, the roof in Germany is sold out.
Can I buy it from you and pay in Euros? It's the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# in blue-green.
I hope you also had a beautiful day and please stay healthy ❤️
I can't mount the underside on the table plate. It's custom #NAME#.
There are 3 variations. We wanted the one with a tabletop diameter of #NUMBER#.
We have a diameter of 155cm.
Today my #PRS_ORG# arrived, but I cannot combine it and therefore shorten it. Can you help me further?
If she was not suitable for the purpose, I would have to send her back. I would be happy to receive feedback.
Yes, that's really simpler! Then let's do it that way!
Could you please send me the return receipt via email?
The repair is now completed. I had already tried to do it before the chat.
Before making the purchase, I had not restarted the E-PRS_ORG#. Should I do it now?
I find such a low invoice almost unexpected. That means we are not in agreement.
Nordic Combination: Fabian Rießle Wins The German Nordic Combiners Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmid have podiumed at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to give up again to the outstanding Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already taken a large lead after the ski jumping and was now leading in the luge.
Return of Order Number #NUMBER# When will the money be transferred to my account?
Yes, we have both made a new version and are using version 4.5... It could be that they have already encountered problems with it.
I bought a book directly with my #PRS_ORG#, it seems to be on it too. As soon as I want to open it, the message comes up: oops!
This document cannot be opened. The file may be corrupted. Please report the issue to customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# ePub file. Can you help me further?
The chat connection is gone and now? I have to work in between!
To ensure even and clean color application, it is recommended to clean the building blocks with a little soap water to remove dust, grease, and fingerprints, then rinse with clear water and dry. Before using a new color on the model for the first time, it is advisable to practice with 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the unseen inner side of the parts or on a yogurt cup. The first stroke on the part
"Apply the paint evenly stroke by stroke. A slight overlap of the color layers will later result in an even surface."
Avoid quick back-and-forth wiping with a brush. This results in unrealistic-looking surfaces.
A model is not a garden fence. Start with the bright colors.
The dark ones could later become visible. Metallic tones and metallic colors come at the end with a separate brush.
If the metal stripes are mixed with normal colors, it can result in unpleasant appearances. Let the painted parts dry for a day before you varnish them.
The models achieve their original appearance through decals or transfer sheets. From national emblems on airplanes to ship names, automobile decorations, and identifying marks: Decals give the model its final touch.
Arrange the decals in the correct order while the parts are still easily accessible. It is easier to apply the cockpit of an aircraft before it is installed in the fuselage.
"More important than the right tools, such as scissors, tweezers and pliers, are patience, time and a steady hand when adhering. Cut each required decal individually and place them for you."
Decals are also known as water transfer images because you can moisten the back of the decal with water until the carrier paper becomes dark. Then you simply move the image a little bit off the paper and place it on the corresponding spot on the model (which you have also pre-moistened).
While you hold the decal on the model with a tool, pull the carrier paper to the side. Caution: Always check if the image is correct before completely peeling it off the paper, otherwise it may stick to your finger, knit or even tear.
"Excess water with a household sponge. Caution not suitable for children under 3 years old."
I can only open a book briefly as soon as I look at something else, then I can't read the book anymore and have to log out and log in again and reload the book and find my place again until I know where I left off. On Saturday, I had already communicated with you before.
Can I receive this via email? Also for all three packages?
"Because the lamp arrived in three individual packages at my place"
Thank you anyway! Then I'll go shopping somewhere else as soon as the money is back.

Hello everyone,  Kinderwunschbehandlung bei PKV / What is a "Versicherungsfall"?  In German, "Kinderwunschbehandlung bei PKV" translates to "Child Wish Treatment at PKV" and "Versicherungsfall" translates to "Insurance Case".
We were in children's wish treatment for some time, now that it's about billing with the PKV, it suddenly stands in the way. One by one:
We had requested the children's wish procedure from the PKV in advance and received approval for three attempts. The attempts were not limited in any way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt resulted in a successful pregnancy and birth and was covered by the health insurance. Some time later, we tried to have a second child and went through two unsuccessful attempts, which we did not yet deduct from the health insurance.
We requested the cost reimbursement from the PKV again and were granted 3 more attempts. After a few more attempts (we have conducted more attempts than agreed, logically the most expensive ones with the PKV), we submitted the invoices to the PKV and received the unpleasant surprise: instead of 5 attempts (2+3), the PKV will only reimburse 3 attempts.
The explanation: With pregnancy/birth, the other two attempts of the first acceptance fall. The second child wish is a new insurance case.
According to the AGB, "The insurance case begins with the treatment, it ends when there is no longer a need for treatment." The questions for the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here, the PKV (only 3 replacements will be refunded) or us (there are 5 replacements to be refunded)? * Shouldn't the PKV have informed us that with a birth the further replacements would expire?
Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case? Since infertility (caused by closed ovaries) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts could give their opinion here. Thank you very much for your help!
Could you please send me the three variations via email and let me know how I can best reach them?
In order. We will not order anything from them anymore.
If you add up my sales and those of my friend #NAME# (same address), it's clear that you've lost good customers. Please feel free to pass this on to your manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, my colleague told me that the repayment had been ordered and now you are telling me that I have to return the item first. I can't do anything about the fact that the couch is completely damaged when it arrives at my place.
Please check the screenshot to see what the colleague wrote. It is clearly visible that the repayment has been instructed and I have not yet received the repayment via #PRS_ORG#.
You can inform your manager that you have lost two regular customers. My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment through his account.
We will not do that anymore. No, the defect appeared after several months.
A desk chair must be able to withstand normal use. Otherwise, they cannot sell it as a desk chair.
The guarantee of 24 months is valid regardless of that.
No, it is not possible for me to obtain another type of packaging. I will dismantle the wardrobe and make it available to the transportation company.
Hello, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG# products. Are these products advertised with additional chairs that we unfortunately cannot find at your store?
Can you help?
The theme of the week: The best low budget films  What exactly defines a low budget film, there is no general definition with exact budget boundaries.
According to Wikipedia, a low-budget film or low-budget movie is a motion picture that was made with minimal funding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the internet, you can find plenty of lists of low-budget films, like for example on Letterboxd.com. Do you know any interesting representatives of this category?
What excites you about it? And what didn't you like about it at all?
I am a very good customer of yours, I have already completely furnished two homes with your furniture. I wanted to get the best price for the gray leather sofa Odelle.
The delivery time has been extended again, is it now reliable? Thank you.
"There is no phone number, a chat where you have to wait for 30 minutes, is no chat!"
Unfortunately, nothing changes at the waiting position...then I will give up again, because it simply doesn't work here. Hello
"Half victory" against Belarus with high costs for the EU connected The EU can, according to political expert Raphael Bossong, declare a "half victory" in the conflict with the Belarusian regime.
The costs would be very high and mean significant violations of the rights of migrants and refugees at the Belarus border with Poland and Lithuania, said Bossong to the Evangelical Press Service (epd). Sustainably, the EU has not resolved the confrontation, said the researcher of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Politics (SWP).
This hovering state - Belarus is not entirely small, but the EU feels itself as a winner - is likely to continue for a while. The treatment of people at the border is not in line with the European Human Rights Convention, ruled Bossong.
It seems that there is an increasing normalization of pushbacks by individual EU governments. Since the EU as a whole has not taken a stance against it, this is happening at the expense of fundamental rights.
This development weakens the cohesion in the Union at the same time. "She can obviously not impose her will when a member state puts its thing into its head", as is currently the case with Poland, which does not even allow Frontex, the EU border protection agency, access to its border.
In addition to the price the EU pays for its policy on the border with Belarus, as Bossong says, there will be a difficulty in establishing a fundamental agreement on asylum policy because the line "border protection, border protection, border protection" has been strengthened. Another attempt to cross the border.
According to the Polish Border Guard, migrants have again attempted to enter Polish territory through Belarus. A spokeswoman for the agency said on Sunday that 55 migrants had been arrested and returned to the border in the night.
The Polish officials were attacked by migrants with stones near the town of Czeremsza. According to reports, a soldier was hit in the face and had to be treated medically by a military doctor.
The Border Guard registered a total of 52 attempted border crossings in 24 hours. Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had managed to overcome the border barriers.
Thousands of people from countries like Iraq and Afghanistan have attempted to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months. The EU accuses Alexander Lukashenko, the leader of Minsk, of luring them with the prospect of entry into the EU.
According to press reports, Poland and Lithuania have closed border sections. The EU has imposed sanctions on Belarus and threatened airlines that bring migrants and refugees to the country.
Additionally, EU commissioners traveled to the countries of origin of the people to prevent them from leaving. The most effective element of the EU's reaction is the pressure on the airlines, said Bossong.
"The EU has shown its market power and proven its determination to act with tough sanctions and extraterritorial measures. Minsk must also consider the internal political costs."
The Belarusian society is probably not used to the fact that the security apparatus regularly detains thousands of people across the country.
Mercedes is protesting after the controversial Formula 1 finale that Max Verstappen allegedly broke two rules during the race.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial Formula-1 finale in Abu Dhabi, Mercedes has filed an appeal. The Silver Arrows suspect two rule violations in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest has been filed against Max Verstappen's alleged violation of the rules during the last safety car phase in the Red Bull car, where he was supposed to have overtaken illegally. A second appeal was also lodged against the race result at the end of the race.
According to Mercedes, the protocol was not followed properly. Hamilton overtook on the last round in Mercedes and won his first Formula-1 title.
The maneuver took place shortly after the end of a Safety-Car phase, during which the Dutch driver overtook the car in front of him.
I am testing it. I am talking to the bank and reporting back to you again.
Thank you for the support.
The entry is free for members: Europa-Park is hosting the SC-Freiburg Fantag, which is named after the Europa-Park Stadions of the Sport-Club Freiburg, and has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
According to the park, members and holders of season passes from the Breisgau Sport Club, as well as members of the fan community, were able to visit the Europa Park for free on this day. In addition, there were also vouchers for drinks and sausages.
The roller coasters shone through the red and white stripes on this day. Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white helium balloons created the perfect scenery, so the park said.
The cooperation between the Bundesliga team and the amusement park located in Rust, 40 kilometers north of Freiburg, has existed since the beginning of the 90s. It was shown once again at the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the Europa-Park how well the partnership fits.
"Seeing shining fans who are having fun together on the roller coaster confirms it," says Europa-Park owner Jürgen Mack.

To obtain an optimal viewing field, the eyepiece should be as close to the eye as possible. The specially designed aplanatisch-achromatisch lens system allows you to use the eyepiece practically without any registration and color errors even in the peripheral zone.
Frequently, magnification specifications are marked on lenses. However, these specifications apply only to exactly specified conditions, which are rarely consistent with actual usage conditions.
To optimally utilize your eyeglasses, we kindly request that you follow the instructions in the "Technical Data" table (refer to the user manual in the packaging). Light reflections may occur on the lens surfaces of all optical devices, including impact lenses.
By using an anti-reflective coating, these reflections are significantly reduced. When the optimal usage conditions are met - keeping the loupe close to the eye - reflections on the lens surfaces are less noticeable.

Women in Schönwolde are searching for Christmas trees from farmer Frank Diers at the Tannenverkauf.
Once, a man had to drive back home alone because he and his partner couldn't agree, so he plants 2000 trees every year for this reason.
During Christmas, the 56-year-old has experienced many curious situations. This makes the holiday season a little more fun, he says.
And what about the coupon? Otherwise, I'm leaving as a customer!
"Well, I received a defective delivery and now I've paid the full price for it. Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!"
We don't need to have discussions about which one is better, but there is a certain similarity between the two. Both consist of meat that is grilled on a rotating spit.
And both have their names. In German, an equivalent might be something like "The Spinner," which doesn't sound as nice.
Problems with fiber optics + Devolo DLan/Magic We have had a new fiber optic connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems setting up a stable WiFi network. Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which received and transmitted 50 Mbit without any issues, except for a few failures.
The new fiber optic connection sends 500 Mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and to the LAN module, which is connected to the FritzBox, these also come through. However, on the other LAN module, which is connected to the WiFi, the full 500 Mbit no longer comes through, but the further away I am from the module in the house, the less comes through (so use a power socket that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This leads to the fact that the internet with the new fiber optic connection is now slower on the first floor (~45 Mbit) than before. I also ordered a new Devolo Magic Set, which apparently uses new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLAN, but there were also similar large losses here. Could someone explain to me why so much internet speed is "lost" when using glass fiber through the power line?
And is LAN really the only solution? It would be extremely expensive to lay LAN cables in this house.
I am really frustrated as to why I created an extra account here. Therefore, I would be even more happy to receive an answer.
When it's time to change the checking account, whoever thought about it, now there's peace with the checking accounts, they see themselves deceived.
While many banks used the fall to confirm the fee increases of the past with various tricks on their customers, the interest-free periods for negative interest rates are also decreasing. For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of 100,000 euros.
She has now halved the interest rate and even quartered it for daily interest. In the first step, the limit was only reduced for customers of the Postbank corporate savings branch - to 50,000 euros for Giro and investment accounts and to 25,000 euros for daily interest accounts.
"However, these lower rebates now apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as a spokesperson confirmed on request. This applies not only to new contracts but also to new individual agreements with existing customers."
The Commerzbank had already fallen below a limit of 50,000 euros, which still applies, as is the case with ING Germany. The popular direct bank DKB has reduced interest-free amounts in two stages, first to 50,000 euros and now to 25,000 euros.
"Well, more than 100 banks have now received a contribution of 25,000 euros or less, including the Sparda-Bank Berlin. However, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centers, which have successfully sued against this regulation in the first instance at the Landgericht Berlin."
Currently, there are discussions in the banks about whether the institutions should possibly make provisions - in case the upper instances were to declare negative interest rates generally invalid and millions of bank customers had to be refunded.
The table delivered was for 8 people instead of the one for 6 people. The underneath is the one for 6 people.

For her, who made headlines in 2021 with the "Friends" reunion and the continuation of her series "The Morning Show," this success is primarily the result of a lot of discipline and hard work. A whole army of assistants, stylists, and trainers takes care of her appearance.
Anyway, Aniston, treat yourself to a chip today (yes, read correctly: a single chip from the jar). The fact that you still manage to attract the hearts of both female and male fans equally is actually a miracle.
Perhaps, because she simply has bad luck with good fortune - and is still searching for the great love. And the baby wish has been crossed off the list.
Before she was constantly asked when she would finally become a mother. That hurt her.
The people who asked me have no idea what's going on with me medically, why I can't. It was really hurtful.
One can only hope that success and fame bring happiness.
Unworthy end of a career: Kimi Raikkonen's departure from Formula 1 turned out to be even quieter than expected.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn removed his glove and wiped the sweat from his forehead. That's it.
After a driving error and a slight touch of the tires, Räikkönen had to retire his Alfa Romeo during the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix before completing half of the race distance. It was his 349th and final Grand Prix, as the "Iceman" ended his career in the motorsport royal class.
Minttu and their two children also traveled to the United Arab Emirates to say goodbye. Räikkönens greatest achievement was winning the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He won 21 Grand Prix races, started from the pole position 18 times and finished on the podium 103 times. dpa
Friedrich Nolte wins the 60th World Cup - Nolte wins in the two-man bobsleigh - Sports The mark of the Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Björndalen with 94 successes is the goal of the bobsleigh pilot.
"I calculated that I needed to win 19.5 races per season to make it to Cortina 2026, and after winning two races in two days in Winterberg, I managed to hold off Johannes Lochner's attack by 5 hundredths of a second, moving from third to first place," said the double Olympic champion from BSC Oberbärenburg.
Then he changed something in the material setting and ran a larger lead on Sunday with 0.30 seconds. With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Halle), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Halle) he overtook the British Brad Hall.
The third place went to the Austrian Benjamin Maier. "We took a bigger risk today and were rewarded," said Friedrich, who also achieved his 22nd consecutive win.
The Berchtesgadener Johannes Lochner, who was traveling to Stuttgart, came in fifth place this time after being in second place previously. Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Feilnbach, who was in fourth place in the first race, landed in eighth place this time.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, then I would do it that way too," said Lochner. Nolte wins with home victory - Podium for Jamanka.
At her home track, Laura Nolte won her third season's victory in the women's two-man bobsleigh on Sunday. On Saturday, she finished fourth in the monobob, but on Sunday, she raced to victory with Anschieberin Deborah Levi as part of the German triumph in the World Cup.
Mariama Jamanka, a two-time Olympic gold medalist from the BRC Thüringen team, finished in second place at the German championships with Germany's fastest sprinter, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen. She also earned her first podium finish of the season.
The Wiesbadenerin Kim Kalicki landed on third place with Leonie Fiebig. For me, it was super cool, the first podium place in the World Cup, I am super happy that Mariama takes me with her.
"I am very happy with the development. There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but the start times today were okay," said Burghardt and emphasized: "It's not just about pushing forward, but there's also a lot to do around it."
Jamanka was a bit annoyed with the slightly error-prone trips, but she thought: "It's going in the right direction."
I had the bedding in my shopping cart and could buy it now!!! What should I do?
I didn't receive it yet and therefore couldn't redeem it, that's why I finally asked. Due to Corona, I had other problems last year and never had time for it.
And now it was said that what had made me very angry had passed. Look in the chat, it was about the Asare chair.
I would like to return it and then reorder it since it is currently on sale :)
Why is the shipping starting on March 16th? There was no information about such a longer delivery time on your website.
No until I click on it, there will be an extra field with the message.
Yesterday, my colleague picked it up. Why is it a problem today?
I also sent you pictures of the incorrectly delivered goods.
However, we still want the shelf module, just a new undamaged one, and not to cancel the entire order.
Only this day, only this week, only until XY... Hello lovely girls and women,
I have some things that I just want to write and maybe it goes for one or the other... I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student, and dog mom - except for the fact that my dog doesn't bark or goes to kindergarten, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (we've been friends for 6 years) is sick, he got a second-degree burn on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy). Yesterday I visited him because I also had emotional needs and because I wanted to see and feel him, we hugged a lot and it was nice.
I helped him with his shower (because his hand is in a cast due to burns). He is also cold and we see each other less often (1-2 times a week) which makes it very difficult for me to meet my needs for affection and love.
My puppy has just stomach ache, I cooked for him and now he's lying in his blanket and has relaxed a bit after I was with the heating lamp and stroking him. I live alone with my sister and my mother, and she's gone away for a month.
"Now we also have to do housework, which we of course divide up. But even cooking is a lot of work for me..."
My PTBS (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) illness is now well-adjusted, I am halfway through treatment and am getting better. Not good, but I am getting better and am almost symptom-free.
My university is demanding a lot from me right now. Tomorrow at 3 pm I have a written test that I haven't prepared for yet, and tomorrow afternoon I have an Anatomy class that I should have at least some preparation for. And next week I have a oral exam scheduled, and everything else is in my calendar but not in my head because there's no room for it.
My week goes like this: Just until tomorrow, then it's weekend. But what happens after that?
Only until the birthday. Only until the start of vacation.
Only until the weekend. Only until...
And so it continues eternally. I believe, I am just so stressed that I need these spiritual anchors, otherwise I would drown.
"I feel guilty and chaotic somehow, but I don't know how to do it differently... Does it go the same way for you?"
Sincerely, I am infinitely grateful that I don't have to work. I can't express how infinitely grateful I am in words.
I don't know if I would have survived my captors if it weren't for the mental load of women. That's why I thought I would find fellow sufferers here...
I wish you all a relaxing evening, the week is almost done!
I received my order today unfortunately, the entire thing is a different color and the surface is scratched, and the table leg has an impression. The first delivery's color was exactly like on the website.
We are very disappointed!!! What can you offer me?
If we switch the table now, will I get a different color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on December 26th. Additionally, it was sent two other times.
"However, it was not confirmed."
"At that time, it was completely different: I noticed in school that many religion teachers did not believe in God and saw it as just another subject like math or geography. For me, that was always strange, maybe because I was raised in a Christian way and I always had some kind of belief."
How are you doing? Maybe you can tell me about your work or study colleagues with different attitudes.
Generally, I understand the difference between private and professional life and it makes sense to separate them. There are also lesson plans, etc.
"But it was simply strange to find a physics teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity. What brings one to want to teach religion when one does not believe in it?"
Culture or something? I hope the question is not too private.
Can it not be changed or not?Write often English, I understand it well too. This is already very long, then I would avoid it.
That's good, thank you. I expect a feedback soon, latest by the beginning of the next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.
Hello everyone,  I'm looking for a film. Can you help me, please?  Love,  [Your Name]
I am looking for a movie from my childhood (I am 24). I believe it was a movie for teenagers.
The film has two time axes (or parallel worlds). On the one hand, the modern era (real world).
To the other the past (or the realm of the dead) (not entirely certain). Since I cannot describe it any further in the real world, there is a young woman.
And in the land of the dead a young soldier (uniform similar to those of the soldiers from the Caribbean). For some reason, their paths cross and a story unfolds.
I believe the antagonist is also a soldier from the land of the dead who wants to bring the woman to this realm to be able to live himself. I think the transition is also the graveyard of the soldier.
At the end, I believe both soldiers are fighting against each other. If you have something to say, I am grateful for every answer.
Our little one has been sleeping on its stomach since week 1. Almost there :D
Relax. A child holds out much more than one thinks.
Make sure everything is in order, no cushion creatures sneak in and peek, but no minute surveillance. That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room. Good mattress.
"No cuddles. We didn't have a duvet, we always had a blanket."
Observe your child when it sleeps. Does it turn its head to the side?
Is it possible to lift something from the stomach, or is it directly in front of the face on the mattress?
You can tell if everything is in order by looking at it. We have also grown up and when my husband was born, it was common practice to put the kids on their stomachs to sleep.
Additionally, we are already "regular customers" with you and have already purchased many articles. But why are you only offering me 20EUR?
Hello, I wrote to you about my wardrobe that arrived yesterday (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC-ID#) and I haven't received any feedback yet.
The right drawer doesn't fit in the cabinet. Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not usable.
To make it clear. RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know myself that not everything can be held on to. And I had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that simple, the politics of this broadcaster is now underwater. Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then they still go on a big begging tour at the same time.
It was said that one was an "independent" internet broadcaster. Quote Arno: One would not want to be a "running column".
What is it now? An 0815 advertiser who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to elite fans.
And then we have Marah's Do's & Don'ts. These naturally apply to everyone except Simon and Etienne.
They can certainly continue to insult people. A landlord who completely lacks empathy tries to make up for his actions by renting out the exploded rooms and trying to cover the damage with ashes.
How should one find all of this? Great if you like it, I find it terrible.
I would like a callback, as the delivered wooden table was defective. Damage caused by careless delivery from #PRS_ORG#.
If you need comfort for stomach ache or just want to cuddle - my little warm friend is versatile. Kirschkern cushions are a traditional household remedy for warm applications, as Kirschkerns absorb and release heat very well.
The removable cushion can be easily warmed up in the microwave or in the oven. The soft connection makes the application particularly pleasant, so that the little ones feel safe, even when it doesn't go so well for them.
The cherry pit pillow with reference is only suitable for use as a heating cover in the following applications: before warming the pillow on unusual odors, stains or burns, check and immediately dispose of if present.
Please remove the inner cushion from the socket before heating it in the microwave. Heat it in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (follow the instructions of the microwave manufacturer!).
"Directly after heating, distribute the heat evenly in the pillow by shaking it. Then put the inner pillow back in its place."
During the initial heating, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, which disappears with repeated use. Always follow the specified heating instructions, as longer times or higher energy consumption can cause damage (fire and burning hazard!).
Before heating the cushion in the microwave, make sure that heating of core products is allowed according to the manufacturer's instructions. After heating the cushion, check the temperature of the cushion for suitability for babies (max. 43 °C) by placing it on your wrist.
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or feverish illnesses, circulatory problems, fresh hematomas, blood outflows and open wounds, as well as in people with reduced pain sensitivity. In case of existing skin, heart, vein, diabetes, tumor or pregnancy conditions, please consult a doctor before use.
If the seams were opened and the loose kernels came out, dispose of the product and the loose kernels immediately and inaccessible to children. If the product is used on babies under 1 year old, the temperature of the child during application should be regularly controlled to exclude overheating!
All incidents related to the product must be reported to the manufacturer and the responsible authority of the country where the user is located. The relationship is decreasing and can be washed at 30 degrees Celsius in the machine.
Please pay attention to the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Hinserie Zweiter - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf Darmstadt 98 can dream of returning to the Football-Bundesliga.
While Hannover 96 is working its way out of the relegation zone, things are also not going well for Ingolstadt under its third trainer.
Celebration in Darmstadt after the late victory in the top game, joy in Hannover over interim coach Christoph Dabrowski and frustration in Ingolstadt after the failed debut under the new coach Rüdiger Rehm.
Is the battery dead? My laptop (ThinkPad E480 20KQ, about 3 years old) couldn't be charged through the power supply last night.
I bought this about 5 months ago, it should still work. I thought that the power supply alone would be enough to operate it.
Error message, the battery is empty and the laptop won't start even with the charger plugged in. After removing the battery, nothing works either.
Do you have ideas? A new battery has been ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in online mode?
Is there anything else wrong? Thank you for your help!
I would like the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to my room. How can I do that?
I am interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair. However, I do not know how high the seat is.
Often on tour and still carrying a lot of equipment? No problem with the Everyday V2 Backpack from Peak Design!
A 20-liter storage capacity can easily accommodate larger photo equipment using the cushioned FlexFold foldable parts. And for all your everyday items, they remain well-organized and separable from the photo equipment thanks to the practical access points in the individually configurable interior space.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line to version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look. The sleek, minimalist design has it in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that reliably protect the interior of the backpack and at the same time provide quick access to photography equipment in seconds.
It works with two options: conventionally through the cover flap, which can be locked with the MagLatch closing system, or an excellent solution that has proven itself effective in protecting messenger bags. In the closure flap is a locking mechanism made of metal with corresponding anchors on the front of the backpack.
Peak Design has considered different "filling levels" compared to most backpacks. There are actually 4 anchor straps, securely connected, into which the closure buckle can be inserted. If the backpack is fully loaded, you simply take the upper strap if it's full, or a lower one if it's not.
The flap closure and hook are also magnetic. Therefore, the backpack can be reliably closed without attaching the hook.
The second option distinguishes the Everyday Backpack from other Fotorucksäcken in a fundamental way. In addition to the Deckelklappe, there is also a Reißverschlussöffnung on both sides of the rucksack. This eliminates the biggest disadvantage of traditional rucksacks with a top access - you no longer have to rummage through the contents!
This clever detail increases the everyday practicality of the backpack enormously: If you not only bring your photography equipment, but also everyday items or travel luggage. In the Everyday Backpack, you can configure the inner space individually (more about that below) and thus easily and separately store both - and through the two side openings also independently access them.
Additionally, you can pull the backpack from the right side towards your body to access the camera equipment in the right compartment, while everyday items remain secure in the left half of the backpack and do not get in the way. Comfortable, adjustable shoulder straps help with this.
And since the outer shell of the backpack is completely made from 100% recycled, weather-resistant nylon, the contents remain dry even when going to Scotland in the fall.
Unfortunately, I have been waiting in vain for an email from their support team. #NAME# sent me a confirmation email for the task assignment yesterday.
I have received no information yet about the pickup of the incorrectly delivered table by the expedition team.
I would like immediate termination. I have been writing to the third support employee, but none of them have been able to help me further than giving me a promise that I would receive a confirmation email.
The text is about the return of the incorrectly delivered Custom #NAME#.
It's clear to see when the wardrobe can be delivered again? For me, it's not an option to keep it like this.
It works. Thank you so much for your help.
I wish you another beautiful evening.
Hello, my order number is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered? The order and payment were on January 12, 2021.
I received a completely different lamp than what I ordered. Please call me.
If you extend the voucher, then I will immediately place a larger order, but at least I have kept the damaged piece of furniture and did not send it back. And that the past year went differently than expected, I could not know and did not have the opportunity to redeem it and clarify it in a timely manner.
"However, as a customer, I do not accept that kind of damage."
Rotinger brake pads are designed for the demands of the dynamic driver, who values reliability and safety during braking even under difficult conditions. Rotinger brake pads are cast and then mechanically processed (machined and cut).
All the guessed sheets are manufactured in short series according to individual technical properties that are specific to certain sheets and patterns. Based on the individual technical drawing, a special production program is created that focuses on the stretching of the sheet according to the properties of the original mounting.
The produced sheets in this way ensure high comfort and braking effectiveness. Additionally created openings increase the cooling effectiveness of the sheet, while the cuts improve the cleaning of the brake pads and rotors.
The aesthetic properties of our painted sheets highlight the character of each car through an attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event shaped the history of the West Coast. In winter 1848, a man discovered glowing rocks in the water at the southern tip of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news spread quickly and caused the so-called "California Gold Rush" of '49. Thousands came from near and far and made Coloma one of the fastest-growing and prosperous cities in the country.
Areas were marked off, tents were set up, and saloons and hotels sprang up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their share of the country's wealth.
For many it was: "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or bankruptcy)! In this game you are a pioneer who seeks wealth in the West and wants to make a name for yourself.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, drive horses together and build companies. You will also have the opportunity to explore the surrounding river flows and adjacent areas.
You are not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea! You have to outdo your pioneer colleagues in order to avoid going bankrupt with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast-paced strategy game with many paths to victory. You simultaneously choose your actions, must manage your resources, and build a tableau that works for you (known as "engine building").
The buildings on your tableau allow you to become more efficient, receive additional actions, or apply rules to your advantage. With these buildings and dynamic bridge tiles, you can develop your individual playing style through fine adjustments.
Coloma played over a period of three years, from 1848 (the year the gold was discovered in Coloma), through 1849 (the year of the California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year California became an official state). A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a location on the game board where they can perform actions. Then their choice is revealed and they place their pawns on the corresponding locations.
If a base has the most pioneers, it gets a wall! This deactivates half of the base, reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players take turns performing actions, such as winning resources, moving vehicles, setting up tents, searching rivers, building bridges, opening shops and positioning revolvermen. When all actions are completed, the pioneers return.
The bidder turns to a new location at the beginning of each round and changes the available actions. This continues until the bidder has moved five times, or has covered each location once, and the year ends.
There is a shootout, in which the players Coloma have to defend themselves against an attack by angry bandits. If the players have enough cowboys and outnumber the bandits, they receive rewards.
If they fail, they receive lower rewards or end up on the graveyard. The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player with the most victory points wins! For free shipping, I accept up to dimensions of 35 x 25 x 4.5 cm for the shipping method and game delivery.
"With all other items, it is usually DPD insured and comes with tracking (games included, wrapped in flies and paper). If you are a collector, I can send it in a box for an additional fee of 2 euros, which is 100% guaranteed to have no printing issues."
"Why Children Aren't Tyrants" Document, ARD Mediathek CW Psychological Violence, Sexual Abuse, Power Abuse
The ARD documentary has appeared in my Twitter timeline today, and I watched it immediately. >Michael Winterhoff, a child psychiatrist, is a popular guest in talk shows and gives lectures throughout Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become Tyrants" (2008) he caused a fierce debate on education. Former patients and educational authorities now raise serious accusations against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to endure. And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsible people should never, never, never seek power over the child. Our goal must always be to give the child space for their development and to create the largest possible framework for the child in the given situation.
"Shivers, I am still shaking."
Holetschek: Countries discuss the abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals The health ministers of the countries will decide on a federal-wide abolition of the test requirement for triple-vaccinated individuals in their next meeting.
"We countries need quick clarity on when the test requirement can be lifted for triple-vaccinated individuals," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), chairman of the health ministers' conference, in an interview with "Bild am Sonntag." The removal of 2G plus for triple-vaccinated individuals is "not only medically sound, but also provides an additional incentive for vaccination," said Holetschek.
According to the article in afp, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) has stated that he will present a proposal to the Health Ministers' Conference on the coming Tuesday.
"Also I want to send the lamp back. How do I go there best?"
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very beautiful, but I can't see how high the seat is. Can you help me further?
I can no longer process purchases through my #PRS_ORG#. Error message: Ups, an error has occurred.
I am purchasing through the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer. I have updated my account information.
What could this be referring to?
What you describe as *Awareness* is referred to as sensory perceptions under narcosis. These occur with a frequency of approximately 1 in 1000.
The most common occurrence is hearing noises/voices, less frequently seeing images, and almost never feeling pain. Relevant to this topic: Kaiserschnitte are operations that are associated with a higher rate of awareness, as in order to protect the child, a very deep anesthesia is avoided up to the point of separation.
The previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned during the pre-anesthesia consultation. Certain anesthesia techniques, such as total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), are associated with a slightly increased risk.
"Love everyone, this comment from me describes awareness correctly, but u/Nitemarex had none. I have read his comment incorrectly."
The chair is defective, unfortunately the 20€ doesn't help either.
These are legal warranty claims. The absolute minimum would be for them to return the defective stool.
This is not only a legal obligation but also a standard practice in the eCommerce industry. Please check again if you have at least returned the defective stool.
We are selling the second chair privately. That means we will lose some money.
I already sent you an email that you haven't replied to. Can you please answer my question again?
The order and invoice state that the goods will be delivered to a room of my choice. The courier is company #NAME#.
I just called there and they told me that they could only deliver it to the front door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so? If yes, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can carry the heavy furniture up to the first floor.
If I am not called? I had a question formulated.
Theater historian Günther Rühle, who was 97 years old, has passed away. He had established a profile as a theater critic and as an Intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental theater history. Günther Rühle died on Friday at the age of 97.
The new book is still lying on the table, fresh: "An old man will grow older". The shocking diary of a slow farewell from the world, which the theater historian and journalist Günther Rühle conducted until April 2021.
And in the middle of reading comes the news that the author is dead. The last sentence in the book reads: "I acknowledge my debt to life here once again."
There are various types of pallets. One of the most common are Europalettes, standardized wooden pallets that are widely used as load carriers in the European region.
You will be certified by the European Pallet Association EPAL in 2020. According to statistics from Austria, over ten million pallets were produced in Austria in 2020.
The production value was around 79 million euros. The number of pallets imported annually to Austria is not specified.

Rouladen Tips & Tricks I received many great tips last week for the perfect goulash.
There were so many delicious and buttery things to eat during Christmas! Thank you again :)
Now I have gotten a taste for it and want to cook Rouladen for New Year's Eve for the first time. Tomorrow I will set up a beef broth for it.
Do you have any other tips for me? Note: I have no oven, but only a large pot.
How is it going now? What is happening with the books, or how can I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't as good as it used to be, but I'll get there.
It's about a refund of €#NUMBER# I was already informed via email on 18.01 that the refund was successful.
However, the money is not in my account yet. Could you please check?
Where there is Christmas goose or duck in Lübeck, for many people it belongs to the Christmas days, like the Christmas tree and gifts.

We will reveal to you where you can still get a Christmas goose in Lübeck.
The "Drive" of a guitar amplifier plays a significant role in determining the warmth and fatness of its sound. This feature is perfectly executed by the Valve Reactor circuit.
With the VOLUME-, GAIN- and MASTER VOLUME-Regler, you can set the desired level and at the same time adjust the distortion. Additionally, the amplifiers of the VT+ series offer a unique POWER LEVEL-Regler, with which you can reduce the sound level without changing anything in the "Gain" and distortion.
The sound of the POWER LEVEL-Regler is already audible from above, indicating that it is possible to make a power reserve float with the POWER LEVEL-Regler when it is suddenly loud. Thanks to the POWER LEVEL-Regler, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be utilized in every situation.
The headphone jack can also be used as a line output. In fact, the signal being processed here is done so through a boxing simulation, so you can experience an "acoustic" sound impression when using headphones or making direct recordings.
The auxiliary socket can be connected to a CD player or MP3 player, so that you can jam to your favorite songs. A tuner function is also on board - you don't need a separate tuning device.
Who spends additional money on a VFS5 foot pedal can easily call up sounds with their feet, turn on/off effect blocks, and tap the tempo of compatible effects. This is actually essential for live use.
VOX is taking another step into the future with its new power packages!
"I had seen it differently at others. Is there a possibility for you to send the lamp back?"
Do you hang something too low over the dining table? Then I would like to send it back.
Can you help me further?
And the furniture? Do we get another update on the exact delivery date in the next few weeks?
Hello, have you sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs before?
If it doesn't work out, I would be satisfied with a bequest or voucher. In some cases, I might find a buyer for the furniture.
"Only over 1,000 Euros worth of goods that I don't need are still quite a bit."
I have just received my delivery and I would like to know if screws were part of the delivery. I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# Spiegel (door) on the designated hook.
This is not a satisfactory answer, and the waiting time has not been worth it. Do you have a premium customer status with you?
Iran sees progress in talks over nuclear agreement According to Iranian statements, progress is being made in the negotiations over the revival of the international nuclear agreement.
"Both sides are standing short of agreeing on the topics that are on the agenda," said Iran's chief negotiator Ali Bagheri on Sunday, according to the Iranian news agency Irna. This is a "positive and important development," he said, because at first there was not even agreement on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement aims to prevent Iran from building atomic weapons. The talks in Vienna were continued on Thursday after a nearly one-week break to revive the agreement.
Representatives from Iran, Germany, Britain, China, France, and Russia are participating in the negotiations. However, a US delegation is present in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thüringen has overtaken Sachsen as a federal state with the highest Corona incident rate. Currently, Thüringen has the highest incident rate in the country.
As the only state in Germany, the value is above 1000. As the only state in Germany, Thuringia had a Corona-Incidence above the mark of 1000 on Sunday.
The Robert Koch Institute reported a seven-day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants. In Sachsen, which had the highest incidence nationwide, this value was 990.5 on Sunday.
On Friday and Saturday, the incidence in Thuringia was slightly decreased, but still above 1000. In Thuringia, 2242 new infections with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 additional deaths related to an infection were reported within one day.
On Sunday, 200 severely ill Covid-19 patients were treated intensively in hospitals. There can be delays in reporting during weekends.
Additionally, the health departments have been overwhelmed for weeks and are struggling to keep up with the new cases.
I understand. Since the delivery starts in early March, it might be possible until then.
I have to print and attach it to the package and give it to the post office, is that right? Here do I need to click/point/fill in anything else?
I want to avoid exactly that, so I am writing to you. I kindly request that you take care of the return shipment at your own expense.
In my opinion, a 8 euro return fee is audacity.
It's time for changes. ###MBundestag seid mir gegrüßt, ich bin u/StratorDE im Plenarsaal im Herzen von Europa an einem fantastischen Tag!
What is the post here? Looking at the activity of the Bundestag in the past months, one can conclude that it does not exist.
We have entered a state of winter stagnation and have extended the summer gap for several months. #Where is the problem?
Yes, what has happened? Most likely it's just due to dissatisfaction, as some things have gone wrong here and we generally appear.
In recent days, it has become increasingly apparent that many people here still have a genuine interest in the German Bundestag. #What we need to change
"At this location, the community around the German Bundestag is asked which they want to keep alive. The initiative came from u/edizVEVO, who became aware of this project in the last few days and found, simply put, a pile of debris."
After some back-and-forth writing, several people from the community have been found who are interested in rebuilding the project. However, I would like to explicitly invite everyone to participate once again, only then can this project have a future existence.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a Discord server, where we can exchange ideas with each other and work on concrete things. You can join the server using this link.
Goals: * How should the German Bundestag function in the future?
* Which existing regulations need to be changed / adapted / removed? * How should we present ourselves externally in the future?
* How can new members be recruited? * How can we create a fair election system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten something, but it's not that bad, we'll figure it out at the end with Discord. If you have time and interest, come to Discord, work with us, and let's decide democratically about the future.
I ordered a lamp shade for you that is yet to be delivered, but now I see that the article is too big/bulky for that purpose and not suitable for my taste.
For that, I have already ordered a different suspension from you.
I put it together and noticed this then, when I took the soft foam. Very sad about it.
I hope that this will be returned to me and I will have a full refund. This is also quite sad because #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have one more question: does the Tagesdecke #PRS_ORG# also come in large sizes, like 240/240 for example?
The #PRS_ORG# must ensure that the faulty wardrobe is picked up promptly. Please arrange it now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, so I will disassemble the wardrobe as much as possible for pickup - they need to clarify with #PRS_ORG# how that works. #PRS_ORG# can always call me on the phone to arrange a pickup time.
Is there an instruction for assembly? How long would I have had time to take care of this or make a decision about sending it back?
How do you answer the question of why you are vegan? I had a conversation with a colleague I like today.
You yourself have lived vegetarian for a while, and now you probably rarely eat meat. I myself was a vegetarian for a few years before.
In response to the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan and if vegetarianism was a planned intermediate step, I answered honestly. And to be clear, I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would be supporting animal welfare. However, I eventually reflected and realized that in doing so, I would ultimately be supporting animal cruelty.
Therefore, my decision to become vegan. At that moment, I had the impression that there was resentment on their side, they defended vegetarianism and said they knew where their meat came from and as vegetarians, we reduce animal suffering.
Now I ask myself if my answer was too "fat"? How do you answer the question?
I feel like as a vegan, people often put me in a corner and conflicts arise without me intending it. It's nice to meet a vegan who loves harmony (;
This is not an exception under Section 312d of the German Civil Code. Your #PRS_ORG# does not release you from the legal requirements for remote sales.
I am at the assigned date, on which #PRS_ORG# picks up my retoures not on site. Since I cannot be on site due to a funeral, unfortunately it cannot be changed.
Could you please assign an alternative pickup time? From February 1st onwards, I will be available continuously.
The Lahnsteiner Wehr für Wasserrettung has been equipped with a 45,000 Euro grant from the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, which was recently presented to Oberbürgermeister Peter Labonte by rheinland-pfälzische Innenminister Roger Lewentz in the Lahnsteiner Rathaus.
The total cost of the vehicle that has been in use since November 2020 is 135,000 euros. A good and important investment in safety.
"I am happy that the state of Rheinland-Pfalz is supporting us here," says Peter Labonte, the mayor of Lahnstein. The equipment truck is used by the Lahnstein Diving Team, one of the seven units in Rheinland-Pfalz.
They fulfill tasks under and over water in water and ice rescue, as well as technical assistance. In Lahnstein, it is always expected that there will be an increase in missions: The boom in hotel shipping on the Rhine and Mosel, as well as the increasing use of the Lahn as a leisure river, contribute to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% of, and then the problems started. I can't open the book.
I followed their recommendations, however, I synchronized, removed, and reloaded the app, nothing worked. I'm a little frustrated because I spent a lot of time on the whole action and now I hope for help.
Okay, so. I would like to order 3 articles from the collection of #PRS_ORG# for June.
Is it possible to enter a date in the ordering process?

Thank you for being here, I have also spent almost a decade in public service in a similar task, we were also bearers of arms in the executive, further I do not want to go into it! The question of right and left I find always very simplified.
Generally, it should be said that a state employee is more likely to come from the liberal to conservative spectrum and not from the revolutionary left. This should be clear to everyone. It should also be clear that people who are attracted to uniforms and weapon bearers are more likely to be on the right side of the conservative spectrum. However, it is clear that these people may have difficulty dealing with reality, as there are now many Germans with migration backgrounds, women, and homosexuals (and I do not mean here the overly feminine gay stereotype, but rather normal men and women whom one does not notice when they do not tell anyone) and also on these people one must rely, because in doubt they save your life or set it for you.
However, even these fringe groups represent a conservative stance, although it may sound comical at first, according to my experience. They are proud of Germany and feel less alienated by overly left-wing politics, even though this politics may seem to be fighting for them or trying to do them justice, they simply want to be treated normally. Going back to the right, since the police and military are also a cross-section of society, we can find extreme right-wing views there too. However, this is medially exaggerated and bothers me, as they can openly express their opinions or even openly plot state-threatening plans there.
Naturally, it happens that police officers and soldiers, who have often been on foreign missions, often begin to generalize and even say things that are controversial or politically incorrect due to negative experiences. It also happens that like-minded individuals with a particular ideology meet and engage in intense intellectual exchange.
Nevertheless, this is well fought against and also with political education and enlightenment the whole thing is countered! Germany is so internationally entangled and that is also good in my opinion, that we cannot afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks!
Yes, what I don't understand, I also ordered the other basket on the German side. Why should this come from England?
When I placed my order, it was not sold out. I had already placed my order in November.
I received confirmation of your order in your response.
The issue is still with my order, which is no longer available. I had previously communicated with #NAME#.
Alternatively, could one deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euros in black to Germany or is this basket also available in Germany somewhere? I always find only you as a partner company.
However, on the edge of the wooden board are two deep grooves, which were filled with something yellow, and on the mirror itself is a small scratch.
"Are you ordering correctly? Hello, I have been dealing with something for a longer time."
I am very disciplined and organized at work (am self-employed, have very little free time), but even throughout my entire life, I have always found it harder to keep my household consistently clean and organized. There are always phases where everything just piles up, and then suddenly it hits me and I clean and organize everything.
However, it's actually never so "that someone could spontaneously come to visit." My husband (unfortunately) is also not better, it bothers me somewhere but most of the time he loses household chores simply because of work and lack of interest.
The kitchen is cleaned regularly so that we can cook comfortably. Now, to my question, have you managed to become more organized with your children?
We don't have anything yet, but we're working on it, and this question has been bothering me for a while. For me, there's no motivation, it just doesn't bother me that much, as long as no visitors come and, for example, there's always fresh clothing and the kitchen is usable.
Do you have more motivation when you have a child or do you remain lazy? I am looking forward to your answers.
An exclusive, new, and high-quality cut with anatomical shaping provides maximum comfort, a perfect fit, and enables nearly unrestricted movement freedom. Preformation with specific further shaping at the joints for improved movement freedom (on the arms and knees)
The Flex System 2 in the Focea Comfort 4 increased the area covered by the Flex System more than double to further improve comfort. Stretch panels without seams at the joints reduce friction (shoulders, elbows, and knees).
High-quality formations in the lower back region and in the step ensure a snug, perfect sitting position. The Elastin 8.8 Stretch-Panel in the lumbar spine area increases flexibility around the back seam and improves comfort, especially when bending and mounting and attaching equipment to the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is located around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in arm and back movements. Fireskin is a heating, water-repellent material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of heat protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat to a sensitive area of the body. A seamless, thin (-2 mm) sealing at the face on the helmet increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate helmet)
Soft, the zone in the collar improves the sealing with a fine adjustable width adjustment through a flexible, gentle adhesive closure, which does not adhere to the casing or the seams. Double-layered sleeves with a snap button connect an adjustable inner sleeve with a soft, cashed Neoprene outer sleeve to the arm and foot joints.
"45° inclination at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and load capacity during pulling. Long seam at the neck with an elastic reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort overall without a hood."
Long G-Lock P Backplate Retractable Closure (Without Helmet) with Metal Slider and Integrated Water Dam System for Improved Sealing (Beuchat Patent) Retractable Closures on Arms and Legs
Neoprene reinforcements at all ends of the seams, to prevent tearing if excessive force is applied. Neoprene panels tightly bonded with outer and inner overlapping.
The outer shells have reinforced edges for greater load capacity, and the inner shells have cutouts for increased flexibility.
The original Beuchat System was designed to fix the computer in its place, specifically for deeper diving (the system is compatible with all popular wrist computers).
Career in social work - with an uncertain personality disorder? I have completed an education in the field of software development and have been working for about a year now.
Unfortunately, I notice more and more that this profession is not the right one for me, which is why I have been considering for a long time to start anew and study social work. The problem: I have an insecure (or fear-avoiding) personality disorder (ÄVPS).
Roughly translated, it means that I don't have any self-esteem and therefore I'm shy. I don't have any problems talking to people on a factual level, but it's really hard for me to carry on casual conversations and I've been told many times that I come across as unapproachable (although I think I've improved on that).
Can I become a social worker? I don't want to work as a street worker or in an open youth center, but rather in areas such as addiction counseling or family support.
I know but I don't know if the concrete workday is really as it is in my mind, and it's hard to find something about it on the internet. The AEVPS is already causing problems (for me, emotionally) in my job because it always brings me down when there is something wrong with my code ("again, simple things are broken") and it's hard for me to ask for help from more experienced colleagues ("I should already know how to do this"/"I'm holding them back with my dumb questions"/"they must think I'm incompetent" etc.).
I would probably have problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it here.
Did you get the sofa back? Because there was no confirmation for it.
"I am waiting for a pickup time. Please let me know what they will bring back!"
If I download a book from #PRS_ORG#, will the message "Your #PRS_ORG# authorization for this book does not exist" appear if there are problems?
I was chatting with #PRS_ORG#, who asked me if I had received a delivery confirmation for my wardrobe.
The protein in the egg that the bird consumes is broken down in its stomach-intestinal tract into individual amino acids. These amino acids are then used to build up the bird's own proteins, which are also needed for feather growth. Feather growth in nestlings and feather renewal in molting birds are very complex processes and are highly demanding for the animal's overall system.
Please note that NEKTON-Bio should not be given during breeding, as it can cause disruptions in the hatching process. After this mandatory administration of NEKTON-Bio, it is recommended to switch back to the daily vitamin supply with NEKTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NEKTON-MSA (mineral preparation).

1 gram of NECTON-Bio in 250 milliliters of water or 100 grams of soft food. It is recommended to prepare only as much water/soft food as the bird consumes daily and to change the water/soft food daily.
A striped spoon (included) corresponds to 1 g NEKTON-Bio. In case of strong feather damage, at the beginning, the double or triple dose of NEKTON-Bio can be given until the onset of feather regeneration is visible.
After that, the normal dose is administered until the feather regrowth is complete. Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored dry and without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse me, but the chair will be sold as an office chair. How can an office chair break after 9 months?
The warranty claims in Germany are 24 months. That's really poor service.
Hello, I sent an email on Monday to inform you that my order was damaged and pictures were attached. Did you receive this email?
Statement of a community worker in opposition to the constitution Hello r/LegaladviceGerman.
I have the following problem. A walnut tree needs to be cut down on our property.
I have also submitted a request to the community. An employee writes to me that the cutting down of fruit trees, including walnuts, is not part of the statute.
However, the walnut is explicitly stated as a protected tree in the statute. Can I rely on the statement of the employee or not?
On one hand, I have to rely on an expert opinion. On the other hand, the statute is clear.
Thank you for your answers.
We understand. Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I haven't received any news, oh well, then I still have a sofa without any use.
Could you offer me an inheritance or a voucher? What was more expensive?
Yes, I believe that the question is whether I can pay in Euros and have the roof delivered to Germany. Can you check that?
Accident Report: A severe traffic accident occurred recently on St 2179 between the Selb-Nord exit and Plößberg on the highway.

Ah okay, I understand. Good, then thank you again that it was so simple!
Advice and ideas for further professional life. Happy Christmas for the first time!
My Christmas is unfortunately mediocre because my favorite head always ruins everything that can be ruined. Before I go on here ... in short: I need advice and the best from people who somehow know my situation - from you.
I am currently doing the Ref as a beginner. Originally, I studied something else and also worked in that area (at least to remain somewhat anonymous, I won't say anything more specific here).
The whole thing was then too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could give me more fun. Eventually, I landed in teaching and was sure that's it - even though the framework conditions were clearly less flexible than in my previous profession, but that was okay with me.
I am now on my third "I am searching for other job descriptions" and it has only been half a year.
While painting, I have always decided to continue and at least finish the reference, after that I can always change my mind. But now I am absolutely finished.
I had so little free time last month that I was completely exhausted. Now there are holidays, but there's still a pile of work waiting for me.
Before the weekend, I always thought I was stress resistant, but my weekend and my evening shift were my weekend and my evening shift. There I had free time.
And the stress at work was equal in those moments. Now, I find the family celebration to be too stressful.
And then there are these rigid structures that make me even more nervous. Generally, it's fun and from the outside it looks like the Ref is running well, considering the feedback and so on.
But I am completely drained and I ask myself, how much stress can my body withstand before it completely collapses - if it doesn't do that already. I ask myself, do I want to have the rest of my working life like this - especially when I read some of your contributions here -, or should I go back to the old area, where I was valued, I could take free time when I needed it, and the work, although it was somehow boring, was still appropriately paid and together with a team we achieved something and not as a lone fighter like it is now most of the time.
But then I ask myself, if I will be in the same place a year from now and still be unhappy. You see, everything is somehow confusing, but maybe you as an outsider have some advice or ideas on how I can get out of this situation, where I am completely finished and start to cry over the smallest thought.
I won't make decisions right now that are too emotional, that's probably not good. But maybe your opinions can help me see a little light at the end of the tunnel - or at least enjoy Christmas, which is enough for now.
Thank you for reading and I apologize for the melancholic undertone of my previous message. I hope my situation has become a little clearer.
Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" circuit, which perfectly reproduces the behavior of a vacuum tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we present a new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound.
Thanks to VET-Technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of parts and circuits, the VTX-Amplifiers are waiting with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also contain the multi-stage Valvetronix vacuum tube amplifier.
This relies partially on real analog circuits because these can better capture the sound variations and nuances of a vacuum tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, VTX amplifiers offer a sealed enclosure and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only sputter.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can correct and exaggerate historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound exactly like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is mainly due to the introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor-Technology in 2001.
Understandably, it has been further refined several times since then to meet the new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix Series in 2010 - with more dynamics and significantly improved amplifier models. From the handheld VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix-Series has been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for a maximum sound variety will find it here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: They expect a thick sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as a quick response. During an incoming analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that especially the output stage determines the tube amplifier character and developed the VOX Valve Reactor-Technology based on this finding.
The valve reactor circuit of a VT+- amplifier, which is equipped with a 12AX7 vacuum tube, perfectly captures the subtle nuances and sound character of a vacuum tube amplifier.
NBA: Despite 20 points from Wagner, Magic lose to Clippers, the losing streak of the Orlando Magic in the NBA continues.
The Wagner brothers can shine - but it's not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers. Despite 20 points from Franz Wagner and seven rebounds from his older brother Moritz, the Magic lost 104-106 to the Clippers on Saturday.
The main subject is also adaptable: with three individually adjustable and foldable clamping parts, it adjusts completely to the needs of your photography equipment and is therefore suitable for any type of camera - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras. Of course, what finally fits in the backpack depends on the size of the camera and the lenses.
A possible setup would be a DSLR camera with a fixed lens, two to three interchangeable lenses and a flash attachment. Larger DSLM cameras like the various models of the Sony a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 allow for more room for additional lenses.
Additionally, you can also store a lot of accessories. And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for their equipment and photo accessories.
Both drone pilots and everyday backpack users find the Everyday Backpack 20L to be an optimal choice because it provides ample space for a DJI Mavic Pro, remote control, and accessories.
Volcanic eruption on La Palma: possibly the longest in history In the past three months since the beginning of the eruption, the lava flows on the Canary Island have caused significant damage.
Is there an end in sight? With a duration of now 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been going on since Sunday, making it the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Island.
Until now, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585, which lasted 84 days, is considered the longest on the Atlantic island off the west coast of Africa. There are no reliable data on earlier eruptions.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in Cumbre Vieja has decreased slightly in the past few days, but volcanologists were still hesitant to make a prediction on when it would end. The indicators suggest a slowdown.
"The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Canary Islands Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, to the state TV channel RTVE. Millions in damage.
In the past three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000 degree hot lava has almost destroyed 2900 houses and other buildings, as reported by RTVE. Almost 1200 hectares were covered by a meter-thick layer of lava.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields. More than 7000 residents had to be evacuated, and the damages are estimated to be more than 900 million Euros.
Two new landmasses have formed along the coast due to cooled lava, with a combined area of approximately 50 hectares. The banana plantation, which is of immense importance to the island and supports about 85,000 residents, was heavily affected. The plantation was already in crisis before the volcanic eruption.
The newspaper "El País" reported that 225 hectares of banana plantations were destroyed and other areas were severely affected.
Christmas and gifts Christmas is just around the corner and children especially can hardly wait for the heavenly festival.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the crackling tension, something seductive about it. Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that still bring our increasingly divided society together.
It is so important to be conscious of the Christmas tradition of giving, so that the act of giving, which Marcel Mauss, a French sociologist and ethnologist, considered a peace-making "social contract between savage peoples," can break free from rigid routine and be filled with life in the context of this tradition. Like Saint Nicholas, who became the Christ Child.
Strictly speaking, it was the Protestants who linked the Christmas days closely with giving gifts. Before, on St. Nicholas's Day, gifts were given in various ways.
The background of this popular tradition is that Saint Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, is said to have thrown gold into the windows of three women in one night in order to spare them a life of sin. From this unconventional method of giving gifts, the custom of filling children's shoes with presents in Germany arose.
Protestants object to this practice because they reject the role of intermediaries between God and humans, which they consider to be "worship of saints." For this reason, they refuse to support the institution.
Martin Luther transformed Saint Nicholas into the Christ Child and established a new tradition line. As a result, the focus of gift-giving shifted to Christmas.
Since most Protestants no longer view such details as closely, only a few are still angry that the custom of Saint Nicholas, similar to the Martin's singing and Martin's parade, is still a firmly established part of the Christmas season. Today, one can find everything from socks to luxury watches under the Christmas tree that the heart desires.
There is a tradition of giving since the 13th century in Christian countries, which is documented by various sources on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the Reformation, the day of giving was shifted to Christmas Eve. However, in all Christian countries, there is a joyful hustle and bustle over the question of who brings the presents to the children.
In Germany, it depends on the region whether Christkind appears on Christmas Eve or the Weihnachtsmann, who is essentially a type of Nikolaus, appears with certain characteristics over time. For example, his white beard, which has little in common with the strict Assyrian beard of the historical figure, his sleigh, which is pulled by reindeer, and his preference for the hearth to gain access to houses.
In the Netherlands, Saint Nicholas is the central figure during Christmas. In Spain, the Three Wise Men give gifts, while in Italy, it is the witch Befana who is said to have shown them the way to the baby Jesus.
In Scandinavia sometimes mythical creatures bring gifts, while in Russia it was Father Frost who gained some fame. Here it's not reindeer, but three horses that pull his sleigh as a troika.
In Czechia, the homeland of the Reformation during the Hussite Wars, Christkind is responsible for delivering gifts.

Police shoot suspected bank robber near King's Palace Near the Kensington Palace in London, a armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that a man had been called in who had allegedly entered a bank with a weapon and robbed a bookkeeper's office. The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle that was later stopped by officers.
There were shots fired and the man was hit. He was declared dead at the scene of the crime.
The police were not acting from a terrorist background. There are several embassies located in the area around Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine, and their three children. Other members of the royal family also live there.
Which one? No matter where I click, I would immediately be redirected to your side.
The decorative light fits harmoniously into every flower bed, garden area or rock garden. The light is simply set up and can be securely anchored in the ground with two earth spikes.
Integrated and powerful 0.4 watt solar module for optimal charging of the built-in battery. Maximum light duration of 10 hours.
- The robust plastic production is suitable for use all year round in the outdoor area. In Hollywood spectacles, it is usually threatening objects from distant galaxies that glow internally with color.
On the other hand, "Smart Stone" is completely harmless: The sun alone is responsible for making these solar lights shine brilliantly - either in white or colored light (in six different color tones). The smooth, amorphous design is deliberately chosen: Like a naturally formed large pebble, this modern light object presents itself at day.
His organic shapes fit in every natural environment - whether on the edge of the terrace, in the lawn or in the stone bed. He also does well in the neighborhood of larger pebbles and boulders, where he can assert himself thanks to his size.
Large preparations you can save: As a solar light, Smart Stone does not require wiring or batteries. Place the Smart Stone on any sunlit spot.
Two anchors, which are delivered, ensure a firm hold when needed. The robust and weatherproof plastic shell itself is durable.
His solar module hides a "Smart Stone" discreetly inside, along with his battery and two LEDs - one for white light and the other for colored light. The battery charges as soon as sunlight falls on the case.
As dusk falls, the "Smart Stone" begins to light up automatically; you can choose the color yourself: six attractive light colors are available to you, in addition to daylight white. The shutdown is also done automatically, either when the battery charge level reaches a predetermined minimum or when it gets too bright.
As soon as the sun shines again, the charging cycle starts anew on the next day.
I have done it multiple times, but it didn't work.
I'm sorry, I would have liked to order more from you, but if the coupon is not credited, then I won't order anymore. If you think differently, please let me know.
Otherwise, today was the last contact. Then please send me the number for the sideboard.

I hope I'm doing everything right here, it's actually my first post on Reddit after a year. My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had such terrible pains during my period and terrible PMS before my period.
"Now I would like to stay here again, because due to chronic illnesses, I have to take medications that I cannot choose. My main problem, surprisingly, is not the pain, but my skin."
I had suddenly received 100 explosive-like pricks all over my body during my last two-year break. Although it was superficial, it really weighed me down and I didn't feel good about it.
The past two years have been in a state of pause and nothing has really normalized. Maybe someone has some tips to prevent this from happening again.
My cosmetics are already fragrance-free and without dyes, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend to me. Unfortunately, the female doctor didn't take me seriously and my dermatologist appointment is still coming up.
Thank you very much to everyone who has read the novel! Yes, love skin is such a thing.
I had severe neurodermatitis as a child, then I took a break, then I had widespread eczema and the acne theme. I also tried all possible diets due to my Christian illness, and I ended up being on a mixture of sugar, milk, and meat-free diet because nothing else seemed to work properly.
It can also be good that Hormonell is just a worm in there, but when you're like me and have construction sites everywhere, you'd rather stop looking for anything else that might go wrong.
I had already written everything for my colleague's seminar or similar, and now I have lost the conversation and don't know what was answered to my request.
I had to work in between and answer the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What is there to check if the money was there, I would have seen it? Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
However, he is generally available in large quantities since he is available in black in large quantities.

In the name of the people: laypeople render judgments while sitting in the courtroom in everyday clothing on the judge's bench.
However, much depends on their judgment, even if they do not wear robes: Judges, along with professional judges, determine whether and for how long someone is sentenced to prison. Two of them are reporting in conversation with the "Public" about their time at the Bad Kreuznacher Landgericht: Sascha Wickert from Boos and Ruth Ertz from Bad Kreuznach are two of the 125 lay judges at the Landgericht on John F. Kennedy Street.
Hello, unfortunately I cannot access the customer account. Could you please send me the invoice again from the order number #NUMBER# to the above-mentioned email address?
Can we dispose of the packaging material? We don't have any possibilities to keep it for such a long time.
We would use the table as if it were ours, as if it were ours.
I would be happy to help you translate the text from German to English. However, I need the text to be able to provide an accurate translation. Could you please provide the text you would like me to translate?
Does the wardrobe have to be completely disassembled for pickup and replacement, and when would the pickup be?
The 110-kV power cable will be built in 2022. The approval for the laying of the new high-voltage cable in Tann is legally binding.
The government of Lower Bavaria has passed a resolution for the planning of the construction, which is scheduled to begin in 2022. This was announced by the network operator Bayernwerk now.
The seven kilometer long cable will connect the substation Tann in the north of the community and the existing 110-kilovolt power line between Simbach and Pfarrkirchen. The cable will be connected to a mast of the overhead power line near the village of Edermanning in Reut.
Good morning, my order from 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has only arrived in part at our location so far.
The blue order number #PRS_ORG# with the delivery number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "Delivery not possible". All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the further process is now? Have a great start to the week!
You can forget that, I had already explained it several times yesterday!! This is a glass vase and the entire surface is cracked, so there is glass everywhere and the cardboard is broken.
The wardrobe is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to enter the apartment due to #PRS_ORG# regulations. This means that the wardrobe cannot be picked up because no one is allowed to enter my apartment.
Thank you for the message, but why only 20 EUR?
The initial value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR.
No, it is with all books, that's why the request is at #PRS_ORG#, because it is probably a general problem.
Hello dear colleagues,  I am writing to plan a lesson (EK).
I have been in the Ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I currently have big problems being time-efficient in planning my geography lessons. Unfortunately, my school is not well equipped technologically, so I can basically only use the board, textbook, and OHP as my medium.
At school, I can only copy s/w for free (which annoys me for geography). I currently need to spend a lot of time planning my hours.
We are currently working on the topic of Geofactors, and for me, every hour is crucial. In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time in simple teaching sessions (which I also need for UBs, etc.).
I usually start planning from the learning goal (what do I want to achieve) and then think about how I can build it up (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that my school doesn't have). We have the book Terra and I am not very satisfied with most of the tasks in the book.
Therefore also the worksheets. Perhaps I can work with a geography teacher who is time-efficient with the book.
I would really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the order #NUMBER#. I actually decided on a new one at #PRS_ORG#, however, I would like to process the return as quickly as possible.
The trade is worried about the 2G regulation for the Christmas business. Only those who are vaccinated or cured are allowed to enter most shops.
The trade considers it unnecessary and complains about sales declines. A possible solution, it has also prepared.
The 2G regulations are damaging the important Christmas business for the German Trade Association (HDE) from the perspective of the trade. In stores selling non-essential goods, there are sales declines to be complained about, criticized HDE managing director Stefan Genth.
According to a recent survey by the HDE among 1100 retailers, more than 70% of companies viewed the remaining days of the year negatively. Many had already written off their Christmas business.
"What was supposed to be the positive peak of the year is now often a bottomless pit," said Genth. Dealers with 2G access restrictions lost nearly a third of their pre-crisis funds in the past week.
Things are going well only in the single-ingredient food trade and in the online sector. The association demanded consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with a mask, distance, and hygiene concept is a safe affair, said the managing director. "2G shopping doesn't help us in the fight against the pandemic," he emphasized.
The current regulations scared off customers and required a high personnel input. He urged that the bandage regulation must be accepted nationwide, he said.
After that, each customer should only be checked once on 2G (vaccinated or cured) and would have access to all stores with the received card on that day. In addition, as already in the public transportation with the 3G rule (vaccinated, cured or tested), random spot checks should be sufficient in individual trade.
Deutsche Euroshop, a real estate company specializing in shopping centers, also reported a difficult Christmas business. The frequencies were recently at around 75% of the pre-Corona level without 2G, and the sales were at around 90% of the pre-Corona level.
"These numbers will now surely fall in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Wilhelm Wellner, CEO of the "Wirtschaftswoche". Due to the high personal and administrative effort, solutions will be sought and approved for the centers.
This includes the so-called wristband solution, where "visitors, for example, present their 2G proof at a central location in the center and then, equipped with a wristband similar to that in a club hotel, they can enter all shops without interruption." dpa
I recently ordered and received the #PRS_ORG#. The Spiegel has a scratch and there is also a mistake on the frame that was tried to be covered up with yellow putty.
That looks ugly. I would like to give the mirror back and have already put it back in the package and sealed it.
How should I proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD-LEDs with high power and high color reproduction. For adjusting the color temperature and brightness of the lamp, a modern microprocessor with exceptional capabilities is used.
Besides the adjustment of brightness, there are two standard color temperatures: daylight and artificial light. It is also possible to manually set the color temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K and save it.
Use the current settings in the flash memory. A special feature of the controller is that it is simple and intuitive to operate.
The light produces a very bright stream of soft light of high quality, completely flicker-free. The emission angle of 120 degrees, with which you can illuminate large areas at a relatively small distance, is excellent.
Incidentally, in reporter situations in small rooms or short distances, you can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
This is a great tool to work with either on the film set or in the studio. The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of lights in television studios or when the lights are mounted in hard-to-reach locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, consisting of buttons and a glowing display. The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current color temperature in Kelvin.
The slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery) is still located there. The user memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and color temperature.
To save the settings of individual settings on storage locations, simply press and hold one of the storage buttons for a longer period. The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when it is turned off, so that when it is turned on again, the known situation is restored - very practical in studio work when, for example, the camera is set to specific color temperatures.
Working with a battery is one of the greatest strengths of DL3120 functionality because it allows for operation with favorable NP-F batteries. These are often already owned by photographers and camera operators (and women) - so you can rely on existing equipment.
The DL3120 can check if the batteries have enough power before setting - it has a built-in battery tester - for each of the two battery compartments, there is a value displayed in the two display windows (the left battery upper display, the right on the lower display). Additionally, of course, it is possible to continuously supply the projector with power from the included power supply.
The construction of the flash is very simple. You have a 16mm housing for attachment, so you can directly connect it to your photographic stand.
The inclination can be reliably determined by measuring it on both sides. It was ensured that the mechanical components were of extremely high quality and therefore designed for durability and harsh use.
Additionally, there is a swivel mechanism included in the delivery range. It is also remarkable that there is a bag included in the delivery range.
This means that you can transport or store all the accessories that you may want to buy along with the lights without any problems.
I'm sorry, I received a gift that was too small :(
"The party we wanted to throw": Frankfurt celebrates after a successful comeback against Leverkusen. What a spectacular reaction from Eintracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the Hessen team, who had lost their last two games in a row, were supposed to be on their way to the next Bundesliga crisis. But then the SGE turned on, pushed themselves out of their frustration over a lackluster season start in just an hour, and won fiercely with a score of 5:2. "It's crazy what these kids did today," trainer Oliver Glasner exclaimed on DAZN and gave a "general praise" to everyone who was there.
During the game, at first it looked like there was going to be another dampener for the Frankfurt team, which was still nine points behind their expectations, with Patrik Schick leading Leverkusen 2-0.
What then happened also impressed the SGE trainer. "How the players then returned and showed a fantastic performance," said Glasner further.
I am absolutely crazy happy with the performance we showed and of course also with the result. Even defender Christopher Lenz, who was able to play again for the first time since the fourth game day and after overcoming his muscle injury, emphasized the morale of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is unbelievably large," said the 27-year-old and was pleased with a look at the result, especially for the audience. That was the party we wanted to laugh today.
For the upcoming tasks, Glasner now wants to keep the focus on himself, as he feels well prepared in terms of the personnel situation. It is remarkable that we have all players fit in December, that all players are physically in top condition.
The work in our medical department is top-notch, but the players also live professionally. Now we want to "take it step by step and remain humble" and complete the tasks until the end of the year at this level.
Next, there is an away game scheduled for Borussia Mönchengladbach on Wednesday as part of the English week (18.30, Sky) on the schedule.
I am getting an email that my package, due to an error on my part, is being returned to you. I tried to call #PRS_ORG# and transfer the call, but there was no chance.
Can it be sent directly to me again or do I have to wait until the money is transferred back and the order is reissued? If that were the case, it would unfortunately mean that I wouldn't be able to order again because it has already taken too long.
Have you ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chair?
Dampers for the German women's handball team against Spain in the quarterfinals after the defeat against Denmark with hanging heads and empty gazes from the bench.
At the end of the World Cup group stage, the DHB team lost 16:32 (8:13) to Spain in front of 800 spectators in Granollers. As a result, they will now face the host team Spain in the quarterfinals. "We were too anxious and had too much respect for the opponent," said national coach Henk Groener.
We need to act differently against Spain. After the first loss in the tournament, Germany finished the main round group III with 8:2 points in second place behind the Danish (10:0).
"It's a shame we couldn't take the flow with us. That was a bad game we had to delete," said Captain Emily Bölk.
In order to advance to the semifinals, Germany must significantly improve its performance against the second-place finisher from the 2019 World Cup on Tuesday. The delicate dream of winning the first medal since 2007 will be kept alive by the best German javelin thrower, Alina Grijseels, who scored six points in a duel with the three-time Olympic gold medalist from Denmark.
"We were simply not there - neither in attack, nor in defense," defender Xenia Smits admitted and demanded: "Now we have to quickly look forward." From front to back, not at eye level.
In contrast to the previous five tournaments, the German team was not up to par from the start. Misses and technical errors in the attack, as well as gaps in the defense, were responsible for a quick 0:4 deficit after seven minutes.
Dinah Eckerle, a peat cutter, was immediately on temperature and prevented a disaster with a few tricks. The first goal was scored by the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijseels successfully executed a quick counterattack.
The expected initial ignition was not this, however. Against the aggressive coverage of the Danish women, the German women could hardly get into the game - and when they did, they mostly failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the goal of the Scandinavian women.
The game was over at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially since backup player Mia Zschocke received a red card shortly after due to a hard foul against her opponent. However, she will be able to participate again in the quarterfinals.
The DHB team started playing better in the final phase of the first half, getting within five points of the lead by the break. However, there was only faint hope of a comeback after the switch, as it was already seven minutes into the second half at 9:19.
The Greens apologized again in all areas and made it easy for their well-prepared opponent, who was a medal candidate in the final round, to win. As a result, the German team could not achieve a performance improvement and left the podium as a clear loser.
DACH-Advent Calendar Day 6: Family Traditions During Christmas Time As part of the Reddit Advent Calendar, we have learned about Nikolaustag and use it as an opportunity to focus on family traditions during the Christmas season, including Advent, Nikolaus, Christmas Eve, and Christmas Day.
How was it at your home back then? How was it with your partner?
Do you want to pass on your traditions to your children? What is the best thing for children?
The translation for "Das Stiefelputzen? Plätzchenbacken?" from German to English is "Boot polishing? Cookie baking?"
Do you want to decorate the trees? Is there music being played?
When the Christmas man or the Christ child comes, or is the gift really from grandma and grandpa? It doesn't matter how you do it, everyone puts in effort to make Christmas as beautiful as possible as a family.
Whether there are firm traditions or something different every year: tell us how it went or goes in your family!
Could you please provide me with a transaction number or anything else that could help with the confirmation of the transfer?
I would like to generate a gift voucher code in the same way as #PRS_ORG#.
How is it going with them?
The title suggests that I am an impunity doctor working in mobile impunity teams, where (so far) only the BioNTech/Pfizer impunity vaccine is administered, mainly in nursing homes. Since these are almost finished, it goes on to impunity centers for me further.
I like to answer questions about organizational and human aspects, as well as medical questions, as long as they are not personally related (e.g. "I take medication X, how does that relate to the vaccination..."). In my job responsibilities, I focus on educating people about vaccinations, determining eligibility (the person has a right to vaccination under the Coronavirus Vaccination Ordinance and no reasons against it), documenting medical information, and providing emergency care in case of allergic reactions (this has never happened to me).
The administration of the vaccination itself is delegatable to qualified personnel, such as medical assistants. In vaccination teams, however, we often do not have anyone there, but only pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of vaccines, who cannot administer vaccinations themselves (can they?), so that I have to administer most of the vaccinations myself there.
Heavy "Butcher"-Question: Amberger knows the solution, What is a "Butcher"?
With this dialect word, sent from Amberg, there was cause for concern in the BR-TV show "We in Bavaria". However, unlike on many previous days, the concept remained unrecognized by the callers this time.
No, there was no "nervous person" and no one who "had to go fast".
The people heard from the TV moderator was completely wrong. What the man from Amberg revealed and thus probably also caused astonishment among many people in Upper Palatinate.
"The Sweeper", viewers learned, "is a rag with which someone wipes the oven." Dialect researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed by Bayerischen Fernsehen for years as an expert, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical concept from Upper Palatinate, derived somehow from the more well-known Mundart word "Houdern." What closed the education gap - well, also for many who have been living in the Amberg area for a long time.
I have been unable to buy books for two weeks. After confirmation, I always get the following error message: oops - something went wrong - try again later.
I have started the #PRS_ORG# gel#PRS_ORG#n, connected it to the PC, synchronized and repaired it. Nothing helped.
Tire selection for a racing bike - really that secure? I woke up full of action this morning because I wanted to do at least a little training for the preparation of my bike tour next week.
Said, done, and I rode my bike, which I bought on eBay yesterday. The first 40km were really nice - but then what happens in every city (this time: Thank you Krefeld!) occurred.
Glassblower on the road. Zack, loud clinking and my back tire wanted to join the rest of the road no longer.
Since I couldn't find a replacement jacket and hose on account of the day of the week, I had to turn back with a bad mood and take the first road home. It wasn't so bad weather-wise, maybe it's better if I practice with the tire change before the bike tour.
Now I stand before a question and hope that you can help me. Since I have a relatively long distance to cover over several days, I would not like to encounter this problem often.
"It's not that bad now, since the old tires from the previous owner (such a nice old man, he was there when I picked up the bike at 14:00 and had ridden 120km on them!) and he considered them suboptimal because he had been riding them for several years. But when I think about having to change a tire after 80-90km, I'm really not in a good mood :D"
I am now talking to an older man at the train station who asked me why I didn't have Marathon Plus tires; they are supposed to be unbreakable. Now it all sounds very tempting.
But are they really so durable? I have little enthusiasm now to spend 40€ per tire, only to be disappointed.
I continue to ask myself: I believe I have 25x622 on my bike at the moment. Although it is also available (apparently?) with Marathon Plus tires, the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem? Or would you give me general advice on changing the tire of a bicycle to another type of tire?
The Swallow Page seems to me to be more reliable! Would you rather recommend Durano DD? Thank you in advance for your help and love greetings!

Hello everyone, finally we can announce that we will be hosting the OSCAST again this year!
Unfortunately, it is not possible for us to have more than four people in the studio due to known reasons, which means a higher planning effort is required and explains the short notice of the announcement. However, at least three people will be on the switch, so we will be able to follow the Oscars 2021 with at least seven pieces of wood in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
We are doing our best to avoid delays or other problems. But hey, it's still a pandemic - yet we will do everything we can to make the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
The party will start around 0:30. Make sure to have cold drinks ready, plan for good food and get ready for a long, but very interesting night.
