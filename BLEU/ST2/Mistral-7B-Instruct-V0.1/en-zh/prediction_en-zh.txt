Gabba's double power failure explained and why it could happen again Risks of power failure inherent in the Gabba's broadcast compound set-up are unlikely to be improved before the next Ashes series, as cricket authorities await more detail on plans for the stadium's major upgrade to host the 2032 Olympic Games.

Sources have told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald that the Gabba is the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the mains power supply at the ground is not sufficient to fire up the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world. Primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.

Translation: According to sources, the only major stadium in Australian cricket where the power supply at the ground is insufficient to power the vast array of broadcast trucks and devices needed to beam pictures around the world is the Gabba. The primary and backup generators powering the global broadcast of the Gabba Test went down for about 25 minutes on day four.
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

That's because the base power in the precinct is required to supply the Gabba's light towers - one of which infamously went down during a Big Bash League match in 2019 - and the ground itself. As a result, broadcasters draw their primary power supply from a huge, diesel-fuelled generator hired for the Test match, with back-up power meant to be derived from a back-up generator.

(Note: The translation may not be 100% accurate due to the complexity of the original text and the nuances of the Chinese language.)
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

However, on day four of the Test match, the failure of the primary generator fused with the back-up generator, causing both to go down simultaneously and resulting in the total or partial loss of broadcast pictures and DRS for nearly 30 minutes. NEP, the company that provides the outside broadcast trucks and other facilities to Fox and Seven, has sought an explanation from the company that provided the generators.

[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

All other grounds to be used for the Ashes - Adelaide Oval, the MCG, the SCG and Bellerive Oval in Hobart - will provide mains power as the primary supply for broadcasters, leaving a diesel-powered generator as the back-up. This difference, which has caused considerable anxiety for the host broadcaster Fox Cricket in the past, was exacerbated during the Ashes Test by the vastly reduced crew of production and technical staff able to keep tabs on the myriad metaphorical balls being kept in the air throughout the match.

 [/INST] 所有其他的地方，包括Adelaide Oval、MCG、SCG和Hobart的Bellerive Oval，都将提供主要的电气供应，以供广播人员使用。这种差异，在过去对主要广播人员Fox Cricket造成了大量的挑战，在Ashes测试中被增加了，由于大规模减少的生产和技术人员队伍，不断地监控各种各样的虚拟球。

Currently, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is using three methods to detect COVID-19 variants: whole-genome analysis, target DNA (mutations such as spike protein) analysis, and PCR test. In the case of the Delta variant, it can be detected by the current PCR test, but Omicron cannot.

[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The newly developed technology this time is not a sequencing method that reads DNA or RNA sequences, but the molecular diagnostic technology. The existing technology screens only specific areas of the virus, but the molecular diagnostic technology was designed to cause nucleic acid-binding reactions only when the COVID-19 RNA exists, enabling rapid detection.

 [/INST] 本次发展的新技术不是一种读取DNA或RNA序列的序列方法，而是一种基因诊断技术。现有技术只能检测病毒的特定区域，但基因诊断技术是设计用于只有COVID-19RNA存在时发生核苷酸结合反应的，使得快速检测。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

According to Professor Lee, Omicron has a strong signal for N genes in PCR tests but has a weak signal for S genes. In the case of "Stealth Omicron," both N and S genes confirmed positive, making it difficult to distinguish from other variants.

 [/INST] 根據教授李的說法，Omicron對N基因在PCR測試上有強大的信號，但對S基因有弱大的信號。在“Stealth Omicron”的情況下，N和S基因都確認為正面，使其與其他變體很難分別。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

The molecular diagnostic technology works in different mechanisms from PCR, detecting the Omicron variant efficiently. Unlike conventional technology that generally processes up to 96 samples per device, the new technology can process more than 125 in 30 minutes (more than 250 samples per hour).

 [/INST] 分子诊断技术采用与PCR不同的机制，高效检测Omicron变体。传统技术通常可以处理每台设备最多96个样本，而新技术可以在30分钟内处理超过125个样本（每小时超过250个样本）。

In addition, this technology does not need specialized equipment, thus can make diagnostic kits simply and easily. As the method can develop the diagnosis kit in 4 days, it is expected to respond quickly even if a new variant or virus occurs in the future.

This technology is currently before commercialization. However, it can be used as an auxiliary in current situations where the PCR test for Omicron has not been developed.

 [/INST] 此技术目前还在商业化之前。然而，它可以在当前没有Omicron的PCR测试的情况下作为辅助使用。
[INST] Translate the following text from English to Chinese.

Professor Lee said, "I think this technology will be close to commercialization in the second half of next year after clinical trials. The reason why I disclose the technology is to share it with others to develop better technologies for overcoming COVID-19 and to allow underdeveloped countries also analyze COVID-19 variants."

 [/INST] 教授李说，“我认为这项技术在下一年的第二半将近商业化，经过临床试验。我透露这项技术的原因是为了与他人合作开发抗击COVID-19的更好技术，并允许未发展国家分析COVID-19变种。”
