Choosing an appropriate foot bath can bring good therapeutic effects, and today's US small editors will answer this question for you. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, foot baths and traditional household electrical appliances sell well, but foot baths do not have their own industry standards, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as whether it can be used at the highest temperature, which groups of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, and so on. However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may have been produced without strict quality control during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks.

According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk. “Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!” Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it. Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function. Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified. Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it. Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc. But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory. Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin. There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated. Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it."}

{"translation2": "Chinese to English Translation:  A coalition of Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League schools, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. Over 100 Asian-American groups submitted the complaint on May 23, protesting the discrimination against Asian-American applicants by these three Ivy League schools. The Asian American Education Foundation held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the lawsuit. The president of the coalition, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three Ivy League schools has increased tenfold in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-Americans admitted has remained basically unchanged. Many studies have shown that these schools systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the \"holistic consideration\" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of Asian-American applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups, and the admission rate was the lowest. The data of the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit the complaint and request the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. They also hope that the schools involved in the lawsuit will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans. The three schools involved in the lawsuit have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination against Asian-Americans, but the U.S. Department of Education did not process the complaint for procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups also participated in the lawsuit.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Wrong Translation: The president of the coalition is named as 'Zhao Yuchun' in the evaluated text, whereas in the reference text the name given is 'Zhao Yukong'.\", \"Wrong Translation: In the evaluated text, the organization is referred to as 'The Asian American Education Foundation', whereas in the reference text the correct name is 'Asian American Coalition for Education'.\", \"Addition: The evaluated text refers to the complaint as a 'lawsuit' multiple times, whereas in the reference text, it’s referred to only as a 'complaint'.\"] } }", "reference": "Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
