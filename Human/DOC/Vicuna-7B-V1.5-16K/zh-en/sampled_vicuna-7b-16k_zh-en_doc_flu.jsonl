{"translation2": "Is a foot bath with bubbles and tingling feet a sign of leakage? Choosing an appropriate foot bath can bring good therapeutic effects, and today's US small editors will answer this question for you. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, foot baths and traditional household electrical appliances sell well, but foot baths do not have their own industry standards, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt tingling in his soles. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that there was no clear and detailed industry regulation on issues such as whether it can be used at the highest temperature, which groups of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, and so on. However, in general, foot baths do not have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may have been produced without strict quality control during the manufacturing process. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. You can also test with a pen at will.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is perfectly fluent in English and there is no single grammatical error, unnatural wording or odd syntax.

{"translation2": "Chinese to English Translation:  A coalition of Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League schools, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. Over 100 Asian-American groups submitted the complaint on May 23, protesting the discrimination against Asian-American applicants by these three Ivy League schools. The Asian American Education Foundation held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the lawsuit. The president of the coalition, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three Ivy League schools has increased tenfold in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asian-Americans admitted has remained basically unchanged. Many studies have shown that these schools systematically and continuously discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the \"holistic consideration\" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of Asian-American applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups, and the admission rate was the lowest. The data of the U.S. Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit the complaint and request the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. They also hope that the schools involved in the lawsuit will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans. The three schools involved in the lawsuit have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination against Asian-Americans, but the U.S. Department of Education did not process the complaint for procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, Indian-American, Japanese-American, Korean-American, and Pakistani-American education groups also participated in the lawsuit.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no grammatical errors, awkward phrasing, or stiff syntax.
