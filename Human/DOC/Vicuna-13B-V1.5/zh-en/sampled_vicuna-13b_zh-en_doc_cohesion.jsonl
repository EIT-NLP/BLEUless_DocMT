Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's awareness of health, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from less than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice. According to related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are booming, but foot baths do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li used a pen to test it, and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was conductive. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath was refunded, Mr. Li still felt uneasy. Because he found that the popular foot bath that has been around for a long time now has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, suitability for which population, and guarantee of safety materials. However, in general, foot baths are unlikely to have a problem with electricity, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a detachable foot bath. The water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety risk. At the same time, you can use a pen to test it at will.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ \"'feet bath basin' changed to 'foot bath', 'is it a leakage' instead of 'leakage of electricity', 'pen' instead of 'tester'\" ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin? Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you. As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options. According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk. “Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!” Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it. Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function. Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified. Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it. Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc. But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory. Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin. There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated. Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it."}

{"translation2": "Asian-American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian-American organizations in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, accusing Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. The chairman of the alliance, Zhao Yuanguo, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of Ivy League schools has increased many times, but the proportion of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these schools have systematically and continuously discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic review\" admissions process. Zhao Yuanguo introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the acceptance rate of Asian-Americans relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuanguo told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in the admissions process after determining the facts. They also hope that the complained-against schools will take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans. So far, the three schools have not responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds. This time, in addition to American Chinese organizations, the complaint also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.", "gpt_response": "{\n  \"Cohesion\": {\n    \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"Asian-American groups file complaint\": Different wording compared to reference \"Asian communities in the US complains\",\n      \"Xinhua News Agency\": Suggestion to maintain \"Xinhua Net\" as introduced earlier for consistency,\n      \"130 Asian-American organizations\": Mentioned explicitly as \"130\", whereas reference used \"more than 130\",\n      \"Asian American Education Alliance\": Name of the group isn't consistent with \"Asian American Coalition for Education\" in the reference text\n    ],\n    \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"on the 23rd\": Inconsistent with reference date mention, should simplify to \"on May 23\",\n      \"the same day\": Could specify \"that day\" to match the reference and improve cohesion,\n      \"the complained-against schools\": Phrasing is clunky; could be smoother as \"the universities being complained about\"\n    ]\n  }\n}", "reference": "Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US."}
