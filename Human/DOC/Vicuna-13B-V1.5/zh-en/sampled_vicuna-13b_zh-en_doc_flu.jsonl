{"translation2": "Taking a foot bath with tingling feet, is it a leakage? Choosing a suitable foot bath can have a good therapeutic effect on foot care. Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's awareness of health, foot baths have become increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from less than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice. According to related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of foot baths and other health-related household appliances are booming, but foot baths do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li used a pen to test it, and the pen lit up. Mr. Li was surprised to find that the water in the foot bath was conductive. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad. Although the foot bath was refunded, Mr. Li still felt uneasy. Because he found that the popular foot bath that has been around for a long time now has no clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, suitability for which population, and guarantee of safety materials. However, in general, foot baths are unlikely to have a problem with electricity, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a detachable foot bath. The water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety risk. At the same time, you can use a pen to test it at will.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is mostly fluent, with minor errors in wording that do not impede understanding.

{"translation2": "Asian-American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian-American organizations in the United States filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice on the 23rd, accusing Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College of discriminating against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. The chairman of the alliance, Zhao Yuanguo, said at the press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission requirements of Ivy League schools has increased many times, but the proportion of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these schools have systematically and continuously discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic review\" admissions process. Zhao Yuanguo introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the acceptance rate of Asian-Americans relative to the number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also show that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students, and Yale University and Brown University have effectively implemented racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuanguo told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Department of Justice will launch an investigation and take measures to stop these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in the admissions process after determining the facts. They also hope that the complained-against schools will take this issue seriously and change their admissions policies towards Asian-Americans. So far, the three schools have not responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admissions discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education refused to accept it on procedural grounds. This time, in addition to American Chinese organizations, the complaint also includes Indian-American, Korean-American, Japanese-American, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.", "gpt_response": "{\n  \"Fluency\": {\n    \"Score\": \"4\",\n    \"Explanation\": \"The text is mostly fluent with a few minor issues.
