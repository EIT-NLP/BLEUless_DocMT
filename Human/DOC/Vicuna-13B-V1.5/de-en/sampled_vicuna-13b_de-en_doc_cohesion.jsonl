{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, leading to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly replicates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are introducing a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound quality. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers deliver an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also include the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply do a better job of capturing the tonal variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system that brings out the natural resonances. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound the way you've always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduction of the VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to meet new sound requirements, leading to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models. The new VT+ Valvetronix series, from the handy VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, has been designed so that all guitarists seeking maximum sound variety will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the power stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding. The 12AX7 tube-equipped Valve Reactor circuit of each VT+ amplifier perfectly replicates the behavior, subtle nuances, and sound character of a tube amplifier.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

{"translation2": "Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg at Merlins Crailsheim At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, let them down. Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said looking back on the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \"We still have some anger in our belly\". But that didn't calm down after the game, on the contrary, it increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas more than the bare result disappointed the way of appearance. A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma may be cited as an example: the three-point quote was a mere 13 percent, 4 baskets (all from young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions? The answer came from John Patrick: \"We were simply not concentrated enough after the win in Tenerife and did not implement what we trained for.\" Namely, to move the ball. Quite different reacted his counterpart Sebastian Gleim: \"A great game for the second time against Ludwigsburg to win,\" said the happy coach. \"It felt like in front of 10,000 people.\" Although only 750 visitors were allowed in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, they made up for it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led the game for his team. \"The best player I've ever trained,\" Gleim praised him still. While in Patrick's team, the key players like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) completely failed. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the giants prevent a complete disaster and came within eight points after they were already 39:59 behind.

{"translation2": "I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello, dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I would like to vent a little with this post. First of all, during today's F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted mid-race to start the F1 pre-coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the opening lap accident were far behind schedule, they could still have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!) Instead, it seems that due to legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race. Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then, in F1, there was again a lack of knowledge about the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to Hamilton. Both Sky UK and RTL commentators knew immediately that Verstappen had this option. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on a pay-TV channel's F1. It is also not the first puzzle that is now allowed or required according to the rules, both have constant uncertainties about the rules. Generally, I don't like Roos' artificial commentary style, but I have to admit that taste is subjective. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL is better in my opinion. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply make unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \"UuuuuHD\" from Ralf Schumacher. The latter, in particular, brings a lot of chaos into the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, advertising is simply getting out of hand at Sky, in the final lap, Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as you can hear on F1TV, the German audio track without commentary has to be used directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Also, these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. Although one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not make up for the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats. Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that transmits F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job in terms of advertising with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the fantastic F1 season would be much less fun with a reasonable broadcaster than it actually is. I would be interested in your opinion.", "gpt_response": "```json\n{\n  \"Cohesion\": {\n    \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"repetitive use of 'nevertheless' in close proximity without connecting or contrasting additional information effectively\",\n      \"use of 'F1' and 'Sky' without variations, which could have been replaced or alternated with synonyms or descriptors to avoid repetition\",\n      \"repetitive use of 'rules' and 'commentators' without sufficient variation to maintain interest\"\n    ],\n    \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"lack of variety in transitional phrases to effectively signal contrasts or comparisons ('Instead' and 'Nevertheless' are used, but more variety could enhance flow)\",\n      \"inconsistent use of tense (e.g., mix of present and past tense without clear reason for shifts)\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end.

Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages.

In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
