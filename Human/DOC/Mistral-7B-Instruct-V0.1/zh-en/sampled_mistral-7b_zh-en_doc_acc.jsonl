With the increasing awareness of health, electric foot spas are becoming more popular among consumers. In the market, there are many different types of foot spas available, ranging from a few hundred to thousands of dollars. This gives consumers a lot of choices. According to relevant data, sales of electric foot spas and other health-related household appliances have been booming, but there are no specific industry standards for electric foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. \"Dipping your feet in electricity is too dangerous, isn't it?\" Li said to the reporter. Recently, he bought an electric foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but when his father used it, he felt his feet going numb. Li first thought it was the vibration function of the foot spa that caused it, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet going numb. Li used an electric pen to test it, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. After contacting the seller, the seller's attitude was not bad, but Li still felt uncomfortable after returning the foot spa. Because he found that this popular foot spa did not have any clear and detailed industry regulations regarding the highest temperature setting, the target audience, and the materials used to ensure safety. However, in general, electric foot spas are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have issues during manufacturing. Therefore, when buying, it is recommended to choose a foot spa with a modular design. Water and electricity separation, no safety risks.

According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk. “Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!” Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it. Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function. Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified. Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it. Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc. But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.

{"translation2": "Chinese to English Translation:  On May 23rd, 2021, over 130 Chinese American organizations submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice, accusing three well-known Ivy League universities - Yale University, Brown University, and Duke University - of discriminating against Chinese American applicants during the recruitment process. The head of the Chinese American Education Association (CAEA) announced at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Chinese American applicants who meet the criteria for admission to Ivy League universities has grown exponentially, but the proportion of Chinese Americans in these three universities has remained relatively stable.  Numerous studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Chinese American applicants in the so-called \"comprehensive evaluation\" recruitment process. The CAEA introduced that according to research by Sedgwick et al. in 2014, the relative number of applicants and the acceptance rate of Chinese Americans in these three universities is the lowest among all ethnic groups. The US Department of Education's data also shows that in all Ivy League schools, Duke University and Brown University have the lowest acceptance rates for Chinese American students, while Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto quota system for Chinese American applicants for over 20 years.  The CAEA hopes that after submitting the complaint, the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice will conduct an investigation and take action to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Chinese Americans in recruitment. The CAEA also hopes that the three universities will actively address this issue and change their recruitment policies. As of now, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Chinese American Education Association was founded in 2015 and previously submitted a complaint against Harvard University for discriminating against Chinese American applicants, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of procedure. This time, in addition to Chinese American organizations, other organizations such as Indian American, Korean American, Japanese American, and Pakistani American education organizations also participated in the complaint.", "gpt_response": "```json\n{\n  \"Accuracy\": {\n    \"Mistakes\": [\n      \"Wrong Translation: The text wrongly names 'Duke University' instead of 'Dartmouth College' among the accused universities.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: The text mentions 'Chinese American Education Association (CAEA)' which is inaccurately specified instead of 'Asian American Coalition for Education'.\",\n      \"Wrong Translation: The researchers are incorrectly named as 'Sedgwick et al.' instead of 'Saunders'.\",\n      \"Omission: The text omits the specific details that the complaint was made against the 'long-term, continuous, and systematic way of discrimination'.\",\n      \"Omission: There was also a lack of specific mention of all Asian groups' participation in the complaint, just a generic reference at the end.\",\n      \"Other: The rephrasing 'relative number of applicants and the acceptance rate' may confuse the direct comparison meant by low acceptance rate against the proportion of applicants.\",\n      \"Addition: The date 'May 23rd, 2021,' seems added and incorrect, as the year isn't mentioned in the original text.\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```", "reference": "Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US."}
