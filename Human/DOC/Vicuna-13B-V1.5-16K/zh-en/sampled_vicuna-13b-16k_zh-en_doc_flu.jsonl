Choosing a suitable foot bath basin can have good therapeutic and health effects on your feet. Today, the editor of Jingmei Xiao will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins have become more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred yuan to thousands of yuan, giving consumers a lot of choice. In terms of related data, compared with traditional household appliances, the sales of health-related household appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in an electrified water!\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt a tingling sensation in his feet when soaking. Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath basin, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a flashlight and surprisingly found that the water in the foot bath basin was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although he returned the foot bath basin, Mr. Li still felt dissatisfied. Because he found that this popular foot bath basin, which has been around for a long time, has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety. However, in general, foot bath basins are not prone to electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular foot bath basin. Separation of water and electricity, no safety hazards. At the same time, you can test it with a flashlight at will.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The English in this text is highly fluent.
