{"translation2": "Is the foot bath tank leaking electricity? Can the right foot bath tank bring health benefits? Today, the editors of Country美小编 will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath tanks are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tanks and other health-related household appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tanks, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath tank as a gift for his father's birthday, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them. At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath tank, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath tank was electric. Later, he contacted the store, and although the store was willing to refund the foot bath tank, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular foot bath tank, which has been around for a long time, lacks clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees. However, in general, foot bath tanks do not have electricity problems, but there is a small number of products that may not have been strictly inspected during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath tank. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. At the same time, you can take a pen to test.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ {\"Type\": \"Wrong Translation\", \"Details\": \"The original mention of 'Gome' was translated as 'Country美小编' in the evaluated text.\"}, {\"Type\": \"Wrong Translation\", \"Details\": \"The original text says 'Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on', however, the evaluated text says 'Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up', which changes the original meaning.\"}, {\"Type\": \"Wrong Translation\", \"Details\": \"The term 'split type feet bath basin' has been translated as 'disassembled foot bath tank'.\"} ]} }", "reference": "Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin? Choosing the right feet bath basin can provide good pedicure and healthcare, and today Gome will answer this question; hopefully it will be helpful to you. As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options. According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk. “Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!” Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it. Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function. Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified. Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it. Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc. But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory. Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin. There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated. Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it."}

{"translation2": "A coalition of 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against the admission discrimination faced by three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - in their recruitment process. The coalition held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint. The coalition's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three U.S. universities has increased tenfold in the past decade, but their proportion in these universities has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic consideration\" admission process, which is \"long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian-American applicants.\" Zhao Yuxuan introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among the members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, while Harvard University and Brown University had been practicing de facto racial quotas for Asian-American students for over 20 years. Zhao Yuxuan told reporters from China News Service that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department would investigate and take measures to stop these three universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American students in their admission process. They also hoped that the universities would proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-American students. Currently, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Asian-American Education Union was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, the coalition also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Wrong Translation: The evaluated text incorrectly mentions Harvard University as one of the Ivy League schools complained about instead of Yale University which is mentioned in the reference text.\", \"Wrong Translation: The name of the coalition's Chairman is incorrectly translated as Zhao Yuxuan in the evaluated text, whereas the reference text refers to him as Zhao Yukong.\", \"Addition: The evaluated text includes the mention of 'China News Service' which is not present in the reference text.\", \"Wrong Translation: The group being referred to in the evaluated text as 'Asian-American Education Union' is called 'Asian American Coalition for Education' in the reference text.\" ]} }", "reference": "Asian communities in the US complains about admission discrimination by Yale and two other Ivy League universities - Xinhuanet Message from Xinhua News Agency Washington on May 23 (journalist: Xu Jianmei): More than 130 Asian communities in the US submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice in the US on May 23 to protest against the discrimination on Asian students in the enrollment of 3 Ivy League universities, Yale University, Brown University and Dartmouth College. Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US."}
