{"translation2": "Is the foot bath tank leaking electricity? Can the right foot bath tank bring health benefits? Today, the editors of Country美小编 will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath tanks are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices. According to relevant data, compared with traditional household appliances, foot bath tanks and other health-related household appliances are selling like hotcakes, but there is no specific industry standard for foot bath tanks, so there are certain safety risks. \"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath tank as a gift for his father's birthday, but his father felt numbness in his feet after soaking them. At first, Mr. Li thought it was due to the vibration function of the foot bath tank, but when he turned off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that the water in the foot bath tank was electric. Later, he contacted the store, and although the store was willing to refund the foot bath tank, Mr. Li still felt unhappy. Because he found that this popular foot bath tank, which has been around for a long time, lacks clear and detailed industry standards in terms of the highest temperature setting, applicable user groups, materials, and safety guarantees. However, in general, foot bath tanks do not have electricity problems, but there is a small number of products that may not have been strictly inspected during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a disassembled foot bath tank. Water and electricity are separated, and there are no safety risks. At the same time, you can take a pen to test.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"This text is entirely fluent, with no serious errors that impede understanding.

{"translation2": "A coalition of 130 Asian-American groups filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, protesting against the admission discrimination faced by three Ivy League schools - Harvard University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - in their recruitment process. The coalition held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint. The coalition's chairman, Zhao Yuxuan, said at the press conference that the number of Asian-American applicants who meet the admission criteria of these three U.S. universities has increased tenfold in the past decade, but their proportion in these universities has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian-American applicants in the so-called \"holistic consideration\" admission process, which is \"long-term and systematically discriminating against Asian-American applicants.\" Zhao Yuxuan introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the relative number of applicants, Asian-Americans had the lowest admission rate among all ethnic groups. Data from the U.S. Department of Education also showed that among the members of the Ivy League, Brown University and Dartmouth College had the lowest admission rate for Asian-American students, while Harvard University and Brown University had been practicing de facto racial quotas for Asian-American students for over 20 years. Zhao Yuxuan told reporters from China News Service that they hoped that after submitting the complaint, the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department would investigate and take measures to stop these three universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-American students in their admission process. They also hoped that the universities would proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asian-American students. Currently, the three universities have not responded to the complaint. The Asian-American Education Union was established in 2015 and had previously filed a complaint against Harvard University's admission discrimination, but the U.S. Department of Education did not accept the complaint due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese-American groups, the coalition also included American Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani-American educational organizations.", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.
