{"translation2": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \"Valve Reactor\" circuit, which perfectly imitates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we are presenting a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers wait with an authenticity that is absolutely impressive. Of course, these amps also feature the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier, which partly relies on real analog circuits because these are better at capturing the variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuit, the VTX amplifiers also offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances just flow. With the \"Tone Room\" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level, so that the amp and effects sound exactly as you have always imagined it. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the 2001 introduced VOX Valve Reactor technology. Of course, it has been refined several times since then to also meet new sound requirements, which led to another performance boost of the VOX Valvetronix series in 2010 - with more dynamics as well as numerous and decisively improved amplifier models. From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has also been designed in such a way that all guitarists looking for maximum sound diversity will find what they're looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, as well as prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.

{"translation2": "Basketball Bundesliga: Derby Disaster of the MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against the Merlins Crailsheim At least youngster Johannes Patrick was left out. Again nothing: For the second time within less than three months, the Riesen lost in Crailsheim - and how! Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick looked back on the cup defeat in October at the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim and said: \"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\" But that anger didn't subside after the game - it even increased due to the 61:72 (28:38) loss in the Basketball Bundesliga. Whereas the result alone was enough to disappoint, the way the Riesen performed was even more disappointing. A statistic that expresses the entire dilemma: The three-point percentage was just 13%, 4 shots (all by young Johannes Patrick) out of 31 attempts - more questions? John Patrick's answer was: \"We weren't concentrated enough after our win in Tenerife and didn't implement what we had trained.\" In other words, moving the ball. Sebastian Gleim, his opponent, had a completely different reaction: \"It was a great game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg,\" said the happy coach. \"It felt like we were playing in front of 10,000 people.\" There were only 750 spectators in the Hohenlohe Arena on Saturday, but they made the most of it. Not least because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. \"The best playmaker I've ever trained,\" praised Gleim. Meanwhile, the performance leaders in Patrick's team, such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7), failed on the entire court. Only in the last quarter (22:15) did the Riesen avoid a total debacle and came within eight points of a comeback, after they had already trailed 39:59. Along with Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon scored 12 points. Luckily, there's not much time left to worry.

{"translation2": "I am getting frustrated with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on the German Sky has gradually decreased, so I want to vent a bit in this post. Firstly, the transmission was abruptly interrupted during the F2 race to start the F1 coverage on time. Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the race were behind the schedule, Sky DE could have shown the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision anyway. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it's still dumb, especially since Sky UK broadcast the race until the end. However, a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding message", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Omission: The evaluated text is incomplete, it cuts off mid sentence at the end\", \"Other: The evaluated text misspelt the name of the announcer, it's Olivier Zwartyes not Zwartjes.\", \"Other: The evaluated text mistranslated that Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to 'the unfortunate accident', while the reference states 'difficult situation and the unfortunate accident.'\", \"Other: The evaluated text translates annoy as 'frustrate.'

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn’t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
