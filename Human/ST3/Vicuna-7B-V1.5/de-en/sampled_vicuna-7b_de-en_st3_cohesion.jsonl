With VOX’s “Tone Room” software, you can even correct and bend historical facts on a virtual plane until the amp and the effects sound just like you have always imagined them. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is above all thanks to the VOX valve reactor technology introduced in 2001.

{"translation1": "\"I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, the quality on the German Sky has decreased significantly throughout the season, so I want to vent a bit with this post. Firstly, the transmission was interrupted during the F2 race to ensure punctual F1 coverage.Although the schedule was significantly behind due to the delayed start and the crash at the beginning, it would still have been possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes as well as the championship decision. However, it seems that for legal reasons, F1 has priority and everything else has to be restricted, so Sky DE probably had no choice. Sky UK, on the other hand, broadcast the race until the end.Despite a small compliment: the commentator Olivier Zwartjes has accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident well. Then there was again a rule incompetence among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages to this topic to Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there is a possibility for Verstappen. I believe that one should simply know such elementary rules when commenting on Formula 1 for a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first riddle regarding what is now allowed or prescribed by the rules, both have simply had constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it is a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL much better, even though I don't like his constant jokes, which make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee at (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The last one brings total chaos in the commentary, which he apparently does not take seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, and in the final stretch, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as one can hear from F1TV after the race, where only the German soundtrack without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Both of these channels make less advertising during their training than Sky, and that as a free TV channel. Although I must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, this alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the Sky Sport F1 program is also very scarce and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is truly the worst German-speaking broadcaster for Formula 1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to transmit, except for the advertising. So, at least, the grandiose F1 season makes significantly less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would be interested in your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "```json\n{\n  \"Cohesion\": {\n    \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"The use of 'Hello dear F1 fans' differs from 'Hello F1 fans' in the reference text, varying the introduction unnecessarily.\",\n      \"The term 'to ensure punctual F1 coverage' is a slight variation from 'to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1' which may affect lexical cohesion.\",\n      \"Instead of 'Sky DE', 'Sky Germany' from the reference text maintains the formal tone and consistency.\",\n      \"The term 'commentator' was used instead of 'announcer', altering the lexical choice.\",\n      \"The phrase 'around the heavy accident' deviates from 'to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident', possibly affecting the cohesiveness.\",\n      \"Using 'However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL much better' instead of contrasting Heiko Wasser and Roos directly affects the structure and clarity.\",\n      \"Replacing 'cool-down lap' with 'final stretch' changes the specific terminology of F1, affecting cohesion with the reference text's vocabulary.\"\n    ],\n    \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [\n      \"There's a missing conjunctive 'but' or 'although' in the sentence beginning with 'Although the schedule was significantly behind', affecting the sentence's connection to the preceding information.\",\n      \"The omission of 'it seems that' before 'for legal reasons' causes a break in the sentence flow, which is present in the reference text.\",\n      \"The transition 'Despite a small compliment:' is less cohesive than 'In spite of that, some small praise:' from the reference text because it does not properly link back to the previous criticism.\",\n      \"The sentence 'Then there was again a rule incompetence among the commentators' lacks a bridging conjunction or phrase to connect it cohesively with the previous idea.\",\n      \"The repeated use of 'Sky UK and RTL, both commentators' causes confusion because 'both' is used without clear reference.

First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident.

In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages.
