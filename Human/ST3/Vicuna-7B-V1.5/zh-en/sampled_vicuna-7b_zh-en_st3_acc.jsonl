Today, the country's small editor will answer this question and hope to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs are increasingly favored by consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, healthcare appliances such as foot baths are selling like hotcakes. However, there is no dedicated industry standard for foot baths, which poses a certain safety risk. \\\"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water, isn't it?\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a foot bath as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet, he felt a tingling sensation in his soles.Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that was causing the sensation in his feet, but he didn't realize that he had turned off the vibration function. Even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store and the store's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.Because he discovered that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation on the popular bathtub that has been around for a long time, such as how to set the highest temperature, which group of people it is suitable for, what materials are guaranteed to be safe, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to have electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly inspected during the manufacturing process. Therefore, it is recommended to choose a disassembled bathtub when purchasing.Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards. At the same time, you can freely take an electric pen test.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Accuracy\": { \"Mistakes\": [ \"Wrong Translation: The evaluated text replaces 'feet bath basin' with 'bathtub', which changes the meaning of the text.\", \"Wrong Translation: 'Gome' has been mistranslated as 'the country's small editor'.\", \"Omission: The evaluated text omits the information about the price range of feet bath basins.\", \"Omission: The evaluated text omits the report about what happened when 'Mr. Li used a tester'.\", \"Addition: The evaluated text adds the detail 'Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up.', which is not present in the reference text\", \"Omission: The evaluated text does not mention 'what Mr. Li found when he used a tester'.\" ]} }", "reference": "Does it mean there is leakage of electricity if my feet feel numb in the feet bath basin?

As people care more about healthcare, feet bath basin has become more popular among the customers, and a large batch of products of different levels have emerged on the market, from a little more than 100 yuan up to a thousand yuan, giving the customers a lot of options. According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk. “Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!” Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it. Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function. Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified. Then he contacted the seller, whose attitude was nice, but Mr. Li still felt upset although he had returned it. Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc. But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory. Therefore, choose split type feet bath basin. There is no safety risk when water and electricity are separated. Meanwhile, you can use a tester to test it."}

The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington D.C. on the same day.The chairman of this group, Zhao Yuchun, said at the press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top universities has doubled, but in these three top American universities, the proportion of Asians remains basically the same. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the \\\"holistic consideration\\\" admission process. Zhao Yuchun introduced that a study by Sanders and others in 2014 showed that in these three universities, the admission rate for Asians was the lowest among all ethnic groups relative to the number of applicants.The data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yushuo told a reporter from Xinhua that they hope to submit a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to investigate and take action after the fact to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asians in their admissions. They also hope that the universities that have been complained about will proactively address this issue and change their admission policies towards Asians.Currently, the three schools that have been complained about have not made any responses. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, when it filed a complaint against Harvard University's discriminatory admissions practices.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
