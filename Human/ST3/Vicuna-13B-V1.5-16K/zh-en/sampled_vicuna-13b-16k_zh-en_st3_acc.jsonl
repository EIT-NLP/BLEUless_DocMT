Mr. Li tried using a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conducting electricity.

Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and persistently discriminated against Asian applicants in their so-called \\\"holistic\\\" admission process. Zhao Yu Kong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asians was the lowest compared to the number of applicants of all ethnicities.According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in recruitment. They also hope that the universities being sued will take the issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.Currently, the three colleges that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students.
