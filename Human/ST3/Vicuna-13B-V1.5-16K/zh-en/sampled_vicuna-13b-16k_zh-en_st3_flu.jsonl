As for the price of Huawei Mate 30 Pro, it's not too expensive. Personally, I think the Huawei Mate 30 Pro is really good. The gaming experience is smooth and comfortable, and I can play most games smoothly, including PUBG Mobile at high frame rates, and I can easily win in games like LOL and CSGO. Most 3A games are also playable.Heat dissipation effect: The heat dissipation effect is not bad, the fan is quite powerful, and the work is relatively quiet. The game effect is also quite good when the fan is set to full speed. The appearance is quite cool, and the display effect of the game itself is quite clear.

{"translation1": "\"Taking a foot bath and getting an electric shock from the bubbles? Choosing the right foot bath basin can have excellent therapeutic and health effects on the feet. Today, the editor of Jumei will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, foot bath basins are becoming more and more popular among consumers, and a large number of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, providing consumers with a wide range of choices, from more than 100 yuan to thousands of yuan.In related data, compared with traditional home appliances, sales of health-related home appliances such as foot bath basins are booming, but foot bath basins do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \\\"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\\\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a foot bath basin as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking.Mr. Li initially thought it was caused by the vibration function of the foot bath, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation on the soles of his feet. Mr. Li tried using a pen, and surprisingly, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the foot bath was conducting electricity. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, even though he returned the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt unhappy.Because he found that this popular foot bath basin has no clear and detailed industry regulations in terms of applicable population, materials guaranteeing safety at the highest temperature setting, etc. However, generally speaking, foot bath basins do not have electrical problems, but it cannot be ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during production. Therefore, when purchasing, choose a modular foot bath basin.Water and electricity are separated, and there is no safety hazard.

{"translation1": "\"More than 130 Asian American organizations in the US submitted a complaint to the US Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, accusing three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - of discriminating against Asian American applicants in their admission process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which led the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day. - Xu Jianmei, Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 23rd.The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yu Kong, said at a press conference that in the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of top American universities has increased many times over, but the proportion of Asians in these three top American universities has remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities have systematically and persistently discriminated against Asian applicants in their so-called \\\"holistic\\\" admission process. Zhao Yu Kong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three universities, the acceptance rate of Asians was the lowest compared to the number of applicants of all ethnicities.According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian-American students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian-American applicants for more than 20 years. Zhu Yu told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a lawsuit and urge the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice to investigate and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian-Americans in recruitment. They also hope that the universities being sued will take the issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian-Americans.Currently, the three colleges that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discrimination in admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept it due to procedural reasons. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's appeal also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent with no errors.
