{"translation1": "\"Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim. At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, held up. Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, had said with regard to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \\\"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\\\" However, this did not subside after the game, but rather increased in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga.

John Patrick answered: \\\"We were not concentrated enough after the win in Tenerife and did not implement what we trained for, namely moving the ball.\\\"His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted very differently: \\\"It was awesome to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg,\\\" said the happy coach. \\\"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.\\\" Although only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, they made the most of it.Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J.

{"translation1": "\"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, today during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.Although the delayed start and the starting accident disrupted the schedule, it was still possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision. Apparently, however, legal reasons give F1 priority, and therefore everything else must be restricted, which is why Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the entire race.Nonetheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something that is possible or required is a puzzle. Both have constant uncertainties about the rules.Generally, I don't like Roos's artificial commentary style, but I acknowledge that it's a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL even more serious. Additionally, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The latter brings a lot of unrest in the commentary, as he clearly does not take it seriously. Advertising simply takes over at Sky, as can be heard in the out lap, where Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary is sufficient and must be played directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Both of these broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overlook the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job except for the advertising during the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the magnificent F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [] } }", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn’t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
