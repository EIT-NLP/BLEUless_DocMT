{"translation1": "\"Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously evolved, which among other things has led to the combination of advanced modeling technology with the \\\"Valve Reactor\\\" circuit, which perfectly emulates the behavior of a tube amplifier. With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X amps, we are presenting a completely new modeling engine that is absolutely state-of-the-art in terms of sound. Thanks to the VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers offer an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.Even these amps, of course, contain the multi-stage Valvetronix tube preamplifier. This is based in part on real analog circuits because they simply better capture the sound variations and nuances of a tube amplifier than any simulation. In addition to this sophisticated circuitry, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed housing and a bass reflex system from which the natural resonances simply burst forth.With the \\\"Tone Room\\\" software from VOX, you can even correct and bend historical facts on the virtual level until the amp and effects sound like you've always imagined. The perfect combination of tube sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology introduced in 2001. Of course, it has since been refined several times to meet new sound requirements, which in 2010 led to a performance boost for the VOX Valvetronix series - with more dynamics and numerous and significantly improved amplifier models.From the compact VT20+ to the VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series has been designed so that all guitarists looking for maximum sound variety will find what they are looking for. All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and a quick response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage in particular determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.The valve reactor circuit of every VT+ amplifier, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, perfectly reproduces the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is extremely fluent in English.

{"translation1": "\"Basketball Bundesliga: Derby disaster for MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg against Merlins Crailsheim. At least one youngster, Johannes Patrick, held up. Again nothing: for the second time in less than three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach, John Patrick, had said with regard to the cup defeat at the beginning of October against the Hakro Merlins Crailsheim: \\\"We still have some anger in our stomachs.\\\" However, this did not subside after the game, but rather increased in light of the 61:72 (28:38) defeat in the Basketball Bundesliga. Although the bare result was disappointing, what was even more disheartening was the manner and style of the team's performance.A substitute statistic expresses the whole dilemma: The three-point shot percentage was only 13 percent, 4 shots (all from young John Patrick) out of 31 attempts - any questions? John Patrick answered: \\\"We were not concentrated enough after the win in Tenerife and did not implement what we trained for, namely moving the ball.\\\"His counterpart, Sebastian Gleim, reacted very differently: \\\"It was awesome to win the game for the second time against Ludwigsburg,\\\" said the happy coach. \\\"It felt like playing in front of 10,000 people.\\\" Although only 750 visitors were allowed on Saturday in the Hohenlohe Arena, they made the most of it.Not least also because of BBL top scorer T.J. Shorts, who scored 22 points and led his team's game. \\\"The best playmaker I've ever trained,\\\" praised Gleim again. While in Patrick's team, even the key performers like Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebaugh (7) underperformed.Only in the last quarter (22:15) the giants prevented a complete rout and came within eight points after they had already trailed 39:59. Besides Johannes Patrick, Justin Simon also scored twelve points. Fortunately, there was not much time for complaining.Already on Wednesday (at 8 pm) the Giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg a maximum of 750 spectators.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent, albeit complex with its detailed reporting of a basketball game.

{"translation1": "\"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1. Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has deteriorated more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, today during the F2 race, the broadcast was interrupted to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.Although the delayed start and the starting accident disrupted the schedule, it was still possible to show the last ten minutes (planned) and the championship decision. Apparently, however, legal reasons give F1 priority, and therefore everything else must be restricted, which is why Sky DE had no choice. Nevertheless, it's stupid, especially since Sky UK broadcasted the entire race.Nonetheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes has well accompanied the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was again a lack of knowledge of the rules among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there was already such a situation in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the decision that Verstappen can change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.At Sky UK as well as RTL, both commentators immediately knew that there was this possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that such basic rules should simply be known when commentating on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first time that now, according to the rules, something that is possible or required is a puzzle. Both have constant uncertainties about the rules.Generally, I don't like Roos's artificial commentary style, but I acknowledge that it's a matter of taste. However, I find Heiko Wasser from RTL even more serious. Additionally, there are constant sillinesses that make both of them appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The latter brings a lot of unrest in the commentary, as he clearly does not take it seriously. Advertising simply takes over at Sky, as can be heard in the out lap, where Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German sound track without commentary is sufficient and must be played directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Both of these broadcasters also make less advertising in training than Sky, and that as a free-to-air broadcaster. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overlook the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job except for the advertising during the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the magnificent F1 season is much less fun than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The text can be considered mostly fluent.
