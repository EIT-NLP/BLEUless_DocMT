With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs have become more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are selling hot, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety risks. \\\"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet in it, he felt a tingling sensation in his feet.At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused the sensation, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they refunded the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the popular bathtub, such as whether it is suitable for what kind of people, what kind of materials are used, and whether it is safe at the highest setting. However, in general, bathtubs do not have electricity problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not be strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing a bathtub, it is recommended to choose a disassembled type.Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards.

According to related statistics, compared with traditional home appliances, the sales of healthcare products such as feet bath basin was hot, but there is no specialized industry standard for feet bath basin and so there is potential safety risk. “Having a feet bath in the water with electricity is too dangerous!” Mr. Li told reporter that he recently bought a feet bath basin for his father as a birthday present, but his father felt that the bottom of his feet were numb when using it. Mr. Li first thought it was caused by the vibration function of the feet bath basin, and it was unexpected that his father still felt his feet were numb after turning off the vibration function. Mr. Li used a tester and the light on it was on; it was to Mr. Li’s surprise that the water in the feet bath basin was electrified.

Because he found that feet bath basin, which has been popular for a long time, still has no explicit and detailed industry regulations on the setting of the maximum temperature, suitable crowd, what materials are safe to use, etc. But normally feet bath basin shouldn’t be electrified, however we can’t rule out the fact that a few products might not have been strictly checked before leaving the factory.

Many studies have shown that these top schools discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process through \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\". Wan Yuchong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate compared to all other ethnic groups.According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and request that the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions. They also hope that the schools that are being sued will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously sued Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
