{"translation1": "\"Is taking a bath in a bathtub with foam on your feet a sign of a leak? Choosing an appropriate bathtub can have good therapeutic effects on your feet, and today's Country Style editor will answer this question for you, hoping to be helpful to friends. With the enhancement of people's health awareness, bathtubs have become more and more popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged on the market, ranging from hundreds of yuan to thousands of yuan, providing consumers with a wide range of choices.On the relevant data, compared to traditional home appliances, health-related home appliances such as bathtubs are selling hot, but there is no special industry standard for bathtubs, so there are certain safety risks. \\\"It's too dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a gift for his father's birthday, but when his father soaked his feet in it, he felt a tingling sensation in his feet.At first, Mr. Li thought it was the vibration function of the bathtub that caused the sensation, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt a tingling sensation in his feet. Mr. Li tried writing with a pen, and to his surprise, the pen lit up. Mr. Li discovered that the water in the bathtub was electrified. Later, he contacted the store, and the store's attitude was not bad. Although they refunded the bathtub, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry regulation for the popular bathtub, such as whether it is suitable for what kind of people, what kind of materials are used, and whether it is safe at the highest setting. However, in general, bathtubs do not have electricity problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not be strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing a bathtub, it is recommended to choose a disassembled type.Water and electricity separation has no safety hazards.

{"translation1": "\"A group of Asian-American organizations filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on May 23, alleging that three Ivy League universities, including Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College, discriminated against Asian-American applicants in the admissions process. The Asian American Education Foundation, which led the lawsuit, held a press conference in Washington on the same day to announce the complaint.The chairman of this organization, Wan Yuchong, said at a press conference that over the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission criteria of American top schools has doubled, but the proportion of Asians in these three schools has basically remained the same. Many studies have shown that these top schools discriminate against Asian applicants in their admission process through \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\". Wan Yuchong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that among these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians had the lowest admission rate compared to all other ethnic groups.According to data from the U.S. Department of Education, among Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have been implementing de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhao Yuchun told a reporter from Xinhua News Agency that they hope to submit a complaint and request that the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate and take action to prevent these schools from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in their admissions. They also hope that the schools that are being sued will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been sued have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Foundation was established in 2015 and previously sued Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the case due to procedural reasons. This time, in addition to the Chinese American community, other groups such as the Indian American, Japanese American, Korean American, and Pakistani American education organizations have also participated in the lawsuit.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"5\", \"Explanation\": \"The text is highly fluent.
