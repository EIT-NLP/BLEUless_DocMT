All guitarists dream of the warmth and dynamics of a tube amplifier: they expect a fat sound, nuanced reproduction of playing dynamics and string attack, and prompt response. During an in-depth analysis, VOX engineers discovered that the output stage determines the tube character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology based on this finding.The valve reactor circuit with a 12AX7 tube in every VT+ amplifier embodies the behavior, the subtle nuances, and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "Since its introduction in 2001, the Valvetronix series from VOX has continuously been improved, which has lead to, among other things, the combination of groundbreaking modeling technology with the “Valve Reactor” circuit with which the behavior of a tube amplifies is perfectly reproduced.

{"translation1": "\"I am fed up with Sky Sport F1 Hello dear F1 fans, over the course of the season, the quality on German Sky has decreased more and more, so I want to vent a bit with this post. First of all, the transmission was interrupted mid-F2 race today to start the F1 pre-coverage on time.Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning had put the schedule far behind schedule, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision (!). Apparently, however, this is not possible for legal reasons, so that everything else has to be restricted, which is why Sky DE probably had no choice. Nevertheless, it is stupid, especially since Sky UK was able to broadcast the end of the race.Nevertheless, a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartjes did a good job of accompanying the difficult situation around the heavy accident. Then there was rule ignorance among the F1 commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, as both did not know that you can change tires under a red flag. Although there were similar situations in Imola, Baku, and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to change tires when there were corresponding radio messages about Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that this was possible for Verstappen. In my opinion, such basic rules should simply be known if you commentate on F1 at a pay-TV broadcaster. It is also not the first puzzle-guessing, as now according to the rules, both have simply constant uncertainties in the subject of rules.I do not generally like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I acknowledge that it is a matter of taste. However, I seriously prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL. In addition, there are constant silliness that both simply appear unprofessional, such as ordering coffee from (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.Just the latter brings a lot of turmoil into the commentary, as he apparently does not take it seriously. Not least, advertising simply takes over at Sky, where in the final round, Sky is the only channel that goes into advertising, as can be heard on F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary is available directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this.Even these two broadcasters make less advertising during training than Sky, and they are free-to-air broadcasters. However, one must praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone does not overcome the disadvantages. The rest of Sky Sport F1's program is also very meager and full of repeats.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-language broadcaster that covers the F1. Unironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they are still allowed to broadcast. Thus, the fantastic F1 season is much less enjoyable than it would be with a reasonable broadcaster.I would like to hear your opinion.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Cohesion\": { \"Lexical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ], \"Grammatical Cohesion Mistakes\": [ ] } }", "reference": "I am annoyed with Sky Sport F1 Hello F1 fans, the quality of German Sky decreased over the course of the season, such that I want to clear it up some with this post. First things first, today the transmission broke off in the middle of the F2 race in order to punctually begin the pre-show reporting of the F1. It was because of the delayed start and the falling accident that the schedule was so far behind what was planned, but you still could have let the last (planned) 10 minutes show as well as the tournament decision (!). Apparently because of legal reasons, F1 has priority and because of that everything else needs to be restricted such that Sky Germany didn’t really have a choice here. It is still dumb, because Sky UK transmitted the race up until the very end. In spite of that, some small praise: the announcer Olivier Zwartyes was a good accompaniment to the difficult situation and the unfortunate accident. In the F1 there was even knowledge gaps of the rules in the commentary by Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, both of them didn’t know that during a red flag the tires are allowed to be changed. Although this situation already came up this year in Imola, Baku and Silverstone, they both first came to the conclusion that Verstappen was allowed to switch his tires following corresponding radio messages on the topic to Hamilton. The announcers at Sky UK and RTL knew immediately that this was a possibility for Verstappen. I am of the opinion that knowledge of such elementary rules should be assumed if you are going to provide F1 commentary on a paid-for TV broadcaster. It's also not the first guessing game as to what is possible or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties regarding rules. In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher. This last part really brings a lot of agitation into the commentary which he doesn’t take seriously. Not least of all, the advertising is just so prevalent on Sky, in the cool-down lap Sky is the only broadcaster that still goes to commercials, like you can hear this on F1TV, because only the German audio track comes out without commentary right after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do this. Both of these broadcasters also do less commercials than Sky during training, and they are free TV broadcasters. You even have to congratulate Glock and Baumgartner for their work, but that alone doesn’t cause me to overlook the disadvantages. The normal program from Sky Sport F1 is also very sparse and full of repetitions. All in all, Sky is really the worst German-speaking broadcaster that transmits the F1. In all honesty, RTL does a better job of transmitting the four races which they are allowed to transmit, including even the advertisements. At any rate, it really makes the grand F1 season considerably less fun as would be the case with a reasonable broadcaster. I would be really interested in your opinion."}
