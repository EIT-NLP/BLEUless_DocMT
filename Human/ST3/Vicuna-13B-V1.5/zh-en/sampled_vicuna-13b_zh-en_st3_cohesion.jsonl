Mr. Li tried it with a pen, and the pen surprisingly lit up. Mr. Li discovered that there was electricity in the water of the foot bath.

The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three top schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called \\\"holistic review\\\" admission process, systematically and continuously. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the admission rate of Asians relative to the total number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhu Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in admissions. They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds.
