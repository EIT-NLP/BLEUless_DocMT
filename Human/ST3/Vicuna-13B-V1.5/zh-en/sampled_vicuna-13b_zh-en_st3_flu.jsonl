Today, the editor of JD.com will answer this question and hope to help friends. With the increase in people's awareness of health, foot baths are becoming more and more popular, and a variety of products with different specifications have emerged in the market, ranging from over a hundred to thousands of yuan. This has given consumers a lot of space for choice.In related data tables, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-related household appliances such as bathtubs are booming, but bathtubs do not have a dedicated industry standard, so there is a certain safety risk. \\\"It's really dangerous to soak your feet in electric water!\\\" Mr. Li told reporters. Recently, he bought a bathtub as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt numbness in his feet when soaking in the bathtub.Mr. Li initially thought it was the vibration function of the foot bath that caused it, but he didn't expect that even after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt numbness in his feet. Mr. Li tried it with a pen, and the pen surprisingly lit up. Mr. Li discovered that there was electricity in the water of the foot bath. Later, he contacted the merchant, and the merchant's attitude was not bad, although the foot bath was returned. Mr. Li still felt unsatisfied.Because he found that this popular bathtub for a long time has no clear and detailed industry regulations on the highest temperature setting, applicable population, and material safety, etc. However, in general, bathtubs are not prone to electrical problems, but it is not ruled out that some products may not have been strictly controlled during manufacturing. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular bathtub.\\\"Water and electricity are separated, with no safety hazards.

{"translation1": "\"Asian American groups file complaint against Yale and 2 other Ivy League schools for discrimination in admissions - Xinhua Net Xinhua News Agency Washington, May 23 (Reporter Xue Jianmei) 130 Asian American organizations in the United States submitted a joint complaint to the U.S. Department of Education and the Justice Department on the 23rd, protesting against discrimination against Asian American applicants by three Ivy League schools - Yale University, Brown University, and Dartmouth College - during the admissions process. The Asian American Education Alliance, which initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on the same day.The chairman of the organization, Zhao Yukong, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the admission requirements of American top schools has increased many times in the past 10 years, but the proportion of Asians in these three top schools has basically remained at the same level. Many studies have shown that these universities discriminate against Asian applicants in the so-called \\\"holistic review\\\" admission process, systematically and continuously. Zhao Yukong introduced that a study by Sanders et al. in 2014 showed that in these three schools, the admission rate of Asians relative to the total number of applicants was the lowest among all ethnic groups.Data from the US Department of Education also shows that among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest admission rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented de facto racial quotas for Asian applicants for over 20 years. Zhu Yukong told Xinhua News Agency reporters that they hope to submit a complaint and have the US Department of Education and the Justice Department investigate, and take measures to stop these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in admissions. They also hope that the complained-against universities will take this issue seriously and change their admission policies towards Asian students.Currently, the three universities that have been complained about have not yet responded. The Asian American Education Alliance was established in 2015 and had previously complained about discrimination in Harvard University's admissions, but the US Department of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to American Chinese organizations, this time's complaint also includes Indian, Korean, Japanese, and Pakistani American educational organizations.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"This text is mostly fluent with a structured narrative and clear messaging.
