{"translation1": "\"I am frustrated with Sky Sport F1. Hello F1 fans, throughout the season, the quality on German Sky has been decreasing, so I wanted to take a break from this post. First of all, today, during the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to start the F1 pre-race show on time.Although the delayed start and the accident at the beginning of the time plan were far behind the planning, it was still possible to show the last (planned) ten minutes and the championship decision. It seems, however, that due to legal reasons the F1 priority is enjoyed and therefore everything else has to be restricted, so that Sky DE here had no choice. Stupid, especially since Sky UK has broadcasted the end of the race.Despite a small praise: commentator Olivier Zwartyes has handled the difficult situation around the serious accident well. Then there was again a rule violation by the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so both did not know that under a red flag the tires could be changed. Although this situation occurred in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both only came to the conclusion that Verstappen could change the tires when they received corresponding radio messages from Hamilton.At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was a possibility of deviation. In my opinion, such fundamental rules should be known when commenting on F1 at a Pay-TV channel. It's also not the first time they've had to guess what's allowed or required by the rules, both of them have constant uncertainties in the topic of rules.Generally, I don't like the artificial commentary style of Roos, but I have to admit that it's a matter of taste. But honestly, I prefer Heiko Wasser from RTL even more. There are constant stupidities that both of them do, which make them look unprofessional, like ordering coffee from the (equally clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or \\\"UuuuuHD\\\" from Ralf Schumacher.The last one brings a lot of chaos to the comments, which he apparently doesn't take seriously. Last but not least, advertising takes over at Sky, in the final round Sky is the only broadcaster that goes into advertising, as we can hear at F1TV, where only the German audio track without commentary comes directly after the race. Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.These two channels make less advertising during training than Sky, and that as a free-TV channel. Although we have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not make me overlook the disadvantages. The rest of the program of Sky Sport F1 is also very poor and full of repetitions.Overall, Sky is really the worst German-speaking channel that broadcasts F1. Ironically, RTL does a better job with the four races they still broadcast, except for advertising.

In general I don’t really like the artificial style of the commentary from Roos, but I’ll admit that is a manner of taste. But even Heiko Wasser from RTL does it better in my honest opinion. Additionally, there are just absurdities, which make the two of them seem unprofessional, like the ordering of coffee with the (just as clueless) reporter Peter Hardenacke or the “Ahhhh HD” from Ralf Schumacher.
