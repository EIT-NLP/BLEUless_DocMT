{"translation1": "\"Is the tingling sensation when soaking feet in a hot tub due to an electrical leak? Choosing the right hot tub can have great therapeutic benefits, and today's National Beauty editor will provide an answer to this question, hoping to be of help to friends. With the increasing awareness of health, hot tubs are becoming increasingly popular among consumers, and a variety of products with different price ranges are available on the market, from a few hundred to thousands of dollars, giving consumers a lot of choice.In relevant data tables, compared with traditional household appliances, sales of health-type household appliances such as foot spas have exploded, but there are no specific industry standards for foot spas, so there are certain safety risks. \\\"Electric foot baths are too dangerous, aren't they?\\\" Mr. Li told the reporter. Recently, Mr. Li bought a foot spa as a birthday gift for his father, but his father felt his feet going numb while soaking them.Mr. Li initially thought that the vibration function of the foot bath was the cause, but after turning off the vibration function, his father still felt his feet numb. Mr. Li tried using an electric pen, and to his surprise, the electric pen lit up. Mr. Li was shocked to discover that there was actually an electric current in the foot bath water. Later, he contacted the seller, and the seller's attitude was not bad, although they had to return the foot bath, Mr. Li still felt uncomfortable.Because he found that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular hot tub regarding the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that are harmless, he realized that there is no clear and detailed industry standard for the already popular hot tub regarding the highest temperature setting, the applicable people group, and the materials that are harmless. However, in general, hot tubs are not likely to have electrical issues, but it is not completely ruled out that some products may have manufacturing defects. Therefore, when purchasing, it is recommended to choose a modular hot tub.The separation of water and electricity has no safety risks.

The Asian-American EducationThe chairman of the organization, Zhou Yukun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions of American Ivy League schools has grown exponentially in the past 10 years. However, the percentage of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has remained relatively stable. Many studies have shown that these high schools in the so-called \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\" recruitment process have a long-term and systematic bias against Asian applicant students. Zhou Yukun introduced that according to the research of Sedgwick et al. in 2014, in these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians have the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnicities.According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Duke University have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota of over 20 years for Asian applicants. Zhou Yusheng told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope to submit an appeal and expect the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to conduct an investigation after confirming the facts, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students. They also hope that the accused universities will actively pay attention to this issue and change their Asian recruitment policies.Currently, there has been no response from the three high schools that have been accused. The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of programmatic reasons. This time, in addition to US-based Chinese organizations, other US-based organizations such as Indian, Korean, Japanese, Pakistani and other Asian education organizations also participated in the appeal.\"", "gpt_response": "{ \"Fluency\": { \"Score\": \"4\", \"Explanation\": \"The English portion of the text is generally well-written and comprehensible with minor errors that do not significantly hinder understanding. The error of naming Duke University instead of Dartmouth College as one of the Ivy League schools is a factual mistake but doesn’t detract from the fluency. Minor grammatical issues such as the slightly awkward phrase 'The Asian-American EducationThe chairman' due to a missing space, or inconsistency in referencing the researcher as 'Zhou Yukun' and later 'Zhou Yusheng,' indicate slight neglect in proofreading but these are minor and do not majorly impact the flow or comprehension of the document.
