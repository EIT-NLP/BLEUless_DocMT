The Asian-American EducationThe chairman of the organization, Zhou Yukun, said at the press conference that the number of Asian applicants who meet the conditions of American Ivy League schools has grown exponentially in the past 10 years. However, the percentage of Asians in these three Ivy League schools has remained relatively stable. Many studies have shown that these high schools in the so-called \\\"comprehensive consideration\\\" recruitment process have a long-term and systematic bias against Asian applicant students. Zhou Yukun introduced that according to the research of Sedgwick et al. in 2014, in these three schools, the relative number of applicants, Asians have the lowest acceptance rate among all ethnicities.According to data from the US Department of Education, among all Ivy League schools, Brown University and Duke University have the lowest acceptance rates for Asian students. Yale University and Brown University have implemented a de facto racial quota of over 20 years for Asian applicants. Zhou Yusheng told Xinhua News Agency reporter that they hope to submit an appeal and expect the US Department of Education and the Justice Department to conduct an investigation after confirming the facts, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students. They also hope that the accused universities will actively pay attention to this issue and change their Asian recruitment policies.Currently, there has been no response from the three high schools that have been accused. The Asian Education Alliance was established in 2015, at which time it filed a complaint against Harvard University for discriminatory admissions, but the US Department of Education rejected it on the grounds of programmatic reasons.

Asian American Coalition for Education, who initiated the complaint, held a press conference in Washington on that day. According to the speech made by Zhao Yukong, chairman of the group, during the past 10 years, the number of Asian applicants who met the admission qualification of famous universities in the US has doubled and redoubled; however, in these famous universities in the US, the proportion of Asian students basically maintained at the same level. According to lots of research results, these universities “discriminated against Asian students in a long-term, continuous and systematic way” during the so-called “comprehensive consideration”of the admission process. As introduced by Zhao Yukong, according to research results of scholars such as Saunders in 2014, in these 3 universities, Asian students have the lowest acceptance rate among all the ethnic groups considering the number of applicants. Data from Department of Education of the US also indicates that among all the Ivy League Universities, Brown University and Dartmouth College have the lowest acceptance rate of Asian students; Yale University and Brown University have been implementing racial quota of Asian applicants for more than 20 years. Zhao Yukong told the journalist of Xinhua News Agency that they wished that Ministry of Education and Ministry of Justice of the US could conduct investigation after they submitted the complaint, and take measures to prevent these universities from continuing to discriminate against Asian students in the admission process after identifying the facts. They also wished that the universities being complained about could pay attention to this issue on their own initiative and change the recruitment policy for Asian students. The 3 universities being complained about have not responded yet. Established in 2015, Asian American Coalition for Education once made a complaint against Harvard University about admission discrimination, but the US Ministry of Education did not accept the complaint on procedural grounds. In addition to Asian groups in the US, the groups involved in the complaint also include Indian, Korean, Japanese Americans and Pakistani education groups in the US."}
